241246,Computational Statistics For Phylogenetic Trees,DMS,MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY|INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM,1-Sep-03,24-Sep-09,"Holmes, Susan",CA,Stanford University,Continuing grant,Junping Wang,31-Aug-10,737913,,susan@stat.stanford.edu,340 Panama Street,STANFORD,CA,94305,6507232300,MPS,7334|1260,OTHR|4075|0000,0000099    Other Applications NEC                  |,241246,"0241246  Holmes  	Classical statistics has developed various averages, projections and representations based on linear algebra. In recent years, non-numerical data and parameters have emerged. The object of this project is to provide ways of averaging, building confidence regions, running Monte Carlo algorithms, doing regression and testing models for rooted binary trees. Currently biologists validate their phylogenetic trees by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the columns of DNA sequences and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to the branches of a consensus tree. This reduces the problem to a collection of binomial parameters, losing much of the multivariate information. A more geometrical procedure based on confidence regions in tree space is preferable and overcomes the multiple testing problem. The projects extends both Bayesian and frequentist inferential procedures for binary trees to a nonparametric context using a complete geometric construction of the relevant tree space. The mathematical tools include probability theory, topology and algebraic combinatorics. Collaboration with Louis Billera and Karen Vogtmann (Cornell Mathematics Dept.) has enhanced our mathematical understanding of tree space. The space of trees has negative curvature, thus we know we can define geodesics on this space as well as convex hulls. Many of the actual distance computations can have exponential complexity, good approximation algorithms are important for the applications considered. This work helps think about the statistics of biological networks as generalizations or mixtures of trees.  	A new type of data has appeared in genetics and molecular biology, these data are not real numbers or vectors, but trees, family trees or phylogenetic trees relating different species and hierarchical clustering trees relating different genes according to their differing expression patterns. This project provides programs for visualizing and doing statistics on these new data, we will provide the biologists with open source computer packages that they can use to analyze their own data. For instance, classical linear regression is based on projections; in the same way if we want to compare two sets of trees, we will use distances and methods for projecting in tree space. The project includes two workshops, one for mathematicians in the first stage, to publicize some of the harder open problems, and another in the last year to teach biologists how to use the geometrical tools developed in matlab or R in practical examples.

Membranes are integral to controlled drug release, medical devices, and biomimetics. The intellectual merit of this IGERT program is that it addresses a major challenge identified by the North American Membrane Society to integrate classical membrane science with bio-applications. This IGERT capitalizes on several opportunities at the University of Cincinnati (UC): (1) the Colleges of Engineering, Medicine and Pharmacy are on the same campus; (2) UC is a site of the only NSF Membrane Center; (3) an NSF REU Program in membrane science is established; (4) the State-funded Bio/Start technology incubator is on campus; and (5) an industry-internship program is well-established.    The goals include developing an interdisciplinary graduate training program, attracting pharmaceutical and biomedical industry participation, and facilitating a revenue stream to insure self-sustaining operation. The training program involves nine required courses and three courses focused within the pharmaceutical, biosensor, or biomedical track in the traineeship program. A series of required lab rotations is designed to facilitate cross-disciplinary awareness. An international technical/cultural experience is possible with Kyoto Technical University, the Australian National University and the University of Twente.     The broader impacts of this IGERT program are that it will provide a forum for interdisciplinary training in a critical emerging research area, stimulate a new research direction in bio-applications for the NSF Membrane Center, create a formalized structure that integrates classical and bio-applications of membranes,  catalyze the growth of the new Biomedical Engineering Department at UC, facilitate effective university/industry interaction, encourage the formation of interdisciplinary research teams, lead to research results that will improve health care and the quality of life, and generate patentable intellectual property and industry funding to sustain this IGERT program.    IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In this sixth year of the program, awards are being made to institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF."

In  particular, the principal investigator and collaborators will  investigate cell proliferation control via Rb-E2F, and DNA repair  and cell death control via p53-Mdm2.  Models of the behavior of  these biological modules can be tested against a substantial  supply of available experimental data, and within the models one  can test and refine ideas about mechanisms and pathways, perhaps  exploring scenarios which are hard to test in real molecular  biology experiments.    Mathematical methodologies useful in exploring important problems  in molecular cell biology include the theories of dynamical  systems and bifurcation.  Dynamical systems are models for  natural phenomena that change continuously with time, while  bifurcation theory studies models of phenomena that may change  dramatically in an instant after evolving continuously for a  while (think of a balloon popping after it gradually inflates to  an overfull state).  Cellular processes regulated by particular  genes can exhibit both steady and suddenly changing behavior, and  the principal investigator and collaborators are studying  important cellular cycles (proliferation, plus DNA repair and  death control) with mathematical and computational tools.

Although many genes are ubiquitously expressed, others are expressed in a restricted number of cell types or tissues at specific stages of development.  Recent evidence suggests that altering the composition the core RNA polymerase II transcription machinery may regulate cell type-specific transcriptional activation.  This is in contrast to the more traditional model that presumes combinations of transcriptional activator and repressor proteins regulate the time and place of transcription.  The core machinery, although essential for the process of transcription, is not usually what determines the choice of promoters used during transcriptional initiation.  The mechanisms that allow alternative forms of the general transcription machinery to differentially recognize specific promoters and thereby regulate tissue-specific transcription are not completely understood.   The scientific program uses Drosophila germline differentiation as a model system to investigate the contributions of alternative forms of the general transcription machinery to developmentally regulated gene expression.  Execution of the spermatogenesis cellular differentiation program in Drosophila depends upon transcription of a cohort of spermatid differentiation genes in germline cells.  This transcriptional program requires the function of several genes including no hitter, cannonball, and meiosis I arrest, which are testis-specific homologs of TFIID subunits.  Drosophila also express a testis-specific TFIIA subunit homolog.  Interestingly, mammals express testis-specific homologs of TFIID and TFIIA subunits, suggesting the mechanisms regulating transcription of spermatid differentiation genes are conserved and that insights gleaned from study of Drosophila germline will contribute knowledge concerning reproductive health in humans.  The educational program will incorporate undergraduates into the scientific research program.  Independent laboratory research is an essential educational component for young scientists, future medical doctors and science teachers.  Drosophila spermatogenesis offers a model system with genetic and molecular techniques that are relatively simple to master and yet intellectually challenging.  The program will familiarize students with the scientific process and methodology valuable in a broad spectrum of life science careers, and stimulate the intellectual exhilaration that comes from independent research.  An Advanced Genetics course will incorporate modern genetic analysis with traditional genetic subject matter, and the associated laboratory course will use Drosophila to demonstrate common genetic and molecular techniques that are applicable to mutational analysis in a wide range of organisms.  The semester long project in the laboratory class will allow students to analyze previously uncharacterized male-sterile mutants."

Model selection for semiparametric regression  models consists of two components: model selection (such as choice of  smoothing parameters) for the nonparametric component, and variable selection  for the parametric portion. Traditional variable selection  schemes, such as the stepwise deletion and the best subset variable  selection, could be extended to semiparametric modeling, but they are  expensive in computation since they require the smoothing parameters to  be selected for each submodel. The objectives of this proposal are to  develop new widely applicable model selection procedures for three  classes of semiparametric models which provide a unified framework for  many existing semiparametric regression models in the literature. In this  proposal, the PI (a) studies the asymptotic behaviors of the proposed  estimators, (b) demonstrates how the rate of convergence of the resulting  estimator depends on the regularization parameter, (c) shows that the proposed  procedures perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection  for semiparametric regression models, and (d) addresses issues related to  implementation of the proposed procedures. The PI also examines finite  sample performance via extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies and  applies the proposed procedures to analysis of real data.      With modern data collection devices and vast data storage space, one can  easily collect high-dimensional data, such as biotech data, financial data,  satellite imagery and hyperspectral imagery. Analysis of high-dimensional  data poses many challenges for statisticians and is becoming the most  important research topic in statistics. This proposal (a) lays down  a well-grounded and comprehensive framework for model selection for  semiparametric regression modeling in high-dimensional data analysis,  (b) has significant impact on the future research of high-dimensional  statistical modeling, and (c) enhances significantly the availability  of statistical tools and software for high-dimensional statistical modeling.  The proposed work is incorporated into a new topic course from which  graduate students may directly benefit. The proposed work also  benefits a broad range of scientists and researchers in various fields, including  automotive engineering, medical studies, prevention studies, public health  and social sciences."

Humes,31-Dec-09,137312,,dcarpenter@latte.harvard.edu,1350 MASSACHUSETTS AVE,Cambridge,MA,2138,6174955501,SBE,1371,OTHR|0000,,351048,"This proposal offers a radically different approach to studying how and why attention is allocated to problems, an approach that overcomes the limitations of many studies of agenda setting and social problem construction. It both builds and marks an advance on decades of important study devoted to the question of why some social problems draw a great deal of attention from government officials, the public, and the media while other problems receive little notice (Baumgartner and Jones 1993; Best 1990; Blumer 1971; Cobb and Ross 1997; Gusfield 1981; Hilgartner and Bosk 1988; Kingdon 1995; Schattschneider 1975; Schneider and Ingram 1993; Spector and Kitsuse 1973; Walker 1977). One body of work emphasizes the characteristics of problems themselves as important determinants of attention.      This research has helped to underscore how the groups in society who are burdened by problems and the organized advocates who take an interest in problems affect the attention those problems receive; problems are constructed through a ihsocial process.le Other work on agenda-setting, however, focuses on aspects of the attention allocation process that help determine which problems receive attention. This research has demonstrated how temporal dynamics as well as the interplay between various sub-agendas (e.g., Congress, the media) affect which problems make their way into the public arena. Despite the evidence that aspects of both process and problem are integral to the phenomenon of attention allocation, researchers have tended to focus solely on one of these dimensions. Thus, empirical generalizations tend to emerge from incomplete or misspecified models.      The proposed project proceeds theoretically from the idea that the phenomenon of allocating attention to problems is a complex function both of problem characteristics (such as problem burden, the size and nature of organized communities associated with a problem, and a problem's cultural valence), and of process-oriented dynamics (such as the relationships that exist among the agendas of different institutions; the temporal dynamics of agenda setting, and the relationships between different problems jockeying for agenda space). Empirically, the project proposes to compare the attention given to multiple problems over time in different arenas in order to discriminate between the process-oriented and problem-oriented determinants of the attention allocation process.     This is accomplished by studying attention to 37 different diseases by the media, by government, and by the scientific community across 25 years.  Disease offers a powerful lens to view the problem-specific and process-related dynamics of the attention  generating process because diseases are both medical facts and social constructions, and because diseases have clearly defined outcomes, like hospitalization or death, so that their severity can be gauged with a common metric.    This study of the problem- and process-oriented determinants of agenda setting offers both scholarly and practical rewards. The research design promises to advance the theoretical and empirical understanding of both social problem construction and agenda setting. Moreover, because of the specific focus on disease, the findings will address major policy issues: how the government responds to public health priorities, as reflected in the media and via organized interest groups; how disparities in disease burden by race/ethnicity, sex and age shape priorities; how these priorities inform the complex decisions made by pharmaceutical companies, both in their research and development of new drugs and in their marketing of existing ones; and how government budgetary decisions might reflect (if not magnify) these priorities. More broadly, the proposed project speaks to how societal resources are selectively allocated across a field of seemingly equally attention-worthy social problems."

Interest in the vital nutritional role of essential fatty acids has drawn the attention of diverse fields such as agriculture, aquaculture, and medical science. The human health benefits of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids ('fish oils') have made headlines in the popular press.  Still, the potential influence of fatty acids on community and ecosystem ecology is relatively understudied.  This project will conduct experiments utilizing a model aquatic food web to investigate two potential ways that fatty acids can contribute to our understanding of food web processes.  First, food rich in essential fatty acids should promote higher growth and physiological condition of consumers and thus support a higher trophic transfer efficiency than a system dominated by primary producers low in these essential compounds.   Second, this project will rigorously test the potential for using fatty acids as food web tracers.  The proposed experiments will simultaneously quantify both the effects of essential fatty acids on trophic transfer efficiency and the potential utility of specific fatty acids as trophic markers across three trophic levels: from algal primary producers, to herbivores, and to predators. This project will also train two graduate students at the interface of ecology and chemistry. At least one undergraduate student from an underrepresented group will participate in this project each year."

The team includes expertise in  numerical algorithms and scientific computing, fluid and solid  biomechanics, PDE optimization, inverse problems, medical image  analysis and processing, and distributed and grid computing necessary  to tackle this class of problems.    This project aims to create a framework for assimilating multimodal  dynamic medical image data to produce highly-resolved,  physically-realistic, patient-specific biomechanics models. While the  computational and algorithmic aspects of the project are widely  applicable, the target application will be the construction of  patient-specific cardiac biomechanics models from 4D image datasets of  heart motion. Such models are useful for medical diagnosis and  surgical planning. This places a premium on quick turnaround of the  computations, which mean they must be fast, scalable, and capable of  exploiting grid-based computing.    Research will focus on three key areas that undergird the project's  overall goals: registration, inversion, and distributed computing. The  registration research component will create multilevel algorithms to  extract cardiac deformation histories from time-varying medical image  datasets via the solution of sequences of 3D image registration  problems. The inversion research component will develop multilevel  algorithms that use these deformation field histories as virtual  observations to solve inverse problems for cardiac biomechanical  parameters. The distributed computing research component will create  tools for performance prediction and resource scheduling that support  simulations across distributed computational resources.    Dovetailing with the research components, the project will undertake  an educational program designed to communicate the fruits of its work  and of the wider benefits of the integration of the biomedical  sciences, computing sciences, and computational sciences, to a more  general audience of students, disciplinary researchers, and the lay  public. The professional activities of the team members in the  inversion, image registration, grid computing, and computational  science communities will be parlayed to organize workshops and  international meetings, edit volumes, teach summer schools, develop  university and short courses, and engage in outreach activities---as  they have done in the past---but with greater emphasis on the field of  computational biomedicine. The proposed image-based cardiac  biomechanics modeling application will provide an excellent  opportunity to demonstrate the benefits to health and welfare that  advances in optimization-based registration and inversion algorithms  and Grid computing can provide."

Through the collaboration of an interactive milieu of oceanographers and medical researchers, the PRCMB will conduct hypothesis-driven, interdisciplinary research on harmful algal blooms (HAB), water- and vector-borne diseases, and marine-derived pharmaceuticals and probes, in the thematic context of tropical coastal waters and small islands.    HAB research will focus on the ciguatera problem, which is unique to the tropics.  Specific goals of the research will include (1) a better understanding of the ecology of Gambierdiscus toxicus, with the expectation of identifying management strategies for reducing the frequency of outbreaks, (2) the development of inexpensive, broadly applicable, and rapid methods for testing for the presence of the ciguatoxin in fish, and (3) the development of methods to measure low concentrations of the toxin in humans, with the expectation of determining whether chronic exposure to ciguatoxin may be associated with enigmatic health conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome.    Research relevant to water-borne pathogens will explore the feasibility of determining human health risks associated with water contact through the direct detection of pathogens in two ways: (1) the use of molecular biological methods to determine the presence, viability, and virulence of a subset of enteric pathogens with the expectation of developing a practical water quality testing protocol based on molecular biological methods and (2) the use of marine bivalves as natural concentrators and sequesters of pathogens with the expectation that the concentration of certain pathogens in bivalves may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in water quality monitoring.    The marine pharmaceutical project will take advantage of recent advances in microbial isolation and culturing methods and the unique and largely unexplored tropical microbial flora surrounding the Hawaiian Islands to (1) isolate and culture marine micro-organisms from tropical coastal and open ocean seas, (2) screen these organisms for the production of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals with potential public health applications, particularly the treatment of neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases, and (3) develop molecular genetic tools for the isolation and expression of relevant biosynthetic genes and for expression of pathways in host organisms for the production of marine pharmaceuticals.    These research programs will be supported by a core microbial culture and characterization facility that will provide microbial biomass for screening and the isolation of secondary metabolites, develop new enrichment culture isolation techniques, provide and maintain analytical facilities (GC/MS and LC/MS/MS) for PRCMB scientists, and engage faculty from other disciplines in collaborative work with Center investigators.  A Pilot Project Program will carry out exploratory research that complements major projects or addresses gaps in the scientific agenda of the PRCMB.    The intellectual merit of the Center lies in its convergence of the complementary strengths and multidisciplinary expertise within the University of Hawaii School of Ocean, Earth Sciences and Technology, the John A. Burns School of Medicine, the College of Natural Sciences, the Water Resources Research Center, the Pacific Biomedical Research Center, and the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, as well as the State of Hawaii Department of Health, to conduct trans-disciplinary research that will produce new knowledge about the profound impacts of the ocean on human health.  This newfound knowledge will advance national health and lead to improved strategies to reduce the burden of human diseases resulting from acute and chronic exposures to risks in the ocean environment.    Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the Center reflect is tropical, small island context and the relevance of that theme to Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.  These ethnic groups have a keen interest in the ocean, and many aspects of the Center's activities will provide the cultural relevance needed to stimulate their interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers."

The overall goal of the Pacific Northwest Center for Human Health and Ocean Sciences is to elucidate the relationships between marine processes and public health consequences, by focusing specifically on the toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.  The Center will be composed of a multidisciplinary research team that includes researchers from universities as well as state and federal government agencies.  Studies will be conducted on Pseudo-nitzschia dynamics and human impacts in two major representative ecosystems, the Puget Sound Estuary and Washington coastal waters.  All fishery closures to date in Washington State have occurred along the coast where human settlement is limited.  In Puget Sound, where many more people could potentially be affected, no shellfish closures have yet occurred, although low-levels of domoic acid are commonly detected in mussels and clams.  The Center will explore underlying differences between the coastal environment in the Pacific Northwest and Puget Sound.    The research and support activity of the Center will encompass four research projects and four facility cores.  The Toxic Algae Research Project will examine the physical, chemical, and biological factors that promote blooms and toxin release and the genomics of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms.  The Shellfish Kinetics Project will study the toxin levels and environmental conditions at which acute or chronic health effects become important.  The Mechanisms of Toxicity Research Project will examine the molecular mechanisms of action of domoic acid and will define potential susceptibility factors affecting its toxicity such as age, chronic low dose exposure profiles and genetics.  The Human Exposure Research Project will investigate populations for dietary and consumption behaviors that contribute to increased exposure and will identify populations that are at potential risk based on age, cultural practices (Native American populations, Asian and Pacific Islanders), and geographic proximity to contaminated shellfish.  The Biosensors Facility Core will focus on new technologies to develop portable real time tools for assessing domoic acid.  The Environment Facility Core will use time series analysis to characterize variations in physical and chemical parameters of the coastal environment and the Puget Sound Estuary.  The Neurobehavioral Assessment Facility Core will define the effects of chronic low-level domoic acid exposure on neurobehavioral development.  The Informatics Facility Core will provide platforms and frameworks for data integration, risk evaluation, GIS and data visualization and community outreach, to allow the Center to share and translate information across these multidisciplinary arenas and with the external research communities.      Broader Impacts.  The Center has been designed in response to the societal need to understand the interactions between ocean processes and human health.  One major impact of the center will be to develop lasting partnerships among groups concerned with harmful algal blooms, including researchers at the University of Washington, University of Maryland Medical School, the Institute for Systems Biology, the Washington State Department of Ecology, Washington State Department of Health, Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NOAA) and U.S.  EPA Region 10.  A second impact is to provide informational resources and exchange with diverse communities with exposure and potential health risks from domoic acid.  Interactions with numerous groups, including Native American tribes and Asian-Pacific Islander communities, along the Washington coast and in the Puget Sound region have already been developed.  A community advisory board with interested and affected parties will be created to facilitate these exchanges and dialogue about harmful algal blooms.  A third impact is educational in nature.  The Center will educate a new generation of researchers with multidisciplinary training and expertise relevant for issues affecting oceans and human health.  Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers are included in all Center projects.  Undergraduate research at the University of Washington is highly promoted and labs commonly involve undergraduates in research projects.  A seminar series will be held on a monthly basis to foster communication between different Center components.  Additional special-topic courses (open to all students) will also be developed from Center collaborations."

This model pinniped species has been the focus of three decades of research in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.  Compared to the knowledge of pinniped diving physiology and ecology during early development and young adulthood, little is known about individuals nearing the upper limit of their normal reproductive age range. Evolutionary aging theories predict that elderly diving seals should exhibit senescence. This should be exacerbated by surges in the generation of oxygen free radicals via hypoxia-reoxygenation during breath-hold diving and hunting, which are implicated in age-related damage to cellular mitochondria. Surprisingly, limited observations of non-threatened pinniped populations indicate that senescence does not occur to a level where reproductive output is affected. The ability of pinnipeds to avoid apparent senescence raises two major questions: what specific physiological and morphological changes occur with advancing age in pinnipeds and what subtle adjustments are made by these animals to cope with such changes? This investigation will focus on specific, functional physiological and behavioral changes relating to dive capability with advancing age. The investigators will quantify age-related changes in general health and body condition, combined with fine scale assessments of external and internal ability to do work in the form of diving. Specifically, patterns of oxidative status and oxygen use with age will be examined. The effects of age on muscular function, contractile capacity in vascular smooth muscle, and exercise capacity via exercise performance in skeletal muscle will be examined. Data will be compared between Weddell seals in the peak, and near the end, of their reproductive age range. An assessment will be made of the ability to do external work (i.e. diving) as well as muscle functionality (ability to do internal work). The investigators hypothesize that senescence does occur in Weddell seals at the level of small-scale, proximate physiological effects and performance, but that behavioral plasticity allows for a given degree of compensation. Broader impacts include the training of students and outreach activities including interviews and articles written for the popular media. Photographs and project summaries will be available to the interested public on the project website. This study should also establish diving seals as a novel model for the study of cardiovascular and muscular physiology of aging. Research on Weddell seals could validate this model and thus develop a foundation for similar research on other species. Advancement of the understanding of aging by medical science has been impressive in recent years and the development of new models for the study of aging has tremendous potential benefits to society at large"

The modules center around the landmark 'A Civil Action' case in which eight families in Woburn, Massachusetts filed suit against two local industries alleging improperly handled toxic chemicals entered the groundwater system, traveled to two municipal supply wells, and consumption of the contaminated water by local residents caused childhood leukemia and other health disorders.  The modules are introducing the scientific methods and geoscience skills that enable students to explore, analyze, and interpret the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical datasets from the actual trial.  With these datasets and other course materials, students are constructing maps, graphs, and diagrams (used later as trial exhibits) to help them formulate and write their own professional opinions as 'expert witnesses' in the mock trial, where they present and defend their opinions before a judge and jury.       The project is fostering critical thinking skills, enhancing basic academic skills (data analysis, computational methods, and written and oral communication), and introducing scientific methods and geoscience skills.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in students manipulating the actual trial datasets; creating, interpreting, and explaining the maps and graphs that they created; applying a variety of scientific principles and methods to address a poignant real-world problem; and teaching students how to formulate and defend their own opinions.

A substantial amount of research in the past 15 years has demonstrated the interviewing conditions that produce the most accurate as well as the least accurate reports from young children. There has been, however, less success in identifying the cognitive, emotional, or social characteristics that make some children more suggestible than others; this may be due to the fact that the characteristics that predispose children to be influenced by suggestion change with age.  Supported by funds from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Maggie Bruck will address these issues.  This project examines the development of metasuggestibility (awareness that a person's report or memory of their personal experiences can be tainted by another person's statements or suggestions) in middle childhood and the degree to which this metacognitive skill is related to children's suggestibility.  Although research has primarily focused on the suggestibility of preschool children, a few recent studies have included older children (middle childhood 6-11 year olds), producing the surprising finding that these children also show relatively high rates of suggestibility (although lower than those of preschoolers).  The present research focuses on this age group to examine age-related mechanisms that underlie suggestibility, testing the idea that these mechanisms change as a function of development.  Study 1 involves three major components:  (1) To measure metasuggestibility, children view a filmed skit in which a child actor gives inaccurate answers to an adult's suggestive questions; the children are then asked to explain why this actor produced the inaccurate reports. (2) Relationships between metasuggestibility and children's performance on other metacognitive skills (detection of logical inconsistency, beliefs about memory, and understanding of others' minds) are analyzed for developmental changes.  (3) The relationship between children's actual performance when interviewed suggestively and their performance on the metasuggestibility task is examined.  Study 2, an intervention study, explores if metasuggestibility training decreases children's suggestibility. The major aim in both studies is to examine whether children must first realize that suggestive questions can distort memory in order to actively resist misleading questions.    This research will broaden the focus of suggestibility research from preschool to middle childhood.  By so doing, it overcomes an incorrect assumption that one should not be concerned about memory distortion among older children.  It will examine whether children with low levels of metasuggestibility are also the most suggestible children, as well as examine if training children to be aware of suggestion in interviews can reduce their own suggestibility.  The results of these studies will have important implications for constructing scientifically validated interviews that produce the most accurate reports from children and for constructing instruments to detect children who are prone to suggestive factors. These instruments can be adapted for use in schools, mental health, medical, and forensic contexts."

The PI will work with youth at the Boston Children's Hospital that have suffered severe renal and cardiac failure and who wouldn't otherwise survive without medical interventions such as heart and kidney transplants. An applied developmental model provides a framework to design ICEs. It also provides a model for doing research in complex real world settings. It is hypothesized that ICEs will 1) promote positive youth development (measured as competence, connection, character, confidence, caring and contribution to civil society), 2) complement and augment face-to-face psychosocial interventions, and 3) that the positive effects are due to design features and the nature of online activities that engage youth in cognitive, social and emotional development.

The most important such method is the quality-adjusted life year (or QALY), in which a patient's length of life is given weight proportional to quality of health.  However, numerous studies have demonstrated that the correlation between measured QALYs and a patient's current health is at best modest.  Moreover, it is known that individuals may trade lifetime for improved health quality when remaining lifetime is long, but not when it is short; and that those with poor health quality may prefer to survive only until important life milestones are achieved and no longer.  Current QALY models do not accomodate these sorts of phenomena.    To address these concerns, the investigators will examine methods for incorporating life goals into health preference models.  The QALY model already addresses ""ongoing goals"" that have impact proportional to length of life, such as minimizing chronic pain or maintaining physical mobility.  Other goals, termed ""extrinsic goals,"" such as completing an important project or seeing a child graduate from college, are qualitatively different; their achievement has impact independent of length of life.  These are not addressed by QALYs.  The investigators have generalized the QALY model to incorporate both ongoing goals and extrinsic goals.      Guided by this model, the investigators will conduct empirical studies to characterize the kinds of extrinsic goals that are important for the general public and medical patients.  They will conduct theoretical studies investigating potential preference models for extrinsic goals, methods for including multiple extrinsic goals, and impacts on published medical decision analyses when extrinsic goals are added.  They will determine if extrinsic goals can help explain plausible behavior forbidden by the QALY model or yield better correlation of measured preferences with current health than does QALY.        Despite its limitations, the QALY model has become the standard for modeling patient preferences in medical cost-effectiveness analyses.  The investigators' extrinsic-goal model constitutes a fundamental and original augmentation of this standard.  It has the potential to benefit society by substantially broadening the types of patient and community preferences included in these analyses."

The NDPSS is a social indicators, infrastructure, and data dissemination program. Its gather data that allows us to (1) monitor and explain trends, changes and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes and examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role of various sub-groups; (2) compare the United States to other societies, by developing cross-national models of human society; and (3) make high quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, and others with minimal cost and waiting.  NDPSS data are collected through the General Social Survey (GSS) and its allied surveys in the International Social Survey Program (ISSP).   The GSS is a regular, ongoing interview survey of U.S households conducted by the National Opinion Research Center.  The mission of the GSS is to make timely high-quality scientifically relevant data available to social science researchers.  Since 1972 the GSS (with NSF support) has conducted 25 in-person, cross-sectional surveys of the adult household population of the U S with approximately 44,000 respondents. GSS content is wide ranging with approximately 4,500 variables overall.  There is broad base participation in the development of the GSS.  Many prominent scholars help develop topical modules. For example, 74 researchers from 48 universities and research institutes have served on the GSS Board and 253 social scientists in a dozen disciplines from 147 institutions have participated in the design of the last 28 topical modules in the GSS.     The GSS has spurred cross-national research by inspiring other nations to develop data collection programs modeled on the GSS and by joining with the International Social Science Program (ISS).  Since 1984 ISSP has grown to 39 nations. The GSSDIRS website is extremely popular with users, having over 4,000,000 visits in 2003. The ISSP website was visited over 203,000 times during the last 12 months.  The user community includes researchers, college teachers, university students, business planners, media and public officials.  Sociologists, political scientists, economists, statisticians, survey methodologists, anthropologists, geographers, biologists, engineers, psychologists, criminologist, legal scholars, medical/health researchers and business administration and management scholars use GSS data. This use of the GSS is widely documented in publications.  The PIs have able to document over 8,500 uses of the GSS: approximately 4,862 journal articles, 1,664 books, 1,364 scholarly papers, 568 reports, and 188 dissertations and theses.  Most users (82%) have been academics with college affiliations. Research usages reached 200 per annum in the late 1980s and 300 per annum in the early 1990s. Current use is now at over 600 per annum.    This renewal includes several enhancements, upgrades and innovations to the GSS.  Specifically, it will 1) add contextual data to supplement individual-level information to place the individual in a social context; (2) expand our coverage of America's ethnic and cultural diversity by the development of Spanish versions of GSS instruments and conducting interviews in Spanish: (3) introduce a panel component to study change among individuals with a prospective panel; and (4) facilitate the collection of auxiliary data on other social units besides individuals and households.     Broader Impacts    The NDPSS has already had enormous impact beyond the boundaries of the survey itself. The GSS is held as the gold standard by which many other survey data collection activities are measured, and the ISSP program has led to innovations and developments in cross-cultural and cross-national research. The GSS thus serves as a model that is being emulated elsewhere, such as in the newly created European Social Survey program. The contributions of the GSS to the teaching of quantitative social science analysis are unprecedented. Its accessibility and ease of use has added value far beyond the original data collection efforts, and researchers in the social sciences continue to mine the data both old and new to advance knowledge and test theories. The GSS and ISSP program is part of the core infrastructure of social science research in the U.S."

Unfortunately, these ecosystems are being degraded worldwide due to infectious disease, human activities, and climate change.  Poorly studied members of this rapidly deteriorating ecosystem are the Bacteria and Archaea.  Although recent studies have made progress toward our understanding of coral-associated microbial communities, there are substantial areas that have not been explored.  Since these coral reef ecosystems are at risk, it is important to assess microbial biodiversity before habitat destruction worsens.  Their two key objectives for the NSF Biodiversity Survey and Inventories proposal are to (1) survey microbial diversity associated with three different coral species collected from two sites in the Caribbean, and (2) disseminate this information in an online database while promoting education and training of students and junior personnel.  Samples of coral mucus, coral tissue, and background seawater will be analyzed to distinguish the microbial communities uniquely associated with each sample type.  They will take both a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach to the survey. Carbon source utilization patterns and DNA fingerprinting approaches (e.g., denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, 16S rDNA cloning) will be used to characterize whole communities.  Microbial isolates will be characterized in terms of cell morphology and motility, growth characteristics, antibiotic resistance patterns, production of cell-signaling molecules, and phylogeny.  The data obtained will be channeled into a public, online database that will be developed by all members of the research team for the purposes of disseminating and sharing of information regarding coral microbial communities among the broader scientific community.   Educational opportunities at the high school, undergraduate  (through two NSF undergraduate research programs), graduate, and postdoctoral levels will be incorporated into each stage of the proposed project.  All members of the research team will work cooperatively in a very dynamic setting to both collect and evaluate the data, as well as contribute to website development and database design.  They will also develop a special topics course to be offered each summer of the proposed project entitled ""Coral Biology:  The Complex Role of Microorganisms in Coral Health and Disease.""  The proposed work will foster collaboration between two US-based educational institutions (Medical Univ. of South Carolina, Univ. of South Carolina-Aiken,), The Institute for Genomic Research (TGIR), and an international organization, the Colombian Institute for Marine and Coastal Research (INVEMAR)."

A primary focus of this project is to ""unlock"" such critical datasets by developing techniques and tools to anonymize very large databases. Such tools will facilitate the release of datasets to researchers, while insuring that the privacy of individuals is maintained.    Many organizations, including the Census Bureau and departments of health at the local, state, and federal levels, routinely publish aggregated forms of data because they can be used to answer statistical queries over selected subsets of the data. However, existing methods for aggregation have significant weaknesses and proposed improvements scale poorly.  In addition, the problem of building accurate predictive models (e.g., decision trees) from aggregated data has not been widely studied. There are many opportunities for building accurate predictive models from data aggregated to preserve privacy; conversely, the possibility of building such models suggests another way that sensitive information can be inadvertently ""leaked"" even when only aggregated data is published. This project aims to investigate the trade-off between privacy guarantees and the utility of the published data for specific analysis tasks, including: (a) privacy-preserving algorithms for aggregating large data sets, (b) algorithms for building predictive models using aggregated data, and (c) conditions under which accurate predictive models can be constructed from such data.    The project team includes the Chief Epidemiologist for the State of Wisconsin, who is the curator for many health-related datasets, a cancer researcher whose research program relies in part on datasets curated by the State, and three computer scientists with expertise in data mining and management.    This project will train graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin in the tradeoffs between privacy protection and accurate model building, and the results and tools will be widely disseminated through publications and the project's Web site (www-db.cs.wisc.edu/dbprivacy)."

The primary objective of the proposal follows. In responding to state and national needs to improve health, education, and the environment and to stimulate innovation and economic growth, the Advancing Biotechnology and Climatology (ABC) initiative has developed a two-pronged approach, seeking to develop 1) the new Institute for Biotechnology Partnerships (IBP) and 2) two model high schools that stimulate the transformation of knowledge created by the biotechnology and climatology industries to enhance K-12 education.     The intellectual merit of the project follows. Operating from the premise that organizations are complex adaptive systems, this proposal seeks to embark on the learning/unlearning process inherent in the work of innovative change. The proposed team effort involves and positions a broad base of talented, qualified stakeholders in a process of action research and learning. By leveraging the often-isolated pockets of resources and infrastructures in the targeted science fields, the two-pronged approach provides a coherent focus to the process, aimed at establishing substantive, systemic groundwork to more efficiently ensure that the understandings of science will have an impact the quality of life for the broader community. Strategies will emerge and evolve from the exchange of ideas and creation of innovative approaches across a varied array of participants in education, research, government and industry and infra, thereby strengthening the impact of the proposals outcomes.    The broader impact of the activity follows. ABC will have direct impact on low income, rural schools serving diverse populations and broad impact by creating a transferable model to increase the capacity of biotechnology and climatology. ABC seeks to (1) prepare and produce a science and technology literate workforce and citizenry, especially across rural regions; (2) facilitate the inclusion of underrepresented rural students and Native Americans in science and technology research; and, (3) educate students about science and innovations that impact public policy so that they are better informed for roles within our democracy. The dissemination plan of the model ensures national and international replication in similar rural contexts. Thus an infrastructure for networking to support regional economic growth will be created. This development of structures is designed to help biotechnology research and industry learn from the highly successful climatology industry and take advantage of a timely opportunity for growth and change in both sciences."

This research focuses on novel solutions for prominent signal processing problems in sensor network design: efficiently extracting information through distributed  (neighborhood-based) processing, mitigating practical difficulties such as node localization errors and spatially correlated measurements, and conserving energy through active node selection.  Distributed Bayesian algorithms are being developed for estimating physical phenomena in the presence of node location uncertainties; ignoring these uncertainties may lead to poor estimation and detection performance.  The investigators also study nonparametric distributed signal processing approaches under the practically important scenario where parametric models for the response function and noise distribution are unknown. Here, the goal is to provide reliable inference about the observed phenomenon that is comparable to that achieved using exact parametric models. Educational goals of the program include incorporating modern teaching techniques and statistical signal processing applications into the undergraduate engineering curriculum and integrating state-of-the-art signal processing into the graduate engineering curriculum at the Iowa State University. The research results and teaching tools developed in this project are made available to a broad scientific community through the Internet and publication in scientific journals."

Anthropologists have long recognized the importance of testing the adaptive advantages of local knowledge, but they have been hampered by limited methods for measuring individual intra-cultural variation of local knowledge. Furthermore, anthropologists have stressed how individual knowledge benefits the individual holding the knowledge more than how individual knowledge benefits others. The recent development and refinement of cultural consensus and cultural consonance methods from cultural anthropology provides researchers with the tools to fill the gaps.    In this project, to be carried out among the Tsimane, a native Amazonian population in Bolivia,  researchers propose to use these new methods to quantify parental knowledge of medical plants used to treat illnesses (anemia, infection, parasite, and physical growth) of children 2-15 years old. Researchers will estimate the effect of parental knowledge of medicinal plants on the objective child health of the parents' own children and their neighbor's children. They  hypothesize that parental knowledge will protect the health of their own children, and also produce positive benefits that accrue to other children outside of the family because one's own children have better health.     The specific aims of the research are to  (a) Present a theory and hypotheses about how and why local knowledge of medicinal plants benefits others beyond the person holding the knowledge, including parent's own children and children in neighboring households. (b) Use instrumental-variable techniques to get unbiased estimates of the effect of local knowledge on child health. (c) Create a public-use data set for others to test hypotheses beyond the ones examine here.

In the practice of critical care medicine it is current clinical practice to administer potent drugs that profoundly influence levels of consciousness, respiratory, and cardiovascular function by manual control based on the clinician's experience and intuition. This project will investigate the use of closed-loop control based on appropriate dynamical system models as an alternative means of improving drug delivery in the operating room and the intensive care unit. The PI will develop adaptive control algorithms using nonnegative and compartmental system theory for the specific problem of closed-loop control of drug dosing. Specifically, he will develop adaptive control and neural network adaptive control algorithms for intensive care unit sedation and itraoperative anesthesia.     Intellectual merit. Although the theories of adaptive and neuro adaptive control have been extensively addressed for linear and nonlinear systems in the literature, a unified linear and nonlinear control design framework for nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems remains relatively undeveloped. This is due to the fact that nonnegative and compartmental systems have highly specialized structures and control (source) inputs are usually constrained to be nonnegative as are the states of the compartments.   Broader benefits. This research will amalgamate control theory and pharmacology to provide efficient solutions to the challenging problem of automated anesthesia. Promising control algorithms will be implemented for the delivery of intraoperative anesthesia and intensive care unit sedation on site at the Northeast Georgia Medical Center. Payoffs would arise from improvements in medical care, health care, reliability of drug dosing equipment, and reduced cost for health care."

The approach proposed is based on approximate dynamic programming. Dual neural network architectures will be used to solve the equations resulting from an optimal impulse control formulation.    Intellectual merit of this research lies in realizing unified controller solutions to optimal impulse control problems that are important, yet difficult to solve. Outcome of this research is expected to advance the field of control in the area of impulse control. Furthermore, expected results from the proposed work will advance the state of the art in the field of neural networks since these investigations are based on new approximate dynamic programming formulations with neural network based solution structures.     Broader impact of this research will be in the applications areas. Systems with uncertainties in dynamics where control inputs occur on very short time scales with respect to the systems response time are pervasive and valuable. This class of systems characterizes dynamics of epidemics, insect control, inventory control, exchange rates, interest rates etc. Optimal solutions to such problems could lead to large improvements in cost savings and offer solutions in some health care areas and quality of life improvements. Outreach activities planned in this proposal include using women and minorities and disseminating results through non-engineering collaborators in the medical areas. The project results will be discussed through demonstrations to the area high schools in order to create early career interest in science and engineering."

Glycerol must be added to whole blood to prevent cell damage when it is frozen and must be removed before the blood is transfused.  Current removal strategies require procedures that are too lengthy for emergencies or military applications.  Using mathematical modeling (which includes models that couple fluid flow, convection diffusion, and transport across semipermeable membranes), optimization theory and numerical methods, the project will scale up laboratory tested removal protocols for medical use.  The research on optimal morphing uses differential geometry and elasticity theory to obtain cost functionals for minimal strain morphing.  Minima over admissible sets of deformations (diffeomorphisms between compact hypersurfaces) will be proved to exist using the calculus of variations, and numerical methods will be developed to approximate these minima.  The existence and stability of surface waves produced by flow over flat plates will be proved using fluid dynamical modeling and the theory of free boundary problems.  In addition, the mathematical analysis will be complemented with numerical simulations of a physical system.  Mathematical models of two-body interaction, where forces propagate with finite speeds, will be derived.  Such models consist of systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations coupled with ordinary differential equations, or hybrid systems of differential equations and delay equations.  The well-posedness and qualitative dynamics of the two types of models will be determined and models of this type will be applied to understand synchronization phenomena for acoustical surface wave sensors.    <br><br>    The research project has two main purposes: the application of mathematics to advance understanding in four fields of physical science and the training of four Ph.D. students in these important areas of applied mathematics.  The first project has direct applications in the health sciences and medicine.  Living cells, for example blood cells, can be preserved for long periods of time by freezing; and, they can later be thawed for use in transfusions.  To freeze and thaw living cells requires a complex technology including the addition of chemicals called cryoprotectants to the insides of the cells so they will not be damaged during this process.  These chemicals must be removed before blood is transfused.  Methods are available for doing this, but current methods require a long time to implement.  Thus, frozen blood is not available for emergency use (for example, in military conflicts or natural disasters).  Fast removal of cryoprotectants has been proved to be possible at the level of single cells; the purpose of the research in to design (optimal) methods that can be used for fast removal on the larger scale necessary for practical application in medicine.  The second project has applications in materials science.  A sheet of metal is to be bent and stretched into a desired shape.  The desired shape can be achieved by many different deformation processes (for example, the sheet can first be stretched then bent or it can be stretched in one direction while being bent in another, among many other possibilities).  Which method uses the least energy? This problem and others of the same type will be solved using mathematical analysis.  The third project will determine the stability of the surface waves often formed by a fluid (for example water) moving over a plate.  Surface waves are known to exist and have a particular shape.  Also, experiments show that when the waves are disturbed, they return rapidly to that particular shape.  But, the mechanism for this remarkable stability property is not known at present.  The research project will determine the reason for the observed stability.  The fourth research project is concerned with the theory of two-body interactions in physics and engineering.  A practical example occurs in applied acoustics.  Electrical currents applied to electrodes embedded in the surface of a silicon wafer causes acoustic surface waves to propagate across the wafer.  A second set of electrodes (transducers), embedded in the wafer, can transform these waves back to electrical currents.  When the electrodes and transducers are connected to an appropriate electrical circuit, such surface waves can be constantly produced and amplified by the circuit.  If a second set of electrodes and transducers are embedded in the surface on the same wafer, a second set of waves can be produced.  The two circuits can be tuned so that the waves oscillate in perfect synchrony.  A very sensitive detector can be constructed by covering half of the wafer (with one pair of electrodes and transducers) and exposing the other half to the environment.  If the surface of the second half is disturbed (for example, by the deposition of a hazardous biological agent) the synchrony is broken and this occurrence can be instantly detected by a computer connected to the circuits.  A goal of this research is to provide the mathematical theory for understanding the behavior of these devices."

The main focus is on fluid systems for  which a unique top-level periodic orbit of pseudo-Anosov type has  been ""built in.""  This work is accomplished using an integrated  program of theoretical, numerical, and experimental research.  In  particular, the investigators (1) advance the rigorous  mathematical theory underlying topological chaos; (2) use the  theory to develop an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms  of mixing in several canonical fluid flows of practical interest;  and (3) leverage these developments to advance current laminar  mixing technology.  The mathematical/theoretical and  numerical/experimental components of this project are mutually  supporting.  The theory provides ideas and a basic framework for  the design and analysis of fluid mixing, while the fluid  applications provide evidence for or against the posed  conjectures and suggest ideas for additional development of the  theory.  The intellectual merit of this work includes its  extensions of the Thurston-Nielsen theory, its contributions to  the fundamental understanding of fluid stirring and the role of  topological methods in global predictions of chaos, and its  detailed analysis of fluid systems of interest for practical  mixing enhancement.         Laminar fluid flow systems are at the center of numerous  major advances in medical, biological, chemical, and material  processing applications that are important for improving human  health, advancing scientific discovery, and maintaining national  security.  Fluid mixing is known to play a significant role in  these applications, and mixing enhancement is most often achieved  through efficient stirring.  Further advances in laminar mixing  enhancement are limited in part by the tools used to model,  analyze, and predict efficient stirring in laminar flows.  A  topological method based on a deep mathematical theory due to  Thurston and Nielsen has recently been applied to fluid stirring  enhancement by the investigators and others with quite dramatic  results.  The mathematical theory, when properly applied,  provides a means to ""design for chaos"" predictively.  The broader  impacts of this work include promoting teaching and learning at  the undergraduate and graduate levels, seeking to broaden the  participation of underrepresented groups in research, enhancing  interaction between the engineering and mathematics communities,  and benefiting society by developing the techniques for mixing  enhancement in laminar flow."

There are major challenges in these areas that are addressed by a team of researchers, who bring different but complementary skill sets to explore. Statistical Learning is widely recognized as a very active area of interdisciplinary research, which lives between statistics, computer science, and optimization. With state-of-art optimization tools, this research offers a set of new approaches for statistical learning, including new penalties for regularization, further developments of large margin classifiers both theoretically and numerically, as well as nonparametric-based probability calibration for hard margin classifiers. In addition, new visualization and analytical tools for ``High Dimension-Low Sample Size'' (HDLSS) data are developed. Such development is extremely important since HDLSS has become a common feature of data encountered in many divergent fields such as medical imaging and micro-array analysis for gene expression but is outside of the domain of classical statistical multivariate analysis. OODA is a generalization of the recently very productive area of Functional Data Analysis (FDA). In FDA, curves are data points and variation in a family of curves is the focus of analysis. OODA extends this notion to populations where the data points are more complex objects, such as images, shape representations, and even tree-structured objects. The proposed research offers a set of new tools for FDA, including exponential family functional principal components analysis (PCA), robust functional PCA, curve discrimination, and forecasting and dynamic updating of time series of curves. Proposed research will also advance OODA for data on smooth manifolds and tree-structured objects.    The main application area of the research is in health and medicine and civil infrastructure. The research is motivated by and will have beneficial impacts on cancer research, medical imaging, call center management, and network traffic modeling.  However, the developed statistical methods will be useful in fields far beyond those motivating this research, such as demography/epidemiology, financial economics and spatial-temporal modeling.  The team consists of a good mix of well established senior researchers and young junior researchers. Strong mentoring at several levels is an important component of this project. First, there is  strong training of graduate students, in these exciting new research areas, with the goal of giving them the background, and skills needed to start their own research careers. Second, there is strong mentoring of the junior researchers, by the more experienced members of the research team.  In addition to working closely together on research projects, the junior researchers will learn the skills of advising PhD students, through joint supervision together with the more senior members. The team  continues to disseminate the research results quickly and broadly through collaborative work, academic presentations, and journal publications. Web pages are created to enable quick access to user-friendly and accessible software implementations of new methods as well as technical reports and relevant references."

Based on preliminary work, the carbon dioxide metalworking fluids promise to have less environmental impact as well as improved coolant and lubrication characteristics.  This work will advance the fundamental understanding of supercritical fluids and their solvation properties in uses with bulk and boundary lubricants.  The development of a vegetable oil-in-ScCO2 metalworking fluid to replace the traditional mineral oil-in-water will result in a ""green"" material that is 100% petroleum- and water-free.

This project, funded through the NSFs program on Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) will focus on a promising, multidisciplinary area of materials technology: biomaterials, which are materials (synthetic and natural; solid and sometimes liquid) used in medical devices or in contact with biological systems. While biomaterials represent a huge and rapidly growing economic component of our health care system (estimated at over $100 billion per year worldwide), they also provide an important context for increasing the relevance of materials research careers for students from under-represented groups. We are committed to this premise and have devised a plan for providing logical research connections with real-world issues in minority communities. This connection will allow us to efficiently utilize biomaterials technologies to motivate students from under-represented groups to pursue research careers. The partnership will integrate alliances with local educational institutions, focusing on education and training of minority students, teacher-education, team-based research, and professional development at all levels to result in substantive institutional and infrastructure development. This systematic approach will have an enormous impact by achieving the goals of the PREM in the short term, while guaranteeing an enduring legacy for the NSF investment in the form of an active, multi-faceted, biomaterials education and research program in the state of New Mexico.  The component subprojects will be focused on developing new materials technologies for three areas of medicine that are especially problematic in minority populations: infectious diseases (inexpensive detection and diagnosis), cardiovascular diseases (tissue engineering approaches to small diameter vascular grafts and heart valves) and cancer (cost effective, individualized, genomic sequencing for diagnosis and prognosis). In each research project, multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional teams will be assembled to synergistically maximize research and training efforts while taking full advantage of the spectrum of state-of-the-art facilities available at Harvard and UNM.  This project will have an immediate impact on the education of minority students by partnering APS, an urban school district with a large minority population, SIPI, a tribal college with an emphasis in science, technology, engineering and math education, UNM, a Hispanic Serving Research University, and Harvard University. We will work closely with a number of minority focused science and engineering organizations to both facilitate outreach activities with APS and to recruit talented students from UNM, SIPI and APS to participate in our research projects. Partnering with Harvard provides important access to enabling expertise and equipment to facilitate biomaterials research and education development in New Mexico. Students will benefit from this partnership with Harvard by gaining access to team-based research experiences, new course offerings, networks of research professionals, professional development resources, and community outreach experience. This combination of activities will be particularly well suited for encouraging our students to strive for the highest level of research and educational careers, especially in academia. We will actively promote materials research and education as an important and relevant emergent career field, and will track the number of students that ultimately make research and education their career choices. Critically, this project, by supporting the career development of several new faculty at UNM, will enable us to institutionalize biomaterials research and education as a pillar of the first significant biomedical engineering educational program in the state of New Mexico. Success with this program will not only benefit all of the institutions involved but will have the potential to positively impact the diversity of the nations human resource pool in materials science for many years to come. The partnership will establish an exemplary tradition in minority materials education and is a logical step in enhancing the educational research infrastructure in the state of New Mexico, while allowing us to become competitive for the highest level of NSF support."

Today hybrid systems are found in sophisticated embedded controllers used in the airplane industry, but also in medical devices that monitor serious health conditions. As hybrid systems are often part of devices operating in safety-critical situations, the verification of their safety properties becomes increasingly important. A hybrid system is considered safe if it is not possible for the system during its evolution to enter an unsafe state starting from an initial safe state. This project develops modeling algorithms and analysis techniques for the verification of safety properties of hybrid systems. Its main goal is the design and implementation of a probabilistically complete framework for computing trajectories that take the system from a safe to an unsafe state, or witness trajectories. Existence of a witness trajectory indicates that the hybrid system is not safe. When a witness trajectory is not found, the repeated application of the proposed methodology can increase the user's confidence in the safety of the system. Since hybrid systems have discrete and continuous aspects of control, a witness trajectory consists of one or more continuous parts interleaved with discrete transitions. This project blends in a novel way search methods for continuous spaces inspired by research in robot motion planning, with search techniques for discrete spaces and formal tools. The problem addressed is of central importance for the creation of high-confidence hybrid and embedded systems with reliability guarantees."

This project will examine the impact of these tort reforms on births in the U.S.  Data on millions of individual births from 1986 to 2005 from the national vital statistics system will be used to determine whether tort reform affects various types of procedures that are performed and the health outcomes of infants.  A national data set on medical malpractice awards will also be used to determine whether there are any changes in the number or outcomes of lawsuits.    This study offers a number of contributions to the existing literature on tort reform.  First, there is very little previous research on the effects of tort reform on health outcomes.  In a famous paper, Kessler and McClellan (1996) show using summary measures of tort reform that these reforms were associated with decreases in the number of procedures performed on elderly heart attack patients, with no apparent increase in the number of deaths or complications. There is however, no evidence of effects on procedure use or health outcomes outside this group.  Infants are a very important group to study, and since there are approximately four million births each year, even small changes in procedure use or outcomes may have large consequences.  This study informs our knowledge of the health effects of tort reform by studying this important group.  Second, many previous studies examine only one or two types of tort reform (usually caps) or use a summary measure. This study develops the theoretical implications of different types of tort reforms and examines the separate effects of these different reforms.  In addition, the use of continuous measures of caps rather than relying solely on zero-one indicators is investigated.  Third, tort reform may have different effects on different groups by encouraging doctors to take more care with some patients than with others.  This study examines the effects of tort reform separately for different demographic groups.  Also, it is possible to identify women who are at high risk of negative outcomes a priori, and the way that tort reform affects treatment of these groups is determined.    Broader Impacts:  This research will inform the ongoing debate over tort reform, and the desirability of federal intervention in this area.  It will be particularly useful to examine the effects of different types of tort reforms, as some of them may achieve the goals of reform at less cost than others.  Also, some reforms may have more equitable impacts than others.  This work will contribute to the literature on the way that doctors respond to incentives, and about the broader determinants of infant health outcomes.  Finally, this project will help to train the graduate student who will be an integral part of the project."

Such incidents (e.g., a major accident, a terrorist bombing, or a natural disaster) may cause a significant number of injuries creating a sudden jump in demand for medical resources such as operating rooms, ambulances, X-ray machines, etc. As a result, these medical resources become seriously overwhelmed, and thus their effective use becomes extremely important for the success of the entire emergency response effort. One basic question is how these resources should be allocated to the patients in need of treatment so as to do the greatest good for the greatest number. In this research, we will build mathematical models to identify key characteristics of effective patient triage and prioritization decisions that will help develop better policies that can be used on the field. We will particularly focus on giving informed prioritization decisions that take into account various factors such as the number of patients in different classes with different health conditions and treatment requirements.    The project will consist of three main stages. In the first stage, we will study the most commonly applied triage procedure that classifies patients only once during the response effort. Using a dynamic programming formulation, an analytical characterization of the critical patient will be obtained and near-optimal prioritization policies that consider the patient mix will be developed. The second stage of the project will be on dynamic triage procedures under which patients are reevaluated periodically throughout the response effort. The potential benefits of dynamic triage will be investigated and good policies for its implementation will be proposed. Finally, in the third stage, an extensive simulation study will be carried out to test the basic principles and policies that are proposed in the first two stages of the project, in more realistic settings."

This proposal applies the technology which has been so successful for making computer chips for the purpose of creating a new liquid Nanocalorimeter instruments for biological research.  Understanding the underlying basic properties of proteins is fundamental to understanding their function.  The high rates of the liquid Nanocalorimeter will allow researchers to observe the fast intermediate steps of protein folding.  The design of this device will also enable the development of 100's of these devices on a single wafer of silicon.  This Lab on a Chip configuration, which is ideal for automation, is a necessity for combinatorial studies.  The extremely small sample sizes are also much needed for characterization for the synthesis of new proteins which are usually made at limited quantities.   This research will provide a broad education for graduates students giving them practical hands-on experience in designing and fabricating devices of the future.  The project also has broad technical impact in broadening the instrumentation for chemists and biologists.  Advances in protein research directly impact the nation's health and medical industry, the most expanding segment of the economy.  This research is important because it helps provide the infrastructure for protein discoveries.  Synthesizing new types of protein is critical for advances in medicine and characterizing these new proteins is the first step in realizing their potential."

In forensics and other areas, however, it may be unlikely for the results of one lab to be challenged by any other lab.  In this research project, the investigators will study alternative network structures for lab-based social processes.  They will conduct experiments with human subjects, constructing alternative network structures in the lab and comparing their performance.  In initial studies, they will compare two basic structures.  In the first, a Sender, who possibly represents a crime lab, will examine evidence and report the result to a Receiver, who represents a judge or jury.  In the second, several labs will examine the same evidence and report their findings.  The investigators expect the second system to have a lower error rate both in the messages sent to the Receiver and in the decisions made by Receivers based on those messages.  The investigators will employ the techniques of economic systems design, which is a branch of experimental economics, but which applies the criterion of veracity rather than efficiency.  Instead of asking ""Does this system produce a more efficient allocation of resources?"", the investigators ask ""Does this system produce a lower rate of errors?""    The project will provide insights of value to fields like medical testing, drug screening, and forensic science.  Better forensic science should mean more justice.  Better medical testing and drug screening should mean improved health and safety.  The problem now is the monopoly element in these fields.  In forensics, for example, only one lab looks at any piece of evidence.  No lab is likely to look at evidence that went first to some other lab.  Monopoly can create bad results, and it can lead to errors.  Josiah Sutton, for example, was convicted of rape by DNA evidence.  This evidence was later shown to be wrong, but Sutton spent four years in jail for a crime he did not commit.  In medical testing and drug screening, too, mistakes create serious problems.  The investigators expect this project to help the creation of backup systems.  In forensics, for example, sometimes more than one lab often should examine the evidence.  The project's experiments should help determine which backup systems are best."

However, the existing econometrics and statistics methods in multivariate time series data analysis are largely confined to multivariate normal or conditional normal framework.  This interdisciplinary collaborative research project will examine the estimation, testing, and empirical applications of broad classes of copula-based semiparametric models for analyzing multivariate data series that exhibit nonlinear co-movements, asymmetric, heavy-tailed, possibly censored and/or other non-normal patterns.  These classes of models will partially solve the ""curse-of-dimensionality"" problem by specifying the marginal distributions nonparametrically (or semiparametrically) and specifying the copula functions that capture the dependence among the multivariate variables parametrically (or semiparametrically). The research will involve novel modifications and applications of several modern statistical methods such as empirical likelihood method, sieve maximum likelihood method, bootstrap method, extreme value theory, residual-based weighted empirical process theory, etc.  Research outputs will include several original papers on estimation and testing of copula-based semiparametric multivariate models for independent data and for censored data, as well as estimation and testing of semiparametric dynamic models for nonlinear and possibly heavy-tailed time series data. The project will produce new estimation and testing software that can be freely downloaded from the authors' web pages.  The results from this project will make significant contributions to econometrics and statistics literature on estimation and testing of semiparametric multivariate models based on copulas, tail copulas, and Garch with heavy tails, and will be very useful in economics (such as industrial organization, income inequality, health economics), insurance, biostatistics, medical science, and other fields where nonlinear dependence is important.     This project will develop new methodologies and apply modern statistical methods to explore nonlinear dependence among multivariate series and to understand complicated dynamics of human and social interactions with empirical applications to economics, insurance, finance, statistics, and other sciences.  Since practitioners in finance and insurance have been combining nonlinear time series models with copulas and/or tail copulas to heuristically model multivariate option pricing, portfolio Value-at-Risk, correlated default and credit risk, and the time-varying asymmetric nonlinear co-movements among different series, the results from this project will guide applied researchers to perform statistically reliable economic policy evaluations, financial forecasts, and risk managements.  The main educational plans are to train PhD students in economics, statistics, and finance to become capable researchers in related topics, and to develop new courses for students in economics, management, statistics, and quantitative finance.

Osteoporosis (age-related bone loss leading to an increased risk of fracture) is a modern problem with significant medical and social implications.

Finally, analysis of archaeological skeletal remains is an important element in reconstructing past behavior and biology, for example, the impact of the agricultural revolution or increasing urbanization on human health and behavior.    The study involves close collaboration between two US investigators and two European investigators from Finland and the Czech Republic.  In addition, a number of other investigators throughout Europe will be involved in the project on a more local basis.

As virtual ""partners"" in interpersonal scenarios, this project implements VHs to augment role-playing and expert-observation for communication skills instruction. Research will be conducted in three stages. First, research will be conducted to effectively characterize a student's VH interaction. This involves tracking the student's primary verbal and non-verbal communication cues (gaze, gesture, posture, words spoken, and audio frequency) and correlating them with medical expert coding of the student-VH interaction. Second, after-action reviews will be developed to visualize the tracked communication cues. Students and instructors will be able to review and replay the student-VH interaction from both the student and the VH's viewpoint. This has the special potential of allowing poor performing students to vicariously experience ""what it was like to talk to themselves."" The after-action reviews will also be used to study VH interactions, understand how people perceive VHs, and provide educators with tools for identifying students that require remediation. Third, student communication with diverse patients will be investigated through analyzing student interactions with VHs of varied ethnic/race, age, and gender backgrounds. Overall, the system will be used to study if the VH's appearance and demeanor impacts behavior, and provide tools for educators to enhance communication skills towards people of varied backgrounds.    With respect to broader impact, this research with virtual humans has the potential to enhance the communication skills curricula of medical, nursing and physician assistant students. Initially, the VH system will be installed at two Southeast medical schools. As part of a communications skills course, students will interact with virtual humans to learn communication and diversity concepts. As the system evolves, presentations at medical simulation conferences will detail how to replicate the VH system at other medical schools and integrate their results into a database of VH interactions. Prior research has indicated that the majority of students reported that they would practice with such a system weekly. Integration into the medical school curricula has the potential to impact thousands of health care students and educators. The focus on communication skills with diverse patients has the potential to improve both patient care for under-represented minorities as well as within other domains such as customer service, the military, and law enforcement."

Dynamics of self-assembly and structural transitions in amphiphilic (micro & nano-enclosed shaped) systems play an important role in numerous industrial processes, ranging from rheology of complex polymer fluids to transport in biological cells. Theoretical and computational modeling of these processes is extremely challenging due to the large span of length- and time-scales involved. The goal of this research project is to develop a multi-scale approach to investigation of dynamics of self-assembled structures. This goal will be accomplished through reduction of molecular-level models to stochastic models for dynamics of few relevant degrees of freedom (reaction coordinates). The developed stochastic description will permit investigation of complex amphiphilic systems over length- and time-scales that are not achievable by molecular dynamics simulations and yet maintain all the information pertinent to a specific process. The parameters for the stochastic models will be obtained from a series of constrained and unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations. Identification of appropriate reaction coordinates will be an important component of the proposed model development. It is anticipated that some of the reaction coordinates (such as a collective mode representing internal micellar microstructure) will play a significant dynamic role in some processes (such as addition of a surfactant to a micelle) while will be negligible and can be approximated by thermal noise in other processes (such as removal of a surfactant from a micelle). The elucidation of relevant reaction coordinates and possible cooperative effects between them will be achieved by examination of time-scales of different modes.    The developed stochastic model will be applied to dynamic processes in several amphiphilic systems of technological and fundamental importance, namely micellar formation and disintegration, coalescence of reverse micelles, formation of dynamic cross-links in solutions of worm-like micelles, and fusion of lipid bilayers. Therefore, the systems to be considered provide examples of both micellar solutions and continuous phases.    Broader Impacts. The fundamental understanding of the structural transitions in self-assembled systems, gained in the course of the project, will have a significant impact on nano-technological applications. For instance, design of efficient processing routes toward nano-structured materials templated by surfactant molecules and development of nano-reactors will be greatly facilitated. In addition, one of the structural transitions studied in this work, fusion of lipid membranes, plays a crucial role in multiple transport processes within biological cells (related to bio-technology applications). An understanding of these processes will have an impact on development of new medical technologies. It is also expected that the stochastic modeling framework developed in this research will find applications in multi-scale modeling of a broad range of complex systems.    Introducing undergraduate and high-school students to research stimulates their interest in pursuing science or engineering career by challenging them at early stages of their educational experience. In addition, introducing the contemporary issues into the undergraduate curriculum will prepare the students for the changing landscape of the chemical engineering profession, including emerging nano- and biotechnologies.    The PT plans to engage in several K-12 outreach activities, namely hosting high-school students in his lab and developing molecular dynamics demonstration materials for the Engineering Fair at the University of Florida. An integrated educational component will be developed that is aimed at teaching principles of molecular dynamics and nanotechnology within the chemical engineering curriculum. The P1 is participating in the development of a course sequence on nanotechnology and its environmental and health impacts. The P1 also plans to maintain strong undergraduate participation in his research program and to actively encourage students from underrepresented minority groups to participate in his research."

The importance and impact of these medical-support-at-a-distance technologies are well documented; what is not well understood is how these are adapted to fit national policies, available infrastructure, regional practices, and local culture. This project will longitudinally track e-medicine initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in Ethiopia and Rwanda. The resulting technology transfer models should inform e-medicine efforts in general.     Telemedicine initiatives have revolutionized medical care for people who live in remote communities traditionally underserved by health services. By allowing medical staff to interact with patients via videoconferencing, collect samples, run tests, and exchange data remotely, they are able to provide a more timely, high-quality level of service than otherwise possible. There is now a growing collection of case studies, documenting the successes and failures of adapting these technologies to particular communities. However, there is limited understanding about the factors that affect these implementations. Through field work, this research will examine a variety of factors (e.g., national policies, available infrastructure, regional medical practices, local culture) that impact specific telemedicine efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in Ethiopia and Rwanda. These are regions with grave medical needs where interest in and funding for telemedicine efforts is increasing rapidly.     This is a five-year longitudinal study to be supported by a CAREER award.

The project explores the computational modeling of fluid-solid interactions from suspensions phenomena obeying simple rules between interacting solids, to flows where key features can be effectively approximated by distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) techniques.  In studying suspensions, the ""sort-and-sweep"" simulation method developed by the PI will be employed and extended to investigate sedimentation instabilities, including some analogous to classic fluid instabilities (e.g., the Rayleigh-Taylor heavy-over-light instability) and others that appear to be special to suspensions (e.g., in electrophoretic levitation and breakup of particle-laden drops).  A main goal is testing macroscopic models of sedimentation processes. Model DLM calculations will be extended to explore important hydrodynamic phenomena at the scale of interaction between small numbers of rigid, jointed, or deformable solids, including investigation of natural and artificial modes of propulsion in liquids at small but non-zero Reynolds numbers.  Research and mentoring activities are bridged in this project through Research Experiences for Undergraduates in networks science, including tools for identifying hierarchical community structures and the application of such tools to novel datasets, including the potential of investigating effective networks of hydrodynamically-interacting components.  The project also includes extensive curriculum development aimed at optimizing the set of mathematical tools covered in courses for undergraduate students majoring in biology and the health sciences.    Continuing advances in capabilities for developing micro- and nano-systems and machines lead to design questions about fluid dynamics at small scales that must be addressed with different tools than those used at large scales.  At small scales viscosity plays an increased role (an air pump doesn't do a good job pumping more viscous maple syrup), and external boundary conditions become more important (the walls of blood vessels).  Also important are interactions between solids and the complex viscoelastic fluids in which they are suspended, a common occurrence in biological situations.  Developing computational tools for more efficiently and effectively handling such interactions is a goal.  Other fundamental fluid-dynamic phenomena are further investigated, both for their own importance and for the validation of the proposed computational approaches to these regimes.  For instance, the investigation of general questions about propulsion of small-scale objects through liquids leads to computational techniques that can be used to study scenarios of potential biological and medical importance."

This model pinniped species has been the focus of three decades of research in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.  Compared to the knowledge of pinniped diving physiology and ecology during early development and young adulthood, little is known about individuals nearing the upper limit of their normal reproductive age range. Evolutionary aging theories predict that elderly diving seals should exhibit senescence. This should be exacerbated by surges in the generation of oxygen free radicals via hypoxia-reoxygenation during breath-hold diving and hunting, which are implicated in age-related damage to cellular mitochondria. Surprisingly, limited observations of non-threatened pinniped populations indicate that senescence does not occur to a level where reproductive output is affected. The ability of pinnipeds to avoid apparent senescence raises two major questions: what specific physiological and morphological changes occur with advancing age in pinnipeds and what subtle adjustments are made by these animals to cope with such changes? This investigation will focus on specific, functional physiological and behavioral changes relating to dive capability with advancing age. The investigators will quantify age-related changes in general health and body condition, combined with fine scale assessments of external and internal ability to do work in the form of diving. Specifically, patterns of oxidative status and oxygen use with age will be examined. The effects of age on muscular function, contractile capacity in vascular smooth muscle, and exercise capacity via exercise performance in skeletal muscle will be examined. Data will be compared between Weddell seals in the peak, and near the end, of their reproductive age range. An assessment will be made of the ability to do external work (i.e. diving) as well as muscle functionality (ability to do internal work). The investigators hypothesize that senescence does occur in Weddell seals at the level of small-scale, proximate physiological effects and performance, but that behavioral plasticity allows for a given degree of compensation. Broader impacts include the training of students and outreach activities including interviews and articles written for the popular media. Photographs and project summaries will be available to the interested public on the project website. This study should also establish diving seals as a novel model for the study of cardiovascular and muscular physiology of aging. Research on Weddell seals could validate this model and thus develop a foundation for similar research on other species. Advancement of the understanding of aging by medical science has been impressive in recent years and the development of new models for the study of aging has tremendous potential benefits to society at large"

Inhorn,  will investigate the interaction of transplantation with the daily lives of adult transplant recipients and their caregivers.  This study focuses on three untested assumptions that: 1) transplantation, as a practice, is both founded upon and affecting cultural norms in the U.S.; 2) kin relations, cultivated in the home through activities of giving care, are a major component of transplantation's impact on daily life; 3) the arenas of constraint created by social stratification figure significantly in interactions between transplantation and human relatedness.  These assumptions will be explored at a major transplant center in the U.S. Midwest that employs a care model which focuses on the use of family and friends to meet patients' care needs both during and after hospitalization.      The researcher will employ a variety of ethnographic and social science research methods, including semistructured, unstructured, genealogical, and life history interviews; participant observation; fieldnote and visual documentation; and review of  health policy documents.  She  builds upon recent kinship theory, which examines multiple forms of relatedness beyond bio-genetic relations.  Comparisons will include: 1) patients and caregivers who are related by ""blood,"" marriage, or adoption, versus those who are ""kin-like,"" but not related in these ways (to understand what constitutes ""relatedness"") and 2) the experiences of transplantation in the hospital, versus those of transplant caregiving in the home (to ascertain the role of the home in kinship and transplant care).  These data will be evaluated in light of constraints faced throughout the transplant process.    The research is important because it  will be useful for  improving  health policy, outcomes for transplant patients (and others with serious, long-term illness),  support for caregivers, and communication between  medical professionals and patient populations.  At a time when alternative forms of relatedness are highly contested (e.g., same-sex marriage and family-making via new reproductive technologies), studies such as this are crucial to understand the mechanisms by which kin relations are created, solidified, questioned, or changed.  The research also will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist."

In this procedure, a tube is manually inserted into the chest cavity by a trained physician.  Effective placement of the tube limits air pressure in the chest, preventing the buildup of life-threatening tension of major organs. Development of an automated tube thoracostomy system would enable field deployment for civilian and military applications.  However, automating the procedure requires advancing our understanding of how to estimate and control forces induced during the tube thoracostomy.    This project will develop an understanding of forces induced by rigid and flexible chest tubes interacting with the chest wall environment during automated insertion procedures.  This basis is key to advancing technologies that will enable autonomous insertion by an integrated self-contained system that incorporates visualization (by ultrasound) for process monitoring, and mechanical insertion by a controlled robotic system.  Methods for feature extraction from ultrasound images will enable guiding/placing rigid and flexible tubes safely into the chest cavity using visual servoing techniques. A control system that can coordinate visualization and actuation to maximize safety and effectiveness of the procedure will be developed.    This project is part of an ongoing collaboration with trauma surgeons at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston) who are working to advance field-deployable systems for emergency medicine.  These systems would be applicable to both civilian and military environments, and would require no special training on the part of the operator/medic.  It is expected that insight gained in this project will impact development of other devices/systems that can accomplish related medical procedures of higher complexity.    Solving the problems posed showcases bridges that can be made to the field of medicine by mechatronics and controls engineering. To advance this cause, a demonstrative teaching module will be developed to illustrate how low-cost vision and software/control solutions can be used by K-12 and undergraduate students to accomplish robotic tasks, particularly to encourage hands-on creativity and experimentation.

The main focus is on fluid systems for  which a unique top-level periodic orbit of pseudo-Anosov type has  been ""built in.""  This work is accomplished using an integrated  program of theoretical, numerical, and experimental research.  In  particular, the investigators (1) advance the rigorous  mathematical theory underlying topological chaos; (2) use the  theory to develop an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms  of mixing in several canonical fluid flows of practical interest;  and (3) leverage these developments to advance current laminar  mixing technology.  The mathematical/theoretical and  numerical/experimental components of this project are mutually  supporting.  The theory provides ideas and a basic framework for  the design and analysis of fluid mixing, while the fluid  applications provide evidence for or against the posed  conjectures and suggest ideas for additional development of the  theory.  The intellectual merit of this work includes its  extensions of the Thurston-Nielsen theory, its contributions to  the fundamental understanding of fluid stirring and the role of  topological methods in global predictions of chaos, and its  detailed analysis of fluid systems of interest for practical  mixing enhancement.         Laminar fluid flow systems are at the center of numerous  major advances in medical, biological, chemical, and material  processing applications that are important for improving human  health, advancing scientific discovery, and maintaining national  security.  Fluid mixing is known to play a significant role in  these applications, and mixing enhancement is most often achieved  through efficient stirring.  Further advances in laminar mixing  enhancement are limited in part by the tools used to model,  analyze, and predict efficient stirring in laminar flows.  A  topological method based on a deep mathematical theory due to  Thurston and Nielsen has recently been applied to fluid stirring  enhancement by the investigators and others with quite dramatic  results.  The mathematical theory, when properly applied,  provides a means to ""design for chaos"" predictively.  The broader  impacts of this work include promoting teaching and learning at  the undergraduate and graduate levels, seeking to broaden the  participation of underrepresented groups in research, enhancing  interaction between the engineering and mathematics communities,  and benefiting society by developing the techniques for mixing  enhancement in laminar flow."

As such, mixed-signal integrated circuits are now part of a broad spectrum of systems, many of which are deployed in mission-critical applications (e.g. avionics, medical equipment) or operate in hazardous environments (e.g. space, industrial operations). Consequently, the reliability of such systems becomes paramount, calling for advanced solutions to monitor their functional health during their operation in the field and to report potential malfunctions. While reliability has been extensively studied and a plethora of Concurrent Error Detection (CED) methods have been developed for digital circuits in the past, there is an alarming lack of pertinent solutions for their analog and RF counterparts. The objective of this project is to fill this void. To this end, its key novelty and uniqueness lies in the amalgamation of state-of-the-art practices in VLSI design and test, with concepts from control theory and pattern recognition, in order to develop CED solutions for analog and RF circuits. In short, this project will facilitate the realization of reliable electronic circuits and systems, thus extending their deployment in a broad range of applications, enabling reliable computing, and fostering technology trustworthiness.

Many embedded systems are now implemented almost entirely on a multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), a single integrated circuit chip containing a complex network of microprocessors.  In high-performance applications, the critical limiter on computation speed is temperature.  Designing MPSoCs is a difficult task because the each application imposes different requirements.      In this project, the PIs plan to develop methods of accurately predicting the impacts of MPSoC design decisions on temperature, functionality, price, and power consumption.  We will also develop methods of automatically designing MPSoCs that are well suited to particular applications.  The planned work will focus on ideas that can be widely re-used in many different MPSoC applications.  An estimate is that system-on-chip market is projected to reach $170 billion by 2007.  The project will hopefully work to encourage industry to adopt the most promising new design and automated design techniques developed in this project by collaborating with our industrial affiliates on design projects and by teaching new design techniques to students who will later join industry."

They desire to live as independently as possible.  But independent lifestyles come with risks, such as debilitating falls and deteriorating health resulting from inadequate care.  To address these issues, researchers are developing ""smart home"" technologies to enhance the safety of residents and monitor their health conditions using sensors and other devices.  In particular, the continuous assessment of physical function is a key indicator of initial decline in health and functional ability.  Identifying and assessing problems while they are still small can provide a window of opportunity for interventions that will alleviate the problem areas before they become catastrophic.  In this project, the PI will lead a multidisciplinary team comprised of researchers in computer science and engineering, nursing, and medical informatics dedicated to developing and evaluating technology to keep older adults functioning at higher levels and living independently.  They will leverage ongoing research at a unique local eldercare facility (TigerPlace) to study vision-based recognition methods for multi-person environments designed to capture continuous and automated assessments of older adults' physical function.  Project objectives include: to collect video data of staged scenarios in realistic multi-person settings using older adult participants, thereby producing a body of labeled data; to utilize the collected labeled data, develop and evaluate algorithms for analyzing video in a way that preserves privacy, extracts the pose sequences of multiple persons, tracks the movement of inanimate objects, and generates assessments and summarizations of the observed activities and physical function; to evaluate the effectiveness of the summarization and assessments by showing the video and extracted information to gerontology experts and obtaining feedback; and to assess the perceptions and attitudes of older adults towards video monitoring by showing them the processed (""anonymized"") video and extracted information.  To achieve these goals, the PI and her team will advance the state of the art in markerless motion capture of human pose and gait, color vision-based object recognition, activity recognition in a home setting, automatic assessment of physical function through passive sensing, and understanding fundamental privacy issues for older adults.    Broader Impacts:  This research will impact technology, health care, policy, quality of life for older adults, and peace of mind for their families.  Advances in technology have implications for other areas, including fitness and physical rehabilitation.  These strides will assist health care providers to identify potential health problems and keep older adults independent longer. This, of course, means happier lives for the older adults and their families.  Offering a model for eldercare technology may also provide policy makers with information to guide decisions about services for older people."

The approach is to use multiple libraries and allow fusion among them in the selection process. Data-driven estimates of model complexities will be used to correct bias incurred by adaptive model selection. New model selection criteria will be developed to allow basis functions in different libraries to compete on an equal footing. The general covariance penalty will be developed for extended linear models. Since model complexities are estimated and incorporated at each step of the selection procedure, the proposed methods are fully adaptive in the sense that they dynamically adjust their strategy to take into account the behavior of the function to be estimated. The proposed procedures are general in the sense that they can be applied to combinations of any generic libraries which may include Fourier, truncated polynomial, spline and wavelet bases. The methods also combine variable selection with basis selection in a semi-parametric model.      Increasingly complex data sets are being collected in many fields. Powerful statistical methods are essential for the extraction of as much information as possible from the data. Advances in computational power have afforded modelers unprecedented opportunities to exploit possible hidden structure using non-parametric and semi-parametric modeling techniques. The novel methodologies developed in this proposal constitute advances in adaptive non-parametric and semi-parametric modeling procedures. The methods and software are quite general which can be applied to a number of different fields including biological sciences, economics, engineering, geological and environmental sciences, information technology, health and medicine, physical sciences, and social sciences. The proposed activities involve training of graduate students for future researchers in statistics. The P.I. is engaged in several collaborations with investigators in the environmental, medical and social sciences.

In particular, the research focuses on biostatistical problems which commonly include missing data, survival data, and longitudinal data analysis. The proposed methodology can effectively transform a high dimensional regression problem to a low dimensional projection, retain full regression information, and impose few or no probabilistic models. There are three components to this research. First, the investigator proposes a family of augmented inverse probability weighted SDR estimators when predictors have missing observations. This new approach allows a more general missing data mechanism than the existing solution and permits more flexible regression forms beyond the homoscedastic linear model. The second component of the research targets SDR for survival data, where the response of time to death or disease recurrence is subject to censoring. Viewing the censored response as a specific type of missing data, the investigator integrates an inverse probability weighted estimation strategy with a variety of SDR methods. Thirdly, the investigator studies a type of longitudinal data where measurements for all the study subjects are collected at the same scheduled time points. Both a population foundation and the associated estimation procedure are developed. All three components center around commonly encountered biostatistical problems and the development of the three components are interrelated.    Modern technologies have pushed the frontier of science with the capability of generating and collecting data in large quantity and high dimensionality. Examples of large high dimensional data sets arise in a great number of research areas, such as environmental studies, human health and medical research, and homeland security. Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) methodology effectively transforms a high dimensional data problem to a low dimensional one. Consequently, SDR allows many existing analytical methods, which used to be hindered by the curse of dimensionality, to now work for the high dimensional problems. In addition, informative visualization of the data often becomes possible after dimension reduction, facilitating both the understanding and the analysis of the data. By developing new theory and methodology for missing, censored, and correlated data, the investigator's research extends the boundary of SDR to biostatistics as well as other disciplines such as econometrics, finance and bioinformatics. The impact of this research is anticipated to be widespread, due to the prevalence of the high dimensional data and the urgent demand for effective analytical tools to tackle those problems."

Many of the classical results for case-control analysis, which assume the covariate distribution to be non-parametric, do not hold under a constrained space of exposure distributions. However, the gain in efficiency of modern retrospective methods comes at the cost of lack of robustness, since large biases are introduced in the retrospective estimates under violation of the gene-environment independence assumption. The main goal of this research proposal is to find natural analytical tools to solve the model specification dilemma of modern retrospective analysis of studies of gene-environment interaction, under some commonly used epidemiological designs. Using the profile-likelihood framework developed by Chatterjee and Carroll (2005, Biometrika), the investigator proposes a Bayesian approach that incorporates uncertainty regarding the assumed constraint of gene-environment independence in a natural data adaptive way. The proposed shrinkage estimator, conceived from a Bayesian standpoint, is designed to maintain attractive efficiency properties, without relying on unverifiable model constraints. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are studied under varying scenarios of gene-environment association. The investigator considers both empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes methods to relax gene-environment independence assumption. The proposal explores the connection of the Bayesian approaches to an alternative random-effects model. The methods are extended beyond the commonly used unmatched case-control study design to two-phase and family-based studies of gene-environment interaction.    Two scientific streams are currently playing extremely important roles in clinical medicine and public health: the molecular biology approach with an emphasis on genetics, and the quantitative approach with an   emphasis on epidemiology. The developments in these areas jointly are making fundamental contributions to the study of etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of complex diseases.  Phenomenal advancement of   medical science and genetic technology is giving rise to many complex design and analysis issues which statisticians and epidemiologists have never confronted before.  This proposal lies in that new interface of human genetics, epidemiology and statistics. Case-control studies are being increasingly used for studying the  association between a disease and a candidate gene.  However, except for some rare diseases, such as Huntington or Tay Sachs disease which may be the result of a deficiency of a single gene product,  most common human diseases have a multifactorial etiology involving complex interplay of many genetic and environmental factors. By identifying and characterizing such complicated gene-environment interactions through clinical and epidemiological studies, one has more opportunities to understand the genesis and etiology of complex diseases and to develop targeted intervention strategies for high-risk individuals. The proposal presents robust and efficient statistical techniques to investigate the synergism between gene and environment in studying complex diseases. The high-performance computing tools developed in the proposal makes it feasible to use the methods in large-scale applications such as genome-wide association studies."

As a significant extension of the classic linear models, quantile regression has growing appeal in survival analysis by offering flexibility in accommodating heterogeneous association as well as direct physical interpretation on event times. Although the foundation of quantile regression has been laid out, many important and challenging statistical issues have not yet been resolved for inferences with time-to-event data: (1) most current methods are derived only for randomly censored data; (2) existing methods for censored quantile regression either require stringent assumptions or involve nonignorable algorithmic complications. In the proposed research, the investigator aims to develop a comprehensive statistical methodology for quantile regression with survival data under various censoring and truncation mechanisms, such as random censoring, left truncation, doubly censoring, and competing risks. The proposed methodological framework will facilitate the development of inferential procedures including hypothesis testing, model diagnostics as well as robust explorations of the varying pattern of covariate effects. The new approaches are expected to preserve the ``computational-ease''  feature of the traditional quantile regression methods for complete data.    The proposed research will have significant impacts and many applications across a variety of fields. For example, applying quantile regression to medical or public health follow-up studies can better inform health professionals of the relationship between predictors, such as treatment or risk factors, and survival outcomes, such as time to morbidity or mortality. The enhanced understanding of variable effects may be effectively used in practice to advance disease treatment or prevention strategies. Applications of the proposed methods can also influence many other aspects of the society, for example, engineering quality control, and economic or social policy making. Results stemming from this project will be integrated with education through graduate level courses and special topic study groups, and will be widely disseminated through publications, conference presentations, internet postings, and free software."

Researchers in computer science, engineering, user-interface design, and telemedicine fields are currently developing technologies for the home that exploit new sensing capabilities to create context-aware environments that can proactively deliver information to occupants wherever and whenever it is appropriate, based on the occupants' activities. Context is detected using inference algorithms that process data from sensors distributed throughout the environment, worn on the body, or both. This community resource will include high-quality, synchronized data streams from most of the sensor types currently being used in activity research (object usage, RFID, wearable accelerometers, video, audio, etc.). It will allow researchers to focus on developing and testing in-home techniques for context-detection, without being stalled by the steep requirements of data collection.    With the resource to be created in this project, researchers will be able to quickly assess the viability of inference algorithms they propose on datasets that capture realistic home behavior, and compare algorithms across different behaviors of interest and sensor modalities. The datasets created through this work will allow researchers to determine the minimal set of sensors required to reliably detect specific activities, thereby making larger scale testing of prototypes in other homes more practical. Rather than requiring months of work to collect data and run a test of an algorithm on data from a home, researchers will be able to quickly try different approaches using the community resource.    This infrastructure will accelerate research on use of information technology to create novel applications in the home, especially those designed to help people stay healthy as they age through medical support and monitoring in the home. The datasets will assist researchers creating context-sensitive user interfaces that are customized to particular individuals and automatically present information at times when it is needed. This work will have application in the fields of user interface design, preventive healthcare, and ubiquitous computing. Researchers studying communication, education, health, work practices, entertainment systems, and energy conservation may all be able to learn how to create easy-to-use and meaningful home technologies from analysis of the datasets this information infrastructure will offer. The freely-available multi-modal datasets of home activity can be used by graduate and undergraduate students interested in developing advanced ubiquitous computing technology for the home."

Such incidents (e.g., a major accident, a terrorist bombing, or a natural disaster) may cause a significant number of injuries creating a sudden jump in demand for medical resources such as operating rooms, ambulances, X-ray machines, etc. As a result, these medical resources become seriously overwhelmed, and thus their effective use becomes extremely important for the success of the entire emergency response effort. One basic question is how these resources should be allocated to the patients in need of treatment so as to do the greatest good for the greatest number. In this research, we will build mathematical models to identify key characteristics of effective patient triage and prioritization decisions that will help develop better policies that can be used on the field. We will particularly focus on giving informed prioritization decisions that take into account various factors such as the number of patients in different classes with different health conditions and treatment requirements.    The project will consist of three main stages. In the first stage, we will study the most commonly applied triage procedure that classifies patients only once during the response effort. Using a dynamic programming formulation, an analytical characterization of the critical patient will be obtained and near-optimal prioritization policies that consider the patient mix will be developed. The second stage of the project will be on dynamic triage procedures under which patients are reevaluated periodically throughout the response effort. The potential benefits of dynamic triage will be investigated and good policies for its implementation will be proposed. Finally, in the third stage, an extensive simulation study will be carried out to test the basic principles and policies that are proposed in the first two stages of the project, in more realistic settings."

The mechanism of taste involves a metabolomic fingerprint of the solution, and in many cases the sense of taste can distinguish subtly different mixtures, as well as differentiate minor differences in chemical structures.  Most tastants, and odorants as well, are identified through a composite of responses from non-specific interactions.  The pattern created by the simultaneous response of a series of differential receptors is specific for a particular set of stimuli. For example, wine tasters are able to distinguish very subtle taste characteristics as a key to the success of their careers.  Our plan is to use wine as a test-bed solution to optimize the art of differential sensing techniques.  The reason for our choice of wine is its complexity and the very unique chemical structures.  Further, wine is an excellent choice because human test panels are available for comparison to our artificial approach.  We propose to target several classes of analytes present in wine: carboxylic acids, sugars, and tannins (and analogs). These classes present interesting challenges for molecular recognition and fingerprinting.  We will use ""in-hand"" receptors for carboxylates and sugars.  Alternatively, the receptors for the tannins will be derived from combinatorial chemistry.  Further, we plan to create specific receptors for those components of wine known to have health advantages: resveratrol and quercetin.  To accomplish our goals, a collaboration has been established between Dr. Eric Anslyn at the University of Texas at Austin and Dr. Hildegarde Heymann at the University of California Davis.  Dr. Anslyn will create the complex organic receptors, the signaling protocols, and apply the appropriate pattern recognition protocols.  Dr. Heymann will use more standard approaches to metabolomic profiling, and will oversee trained human test panels.  The data collected at U.T. and U.C.D. will be used to answer several questions as described herein, a few of which are: 1) How many receptors, and what structures, are needed to accomplish the fingerprinting of our analyte classes? 2) What correlations will we find between fingerprints of the analyte classes created at U.T. and at U.C.D., 3) Will specific chemicals dominate the fingerprints and test panel responses at U.C.D., 4) Will specific chemicals found important to the U.C.D. fingerprints be evident in the U.T. fingerprints, even if we did not train on those specific chemicals, 5) Which chemical fingerprints found at either U.C.D. or U.T. will best reflect the sensory panel input, and 6) Can fingerprints found at U.T. be used in a predictive manner for sensory panel response.  The broad impact of this proposal resides in exploring a general approach that can have impact on the fields of medical, environmental, defense, and food diagnostics.  We feel that the power of an array of synthetic receptors, when coupled with pattern recognition protocols, cannot be surpassed for array sensor applications.  In practice, synthetic receptors suffer interference from similar analytes due to their simplicity. Therefore, synthetic receptors are naturally cross-reactive, the exact attribute that is desired in an array setting. We predict that this attribute of synthetic receptors will allow chemists to use them to analyze solutions for which the components are not exactly known. Furthermore, the use of synthetic combinatorial chemistry in the creation of unnatural receptors naturally compliments this requirement of cross-reactivity.  The ""big-picture"" goal of this proposal is to teach this lesson to supramolecular and analytical chemists, while the choice of wine to prove the techniques leads to a general societal interest and dissemination of the results in non-traditional academic media."

Pandemic strains that emerge from genetic reassortment and recombination may cause a major disaster in the future.  During the 20th century, three influenza pandemics killed millions of people during short outbreak periods.  Recent human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Asia have alerted public health workers, policy makers, and the population as a whole to the possibility of the emergence of a new influenza pandemic in the near future.  This research project will use computational genetics and geographic approaches to build a public, spatially referenced avian influenza virus (AIV) genotype database and will investigate relationships between human-environment factors and AIV evolution.  The investigators' specific objectives are (1) to classify influenza viral genotypes using their genomic sequence data, (2) to construct a public Influenza Genotype-Geographic Database (IGGD), and (3) to analyze the impacts of human-environment ecosystem factors on influenza viral evolution.  This project will generate a systematic description of the spatial and temporal patterns of influenza viral genotypes and enhance basic understanding of ecosystem drivers of influenza viral evolution.  The investigators will use influenza genome sequencing data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The analysis in this project will focus on H5N1 AIV.  The first phase of the project will involve development of a new influenza genotyping algorithm that will further categorize H5N1 AIVs within a public genotype database.  This proposed genotyping algorithm will categorize the genotypes of AIVs by avoiding multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny tree construction.  The new genotypes will be determined by the cluster index for each segment of each virus. The deliverables for this phase include an influenza genotyping algorithm and genotype associated with each AIV isolate. The second phase will involve developing the public IGGD to store and manage the influenza viral genotype information and associated human-environment ecosystem factors. The IGGD will be the first spatial-temporal influenza genotype database of its kind.  It will include genotype information as well as the ecosystems factors that have been hypothesized to be related to AIV evolution.  This database web server will provide an important resource for not only pandemic strain prediction but also future medical geography and molecular epidemiological analysis.  The last phase will analyze the impacts of human-environment ecosystem factors on AIV evolution, including climate, bird migration patterns, human population distributions, farming systems, agricultural output, and land-use and land-cover parameters.  Relationships between the AIV genotype and the ecosystems variables will be analyzed using both a conventional statistics and by building ecological niche models.    The project will develop tools to study AIV evolution and the ecosystems factors in which it is associated.  The ultimate goal of this effort is to enhance basic understanding of human-environment ecosystem drivers of influenza viral evolution.  Most medical geographic studies are conducted at the population level, but this study will include scales from regional-level environmental data to molecular-level genetic information.  The factors that influence the evolution of influenza are not well understood because previous studies have not jointly looked at both human and environmental ecosystem factors.  This study will investigate them simultaneously."

Women on the other hand often live several decades beyond their fertile years and remain vigorous past menopause.  This distinct human longevity is not an artifact of recent human history.  Though life expectancy at birth has nearly doubled in Western countries since the end of the 19th Century, that increase is largely due to reductions in infant and juvenile mortality. Demographic data for historical populations and for tribal and band communities indicate life expectancies less than forty-five years; nevertheless girls in these populations who survived to adulthood usually outlived their fertility.  A third or more of the adult women were past their childbearing years. Comprehensive data on the details of physiological aging in chimpanzees are crucial for an explanation of these differences and the processes involved in the evolution of human longevity.    Quantitative characterization of the aging phenotypes of captive female chimpanzees should be an urgent priority.  Systematic measurement of aging physiology is difficult or impossible in the wild.  The rearing, housing, and health experience of captives differs from the wild, but medical and social records can be used to assess the effects of these features of captivity.  Tissue and record archives allow some measures to be recovered over decades tracking individual heterogeneity in aging trajectories. With the suspension of most captive breeding programs a dozen years ago, the projected size of the next cohort of adults is miniscule.  Measuring changes with age on those now moving through adulthood will exploit a disappearing opportunity to clarify and focus evolutionary questions, and also contribute to successful management of the aging captives themselves.       The project involves the collaboration of researchers who normally work with either humans or chimpanzees but not both, so it will promote the synergies needed to accurately characterize the similarities and differences in aging patterns between these two species.  Student involvement will be emphasized.  In order to reach multiple audiences that can build on project findings, results will be published in journals devoted to research on aging, fertility, primatology, and human evolution.  Since data will be recorded on the same individual chimpanzees, co-variation in various physiological systems will contribute to hypotheses about mechanisms that produce similar variation in women."

In hospitals and clinics, these networks will relieve medical personnel from having to mentally correlate digital displays and paper records. In operating rooms, staff will no longer have to emulate the safety interlocks necessary for a patient?s survival. People once confined to expensive nursing homes, can potentially live longer, more productive and independent lives using these same medical device networks in their own home. To help realize this potential, we need to create the scientific foundation for the safe and easy composition of medical and health management devices.  Much attention has been paid to the optimization of individual QoS requirements and their protocols. Yet, no system is truly functional without multiple protocols working together to achieve a balance of desirable qualities. Our research focus on the scientific foundation for the end-to-end composition of systems, backed by formally verifiable mathematical models, will push software architectures and systems to the next generation of safe and easily-composed medical device networks and other such Cyber-Physical Systems.  QoS aware composition technologies are vital to the mass deployment of modern health care, assisted living, and other medical devices that will improve the quality of medical services, allowing people once confined to expensive nursing homes to live independent and productive lives in their own home. Although this technological foundation will be initially developed in the context of assisted living, we expect that it will be extended to help enable many more applications because QoS aware composition is a generic problem in many Cyber-Physical System application domains."
721155,Chernobyl's Asymptomatic Legacy: Effects of Low Level Prenatal Irradiation on Adult Cognitive Performance,SES,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH|ECONOMICS,15-Sep-07,28-Jul-08,"Almond, Douglas",MA,National Bureau of Economic Research Inc,Continuing grant,Nancy A.

To that end, it exploits the natural experiment generated by the Chernobyl nuclear accident that took place April 26, 1986, in Ukraine. Weather conditions in the accident's immediate aftermath meant that fallout traveled widely. Sweden received about 5 percent of fallout. The project matches adult outcomes of Swedish children born 1983-1988 to localized measures of radiocaesium taken after the accident. Variation in fallout, combined with information on date and place of birth, is used to create treatment and control groups. A study of Swedish children exposed in utero to radiation from Chernobyl fallout provides a unique opportunity to assess potential damage of irradiation at levels hitherto considered safe and/or undetectable.    This project probes the generality of the fetal origins hypothesis. In particular, it seeks to establish whether low-level radiation exposure in utero may shape subsequent cognitive outcomes. Whether these linkages exist is not currently known. Chernobyl represents a compelling natural experiment for assessing these linkages.    Broader Impact Should the preliminary results be confirmed by the full study, these findings would depart from conventional guidelines on what level of radiation exposure is safe. Thus, this work would spur additional analyses of Chernobyl fallout in other countries. Such analyses are feasible, as most of Europe east of the 7th degree east received fallout at levels comparable to Sweden; Some of these counties (e.g., Norway) produce analogous microdatasets of student outcomes. Moreover, this project plans to follow the Swedish cohort born in 1986 as they complete schooling and enter the labor market. This permits more precise assessment of the long-term economic costs of the Chernobyl accident.    Radiation exposure was not restricted to the Chernobyl accident. For example, the amount of radiation released by Chernobyl is substantially less than that released by atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. Thus, low-level radiation exposure is the rule rather than the exception. Chernobyl simply affords a particularly well-identified radiation exposure for benchmarking these effects.  Therefore, this analysis helps inform the costs associated with future radiation exposures. Nuclear power is expanding in the developing world, principally in population-dense India and China. While the probability of a future meltdown can only be a speculation, nuclear power plant failures are only one source of possible exposure to radioactivity.  Others include, but are not limited to the decommissioning of existing power plants, the employment of nuclear weapons or dirty bombs, heightened levels of background radiation at high altitudes (affecting frequent fliers and airline crews), radiation employed in industrial and medical treatments, and irradiation stemming from indoor exposure to radon gas and its decay products. In the event of large-scale future radiation release, this work may inform recommendations to affected populations (e.g., limiting outdoors exposure by those pregnant at the time).    This research may also improve understanding of how fetal health in general affects outcomes later in life. Knowledge of this relationship is essential to the formulation of efficient public policies. In particular, evidence of fetal origins can help identify the optimal timing over the life course of public policies that seek to improve cognitive and related socioeconomic outcomes. Finally, fetal origins provide an alternative perspective on disparities in socioeconomic outcomes. Such disparities, e.g., racial differences in average schooling rates in the U.S., are notoriously difficult to reduce. A fetal origins framework highlights the role of another well-known disparity - the wide gap by races that exists in early childhood health."

Gravlee and Dr. Christopher McCarty will undertake research on the social and cultural influences on racial inequalities in health. Some social scientists view race as a cultural construct, not a biological reality. But this view is coming under increasing scrutiny, as medical researchers seek to explain racial inequalities in health in terms of genetic differences. This development challenges social scientists to clarify how race exists as a social and cultural phenomenon that has force in people's lives and, indeed, one that has biological consequences.     The driving research question is why African Americans suffer disproportionately from hypertension, or chronic high blood pressure.  This problem is a key test case, because it is often attributed to unknown genetic differences between racially defined groups. This project tests the alternative view that social and cultural factors account for the pattern of hypertension among people of African descent. In particular, it seeks to identify the contributions of social structure and the experience of culturally defined stressors to blood pressure variation among African Americans. The study combines (a) ethnography to explore how class and color shape the meaning of everyday social interaction and (b) methods of social network analysis to examine how the social structure in which individuals are embedded shapes exposure to racism and other social stressors. The research will be conducted among African Americans in Tallahassee, FL, a city with a large and socioeconomically diverse African-American community, as well as a history of racial struggle and civil rights activism. The exploratory phase involves participant observation and two rounds of ethnographic interviewing (N = 48 in each round). The explanatory phase will involve a representative survey (N = 350) of adult African Americans in Tallahassee to test the associations between social network characteristics, the experience of culturally defined stressors, and blood pressure variation, above and beyond known risk factors for high blood pressure.    This study contributes an anthropological perspective to national discussions about race and racism. It develops a novel application of social network analysis and builds on efforts to integrate the social and biological sciences. In particular, it will identify the biological consequences of racism and contribute to our understanding of how social and cultural processes become embodied in health."

Ti-30Ta has potential as a highly biocompatible implant alloy with a modulus closer to that of bone (thus mitigating bone shielding), and is potentially less notch-sensitive than standard titanium implant alloys. This project will also demonstrate that advanced powder metallurgy can produce novel titanium alloys that are extremely difficult and prohibitively expensive to produce by other means. Critical material property data of these alloys will be generated that will lead medical device manufacturers to incorporate these alloys into specific devices and to conduct the necessary testing and clinical trials for commercial product release.     The broader impacts from the use of Ti-Ta alloys will enable the development of improved medical devices that will last longer; are less invasive, promote faster patient recovery times and minimize the risk of adverse reactions. Advances in orthopedic and cardiovascular products will also significantly reduce short-term and long-term health care costs associated with such medical conditions and surgical procedures. Ti-Ta materials will also offer advantages for non-biomedical applications, in regard to mechanical properties as well as to shape memory and superelastic properties. For example, such materials can be expected to also offer improved properties such as resistance to corrosion, oxidation and high temperatures. Thus, availability of these alloys will be applicable to a wide variety of industrial, consumer and aerospace products in addition to biomedical applications, resulting in significant commercial potential."

The data will be used to build and test mathematical models to improve our understanding of the genetic structure of populations, the origins of language change, and genetic variation affecting susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and dengue.  Until recently, most studies of human genetics and languages focused on large-scale regional or continental patterns, but all such patterns originate in communities of interacting individuals.  Newly available techniques for more detailed genetic analyses on several chromosomes will be used to investigate the emergence of patterns of genetic relatedness at the community scale.  Genetics, demography, language change, and the spread of diseases are strongly interactive processes.  Language barriers can maintain genetic variation, while the prevalence of diseases such as hepatitis B reflects historic population movements.  Until recently, the entire 240 million population of Indonesia was represented by extremely limited genetic sampling at a handful of sites.  Samples collected for this project will have associated medical, genealogical, linguistic, and sociological data, which together will form a unique anthropological dataset.  New mathematical and computational tools will make possible the analysis of this data on a scale of time and space that previously has not been observed.      This project will support continuing development of novel mathematical and computational methods for the analysis of genetic, demographic, and linguistic processes at the community scale over the last 5,000 years.  The project's focus on community-scale processes and on gene-language co-evolution will define a specific domain of research requiring new computational and analytical tools.  These new tools will enable researchers to both model and infer the effects of demographic processes on genetic patterns and language evolution (e.g. anthropological models of gene/language coevolution, neutral evolution vs. directional selection, drift and variance effects).  Researchers at the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology will collaborate on this project.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for students, and it will result in completion of a half-hour video program, ""Indonesian Origins: genes, languages and cultures,"" with assistance from a leading British television production company.  The researchers also will work with staff at San Francisco's Exploratorium museum of science to create materials for use in both video and exhibit formats.

Some people fuse these brief, still images into steady movement better than others.  Given the widespread need for such fusion, advances leading to even modest gains of function will have a very significant impact. Moreover, some forms of flicker can lead to pathological activity states in the brain, such as photogenic epilepsy. The reasons are unknown, because the fundamental physiology underlying flicker perception is unknown. Although flickering stimuli are visible for only a fraction of the viewing time, they appear as continuous and stable because we perceptually integrate successive flashes in a process called flicker fusion. However, physiological evidence shows that flicker rates above the highest perceived rate of flicker nevertheless generates cortical and subcortical visual responses. Thus flicker fusion caused by integration at the retina cannot be the sole explanation of the phenomenon, and there must be flicker fusion mechanisms later in the visual system of the brain. Moreover, the process underlying flicker fusion may not be temporal integration whatsoever: the mechanistic processes behind flicker fusion are unknown. This gap in knowledge has made it difficult to optimize perceptual stability under flickering conditions. With support from NSF, Dr. Stephen Macknik of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center hopes to discover the mechanistic processes that lead to flicker fusion. The central hypothesis of the study is that flicker fusion is caused by the suppressive interaction of transient neural responses generated by the flickering stimuli themselves, within a lateral inhibition network. By understanding the temporal dynamics of lateral inhibition, we will determine the parameters that maximize flicker fusion and perceptual stability under flickering conditions. The importance of central mechanisms will be assessed with a newly discovered illusion called """"Temporal Fusion.""""  In this, two flashes at an interval of 100 ms (typically easily seen as two flashes) appear to be one long flash if the correct masks are applied to the peripheral visual field.  This highlights the importance both of lateral inhibition and of the need for explanations beyond flicker fusion.    The results of the study potentially affect every person working under fluorescent and/or incandescent artificial lighting, or working with a TV, a monitor, or any cinematic viewing device. Thus the project impacts the entire modern workforce worldwide. These discoveries will serve to drive advances to be disseminated to monitor and lighting manufacturers, as well as to workforce health monitoring organizations such as OSHA, so as to maximize viewing comfort, and thus efficiency in the modern workforce."

The challenging task is to meet the conflicting demands of real-time interactions and accuracy. To generate natural 'feeling' from virtual reality, visual and haptic feedbacks require high refresh rates of 30 and 1000 Hz?C respectively. However, any physically accurate and realistic virtual object modeling is computationally expensive. The goals of this research project are as follows. 1) Development of new algorithms for accurate deformation of non-rigid virtual objects with a large number of vertices in real-time. The new algorithms will improve the Finite Element Method (FEM) which has physically accurate models but needs intensive computation. To meet the requirements of robustness and satisfactory visual results, the proposed model will be built based on a tetrahedral mesh structure. A preprocessing stage will be used to compute a set of elementary deformations of the model to obtain real-time performance. To simulate cutting in the dynamic deformation system, the model will be successively recomputed to remove the tetrahedron at the contacting places with haptics. 2) Simulation of deformable objects in real-time virtual reality applications. Two simulations will be developed: needle insertion into the skin for medical practices; and DNA extraction from agarose and polyacrylamide gels for biological experiments. 3) Testing and evaluating of the deformation to achieve optimal simulations, which will be performed by engineering, biology, and nursing students at Purdue University Calumet (PUC).     The proposed research will improve the fundamental knowledge and enhance the realism and immersion of haptic virtual reality. The applications in this research will benefit medical practices and biological experiments. The simulation data will be used as a basis for developing future projects on virtual reality. The long term goals of the proposed research are to 1) advance the state-of-the-art virtual reality technologies, and 2) broaden the virtual reality applications in multiple areas such as education, health care, and manufacturing, as well as bring improvements in such issues as safety, time, space and equipment, and cost efficiency.

The fundamental hypothesis of this proposal is that ?optoacoustic? technology can revolutionize the imaging performance of ultrasound biomicroscopy systems.  Optical techniques for ultrasound detection can produce broadband, large aperture, and highly populated sensor arrays unattainable with conventional ultrasound technology. The research goals of this career development plan are to (1) develop optoacoustic sensor arrays for high speed data acquisition; and (2) develop optoacoustic-based array scanners for real-time imaging. The proposed research involves device technology, data acquisition techniques, and image reconstruction algorithms.    Broader impacts:   The education and outreach activities will include middle school students, high school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and continuing education professionals. High school and undergraduate students can perform many aspects of the proposed research. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain hands-on experience with a lab component developed for a medical imaging course.  Converting this course to distance-learning format will provide access to continuing education professionals. Web-based remote laboratories will provide world-wide access to instructional experiments on ultrasound imaging and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Encouraging high school students to remotely access the ultrasound imaging equipment will interest them in science and engineering.  Enthusiasm for engineering among middle school students will be fostered through hands-on projects, imaging demos, and tours of the local hospital?s medical imaging facilities. Significant gaps remain in imaging technology as the need for a broader array of techniques has grown tremendously. The potential benefits to society are far-reaching, as effective imaging systems can impact all aspects of human life from the health and safety of individuals to homeland security."

The proposed research may lead to a paradigm shift in the monitoring of respiratory sounds and advance the development of various wearable health monitoring sensors.  The novel air-spaced cantilever structures proposed may enable high-performance and low-cost accelerometers that are highly desirable for many industrial, scientific, civilian and military applications.

In addition to the genome sequence of D. melanogaster, the genome sequences of 11 other Drosophila species have been made publicly available over the past two years.  These genome sequences have brought unprecedented opportunities to study functions of genes and their implications in development and disease.  Gene functions are often inferred from specific perturbation of the genetic makeup of an organism and subsequent analysis of the effects on the organism.  Two powerful methods have been established in the past for such analysis in Drosophila: permanent genetic transformation with transposable genetic elements and transient specific gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi).  Both methods require reliable and rapid injection of DNA and doublestranded RNA (dsRNA), respectively, at the earliest stages of embryonic development.    Within the frame of this NSF CAREER project, two automated, MEMS-based Drosophila embryo injection systems termed 'Search and Inject' and 'Feed and Inject' will be developed to enable high-throughput screens for gene functions in Drosophila embryos.  'Search and Inject' will support RNAi experiments; 'Feed and Inject' will support genetic transformation experiments.  The automated injection technologies will lead to an approximately 20-fold increase in experimental throughput compared to state-of-the-art manual injection procedures.  Development of robust technologies beyond proof of principle will enable their dissemination and widespread use within the Drosophila research community.  The injection systems developed under the NSF CAREER award will be complemented with a system for high-throughput, confocal imaging of Drosophila embryos as well as image analysis software for reliable, automated recognition of phenotypes due to gene silencing.      Application of these new tools will lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of development and disease in humans, with expected significant impact on new therapies and improvement of the state of public health.  The proposed research will advance fundamental engineering knowledge regarding design, fabrication, packaging, and application of MEMS devices.  The generated knowledge can help create systems for automated handling of DNA, RNA, other biochemical reagents, cells, oocytes, embryos, as well as micro- and nanoparticles, with widespread applications in biological research, biotechnology, drug discovery, high-throughput screening, and medical diagnostics.    Educational and outreach activities are designed to interest middle school, high school, and undergraduate students early on in a career in science and to educate a new breed of engineers who can creatively identify and address technological needs in biology and medicine. Outreach activities include a ten-week-long undergraduate summer research program for minority students, a six-week-long summer research program for high school students, and a weekend workshop for middle school students.  Research is also directly integrated in two new, interdisciplinary classes: 'BioMEMS and Biomedical Nanotechnology' and 'Stem Cell Engineering'."

Newborn screening (NBS) is a term used to describe different types of tests for genetic and metabolic disorders that are being performed on all newborns. NBS has been practiced in the U.S. since the early 1960s and in Israel since the 1970s. In recent years, there has been significant variation in the number and types of conditions screened for by public health departments in different states and countries. In 2005, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommended an expanded standardized screening panel including 29 core conditions in all U.S. states. In July 2006, a similarly expanded NBS program was established in Israel.  The expanded panel will start operating by the end of 2007. The long term goal of the NBS Israel program is to screen for all 29 core conditions recommended by ACMG.  American consultants, Israeli public officials, and specialist physicians joined forces in creating and implementing the new program.     This dissertation project explores ethical, social, cultural, and policy processes in the expansion of NBS Israel. Using qualitative research methods including policy analysis, in-depth interviews and participant observation, the study analyzes processes of routinization in a new and extremely powerful technology, Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). Questions about how laboratory staff integrates the use of MS/MS in their work routines, why they set the advanced device to allow for detection of certain conditions but not others, and how they determine and report 'positive' results for conditions of unknown or uncertain clinical significance, will be addressed. In addition, the impact of international, particularly US, influences on the formation of the NBS Israel program are investigated. This research stands to inform scholarship on how ethical issues in science and technology are perceived and acted upon differently in different cultures.  Examination of an expanding NBS program can potentially inform policy-making by identifying opportunities and challenges in the use of emerging technologies with vulnerable populations."

The preceding Phase I project proved the feasibility of developing HunchLab as a set of innovative software tools that scour the historic data of a police department, search for geographic aberrations expected by the theories or 'hunches' put forth by crime analysts, and apply spatial statistics to confirm or deny the supposition. Preventing crime is a more sophisticated task than simply mapping incidents or arrests and deploying resources accordingly. The ability to detect and analyze changes in the geographic patterns of crime and disorder is an innovation in policing which holds the potential to enhance the organizational capacity of police departments across the country. This Phase II project will refine the application and build additional functionality, including alternate workflows for different user types, expanding the alert infrastructure, and building text mining capabilities.    The obvious sector that this product will impact is law enforcement at all levels of government. Additionally the successful outcome will impact federal law enforcement agencies and regional crime analysis consortia. There are roughly 250 municipalities with over 100,000 people in them, and these each have police departments that would find this system of use. The tools will be helping thousands of police officers do their jobs better every day. This efficiency will result in better policing, meaning that criminals will be caught more effectively. Criminals cause damage far in excess of the property and medical costs directly attributable to their activity. Perhaps more importantly, the research will form the basis for other products that operate in realms other than law enforcement. The algorithms and technologies developed in the Phase I prototype are transferable to other datasets that demonstrate similar point pattern processes - events with explicit spatial and temporal attributes. Our Phase I process demonstrated a substantial utility in domains other than law enforcement including fraud detection, real estate, sales and public health. The Phase II work plan includes testing with other data sets to refine that software should address these other markets."

African American babies are more than twice as likely to die as white babies. The primary cause of higher mortality is low birth weight, with black children twice as likely as white children to be born underweight. Despite many studies investigating why low birth weights and infant mortality are so much higher among African American infants than white infants, the causes are not well understood. Group differences in social class and access to healthcare fail to fully explain the racial disparity, which has, in turn, led to a focus on biological explanations. Using a new, uniquely created dataset that allows for a detailed comparison of births across the military and civilian environments, this research evaluates racial disparities in birth outcomes in a way that has not been done before.  As an alternative to the biological approach, the study evaluates birth outcomes in the U.S. military, a natural experiment setting that will provide insight into structural causes of racial disparities in infant health outcomes.  The military is one of the only locations in U.S. society where African Americans not only have equal access to high-quality healthcare, but also where economic, social, and racial inequality is substantially lessened. Previous research has found that many other racial disparities common among the civilian population disappear or even reverse themselves in the military environment. The research examines the hypothesis that in a setting where conditions of racial inequality are considerably lessened, the race gap in poor infant health outcomes will also be considerably lessened, or even disappear.   The study uses a natural experiment design which evaluates racial differences among civilian births compared to military births using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). Using multivariate analyses, the project evaluates whether there are racial disparities in infant mortality, low birth weight, and the incidence of pre-term birth among military mothers as there are among civilian mothers.  The project then studies whether and how the characteristics associated with such birth outcomes vary by race in the civilian context versus the military context. A methodological innovation of the research design is the use of propensity score matching analyses to account for selection effects of individuals into military service.     Research findings have the potential to inform biological theories on race difference in poor infant health outcomes.  If the gap in low birth weight diminishes, as is likely given findings from studies that employ less comprehensive data, any role played by genetics will lessen in relevance, encouraging renewed focus on structural reform.  Findings will also be of immediate relevance to the military and medical community more generally. by shaping the public and professional debate over structural versus genetic factors behind high African American infant mortality and low birth weight. In addition, the medical health of military families is of immediate relevance given that the Pentagon is the largest employer in the U.S., particularly of African Americans.  The project will also contribute a unique dataset to the academic and professional community, providing an important resource for other researchers seeking to examine institutionalized populations."

Yet scholars know next to nothing about how our brothers' keepers make these life-and-death decisions.  This study asks who these surrogate decision makers are and how they have been selected. How do they conceive their role? How do they process complex medical infor-mation? What criteria do they use to make medical decisions and what process do they follow? What ethical challenges do they face? How do these instant fiduciaries comport themselves compared to others in positions of trust? What happens when significant others disagree about the proper course to take? What about when patients have no one to speak on their behalf? What impact do advance directives have? What role do legal statutes and case law play in the vast majority of end-of-life decisions that do not end up in the courts? What role do health care practitioners play in framing and influencing decisions? How do decisions change over the course of hospitalization? What are the different trajectories surrogates take as they negotiate the lives and deaths of those who can no longer speak for themselves?  And how do those trajectories and their outcomes vary by characteristics of patients and surrogates?     The study is set in the neurological intensive care unit of a large urban teaching hospital serving a very demographically diverse body of patients, many of whom are unable to make their own medical decisions.  The study involves the unobtrusive observation of day-to-day interactions between health care providers and patient families, friends, guardians, and significant others as decisions are made to pursue aggressive medical care, withhold or withdraw life support, or donate organs.  The study records the questions the latter ask, the concerns and values they articulate, their statements about the patient, the memories, reasons, and justifications they share, the things they don't say or ask, the disagreements among one another they negotiate, as well as the decisions that they make and remake. In addition, the study provides information on how health care providers interact with these spokespersons for their patients, the conditions under which they confer with them, and how they frame the issues, advise them, and influence the decisions.  Because observational methods are extremely rare in studies of end-of-life decision making, these data are expected to reveal what has remained hidden from previous inquiries, expose some of their biases, and explore the ways in which our understandings or perhaps misunderstandings may have been shaped by problematic research designs.     By chronicling how surrogates decide rather than simply what they decide (as much previous research has done), the data expose how these decision makers act as gatekeepers who facilitate or stand in the way of policies designed to change the way we die and provide insight into why seemingly guaranteed policy interventions have failed and why it is that the ends of our lives often follow such an expensive course.  Research findings may encourage legal policymakers to change or clarify existing law in light of the existing legal standards in order to facilitate decision making at the bedside, improve how clinicians talk with families about end-of-life decisions and empower them as more effective gatekeepers, and help all of us better prepare for the decisions we face or that others will face on our behalf so that we will be well served by our surrogates or at least that those left to advocate for us will have an easier time. This project will yield a book and articles accessible to scholars (in social science, law, medicine, and bioethics), policymakers, and the general public."

Van Tassel, Yale University    Implantable medical devices/materials are becoming commonplace, often playing major roles in life-saving procedures. Medical device infection continues to be a significant unresolved problem. Materials exhibiting antimicrobial behavior represent an attractive solution, but current strategies involving the sustained delivery of anti-infective agents are sub-optimal due to finite quantity of anti-infective, gradually diminishing rate of release, toxicity of released compound, etc. A superior approach would be a material composed of a permanent, non-leachable antimicrobial substance.     The PI and co-PIs propose here to investigate carbon nanotubes (CNT) as potential building blocks for antimicrobial materials. Recently, two of the investigators (LP and ME) have shown CNT to effectively kill bacteria, yet to remain compatible with human cells. These new findings, together with the chemical stability and ease of functionalization typical of carbon nanoscale objects, make CNT potentially attractive as building blocks for antimicrobial materials. However, fundamental knowledge of the CNT antimicrobial effect is currently very limited. For example, the following key fundamental questions remain open:    - How do CNT properties - length, diameter, surface functionalization, metal content - influence their antimicrobial activity?   - How does CNT presentation - as isolated nanotubes, deposited aggregates, thin films - influence their antimicrobial activity?    - By what mechanism(s) do CNT exert antimicrobial activity?     The investigators seek here to answer these questions and thereby take the first steps toward engineering CNT-based antimicrobial materials. The focus is on four model pathogens known to infect biomedical devices, and the team begins the project in a unique position of being able to produce low-defect CNT of precisely controlled diameter.      Materials capable of destroying harmful pathogens without the use of antibiotics or other potentially harmful (bio)chemical agents could revolutionize health care - yielding an immense impact on the quality of human life. One could also imagine other surfaces - within health care facilities or even households - being rendered anti-infective using the strategies developed here. A mechanistic understanding of the cell-nanotube interaction - here developed in the context of microbes but possibly extended in the future to human cells - could also aid in the development of medical applications such as biosensors, drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, and targeting and destruction of cancer cells.     The investigators propose to integrate undergraduate students into the proposed research activities. Students will come from Yale, the University of New Haven, and Albertus Magnus College (all in New Haven). Students from the STARS program at Yale, a program to support undergraduate research for minority and female science/engineering students, are especially sought.     The team also proposes to develop an outreach effort to a New Haven public high school by adding Yale Engineering to an existing partnership between the Yale Schools of Medicine and Nursing and the Hill Regional Career High School. The participating undergraduate students will be encouraged to act as mentors to the high school students.      Integration of research into the Yale undergraduate and graduate curricula will also have a broad impact. The investigators propose to develop a course module on nanotube synthesis and surface coating consisting of a series of lectures to be given as part of existing undergraduate and graduate courses on nano- and bio-materials. The significance will be an early exposure to state-of-the art methods in nanotechnology, as well as stimulating interdisciplinary classroom interaction."

Intellectual merit: Sliding Frequency Modelocking (SFM) is a new technique for generating swept pulses using a unique mechanism to swept operation. A deeper understanding of SFM would greatly enhance our ability to develop a novel swept laser for new applications. This project aims to explore the fundamentals and technologies of SFM through theoretical and experimental investigations.     Broader Impacts: The proposed research promises to make important contributions to the fundamental understanding of swept laser technology and modelocking. It will provides the following: (1) improved theoretical models of modelocked swept lasers, (2) understanding and implementation of traditional modelocking techniques, such as active phase modulation and Kerr lens modelocking in swept lasers, and (3) novel picosecond swept lasers and high-speed Ti:sapphire swept lasers. Mode-locked swept lasers may enable a variety of applications ranging from nonlinear imaging to time-resolved spectroscopy. This project provides an ideal opportunity to educate and train graduate students and research fellows in the highly innovative and collaborative environment at Harvard Medical School. Undergraduate students enrolled in the Harvard-MIT HST summer institute and summer internship will participate in this project. Our group has extensive collaborations with other research groups as well as with industry. Mode-locked swept lasers have a significant potential to become a powerful light source to enable and facilitate a variety of applications, particularly in biomedical imaging to advance health care."

Indeed, HIV/AIDS is affecting nearly every segment of South Africa society, including large and small-scale environmental managers.  Through natural resource management, which includes the everyday tasks of herding and gardening, behavioral modifications due to ill health are helping to inscribe the HIV/AIDS pandemic on the South African landscape.  As the environment changes, so too does the health of the people.  This HIV/AIDS-environment nexus puts the livelihoods of South Africa's poorest and most vulnerable citizens at great risk.  This risk is then situated in a larger spatial and temporal context where local, state, and global actors are responding to today's challenges as a product of the region's environmental and epidemiological histories.  Understanding HIV/AIDS and other health predicaments as environmental health conditions requires scholars and policy makers to broaden their conception of environmental health.  This project pushes the boundaries of environmental health by attempting to understand the relationships between health and nature, as complex concepts that have multiple meanings, with biophysical and ideological components.  Working in this South African context, this project poses three key questions: How are health and nature related?  How have health and nature evolved from the mid-twentieth century to the present?  What is the role of labor (via natural resource management) in connecting health and nature?  A wide variety of methods will be employed to complete this project including qualitative and quantitative analyses from both oral and written sources.  Methods will include the collection of life and oral histories, a historical re-survey, focus groups, landcover change analysis, and archival research.  These methods will gather a large amount of data including qualitative information on local environmental and health changes, scientific reports, policy documents, historical aerial photographs, and longitudinal agricultural and epidemiological data.  These sources will then be combined to provide a complete and nuanced understanding of health and nature in Pholela, KwaZulu-Natal from 1940 to the present.    In order to understand how Pholela's current HIV/AIDS epidemic and landscape are a result of a larger cultural and historical context this project combines information gathered through archival sources, oral histories, and landcover change analysis.  Further, by using a framework of health and nature as not just disease and environment, but as parts of larger social networks and systems of belief, this project will enable a broader understanding of both categories.  To this point scholars and practitioners have tended to focus on straightforward environmental health conditions like malaria.  As a result, the complete relationship between conditions like HIV/AIDS and the environment has seldom, if ever, been addressed.  Sitting at the intersection of environmental history, medical and health and healing history, and political ecology, this project will explore the boundaries of environmental history and political ecology, by incorporating health into analyses of human-environment interactions.  It will also encourage the literature on health and healing in Africa to incorporate biophysical aspects into analyses of socio-cultural context.  To conduct this research the investigators will employ a mixed methodology.  By broadening the idea of environmental health, this study will help scholars and policy makers see physical and ideological connections between the state of the environment in which people live and the health of the people themselves.  This project stands poised to help alter the way both academics and practitioners address health and environmental concerns throughout sub-Saharan Africa.  Finally, because this study stresses spatial and historical perspective, it will offer a way to look at how connections between human and environmental health change over both time and space."

Prior virtual human work has identified that the lowered engagement level of students and the lack of haptics hampered the fidelity and applicability of virtual human experiences. To enhance human-virtual-human experiences, this project will develop and evaluate mixed reality humans.  Mixed reality humans (MRH) in this project will integrate haptics, physical objects, and physiological monitoring to form simulated conversational partners.  MRHs will be evaluated in a series of studies with students in the health profession.  As part of coursework, students will experience a series of Human-MRH interactions.  The impact of MRHs on interpersonal patient scenarios will be evaluated with behavioral, physiological, and self-report measures.    The developed MRHs will be integrated into course work of medical, nursing, and physician assistant students.  These students will be provided new opportunities to practice interpersonal scenarios associated with intimate exams. Intimate exams tend to be high-anxiety interactions, and include exams of the breast, pelvic, and prostate. Improving student communication skills in intimate exams has the potential to directly impact patient care quality and patient outcomes. It is difficult to provide technology-based experience with these exams with existing technologies; thus there is good potential for impact through development and research of MRHs. This technology will also be integrated into a health exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, FL.  The exhibit will have thousands of visitors interacting with virtual human doctors and patients to receive important health information while interacting with and experiencing the affective capabilities of virtual humans."

This project will develop novel methods to more efficiently capture and communicate this activity in environments that currently rely on human observation, verbal communication, and collective memory. More efficient teamwork capture processes will enable both larger-scale collection (which supports retrospective analysis that is critical for improved training and technology design) and contemporaneous collection (which provides real-time feedback to workers to assist in error detection).     To achieve these goals, domain-specific knowledge and probabilistic reasoning will be used to identify patterns of work and communication. The representative domain of trauma resuscitation is ideal for this work since the roles and tasks of players are well-defined and the flow of work follows a general schema regardless of the patient?s injuries. Because of the complexity of this environment, manual tracking of all activities using video recordings requires repeated review and is very time-consuming even for experienced observers. A computer system will be developed that uses video analysis to determine the location of each player, motion analysis to track their movements, and speech recognition targeted at a limited lexicon to identify their communication. Using these inputs, a probabilistic reasoning model will be constructed that correlates data from the environment with a domain-specific model of teamwork. The tagged recording of the resuscitation event will be available in real time during the event as well as post-event for analysis.    The scientific importance of this work is in the need to tag these video observations. Many forms of videos are of repetitive behaviors, whether in surveillance applications, work situations, or other uses. In all such cases, applying a grammar to the video, and matching actions and sounds to that grammar, has the possibility of greatly simplifying work analysis, which is the critical phase in the development computer support for complex, high-risk human activities.    The proposed approach will develop novel algorithms and methods for: (i) person and resource tracking in crowded collaborative environments; (ii) recognition of human activity based on fusion of unreliable data from multimodal sensors and a model of the process being recorded; and (iii) reasoning about human activities at different time scales based on heterogeneous technologies (Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian Nets, and Petri Nets) that mutually interact for activity and event detection. Moreover, the methods will be developed and evaluated in a clinical environment that currently uses limited information technology.    Broader Impacts. This work will also provide the foundation for implementing decision aids in environments such as trauma resuscitation and related medical domains that lack effective methods for instrumented tracking of teamwork.

The Fellow will perform her research at the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of Dr. Frank Furstenberg in the Department of Sociology and Population Studies Center.  Dr Furstenberg is a renowned expert in the areas of family demography, development across the life course, teen pregnancy, and urban neighborhoods.  He has published extensively on the black family and family dynamics in top peer-reviewed journals and is the author of influential books on poor urban families.  Additionally, the Fellow will work with Drs. Samuel Preston, Irma Elo and Jason Schnittker?a group of leading demographers and medical sociologists, also at the University of Pennsylvania, who specialize in black mortality, racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities.  The research combines quantitative, qualitative and  spatial approaches to investigate the relationships among residential segregation, community violence and premature black mortality.  Specifically the study will examine the mediating effects of racial discrimination, family-level social capital, and family processes in contributing to disparities in black-white, violence-related mortality rates.  The Fellow will spend the first postdoctoral year acquiring methodological and substantive training in social demography and population health through auditing courses in the Department of Sociology and possibly the Medical School.  The Fellow will also use the first year to explore some of the quantitative aspects of the project.  For example, she will use publicly available data sets from the National Center for Health Statistics (e.g., National Health Interview Survey) to obtain small area estimations of morbidity and mortality rates for sub-Saharan African and West Indian immigrants.  Other data sets (e.g., the Philadelphia Neighborhood Information System data, census summary tape files, etc.) will also be used to explore some of the mechanisms underlying the residential segregation-community violence-premature mortality nexus.  Last but not least, the Fellow will apply agent-based computational demography and GIS techniques to simulate how racial residential segregation affects features of the physical and social neighborhood environment (e.g., disorder and crime), and in turn, increasing individual agents? risks for morbidity and ultimately, mortality.  In the second year of the postdoctoral fellowship, the Fellow will field a pilot study (most likely in either New York City of Boston) to explore how African American and black immigrant families residing in segregated neighborhoods negotiate their environments with respect to health and safety.  Information about mechanisms from the quantitative analyses in year one will be used as a starting point for understanding how family social processes and social capital influences individual and aggregate risks for morbidity and mortality.  The pilot study will be instrumental in setting up the research design and interview guides for a larger proposed three cities (Boston, New York and D.C.) ethnographic study on residential segregation and morbidity/mortality among black immigrants and African Americans."

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3.   Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.    Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component."

Treatment is most effective in the earliest stages of lameness, however the subjective diagnostic methods currently used by large animal are imprecise and inaccurate. To improve the quality of lameness evaluation, the startup company Equinosis is leversaging research at the University of Missouri to develop a field-ready, portable, wireless body-sensor-based system that can diagnose the affected limb and severity of lameness in horses sooner and more effectively than current methods. This computer-driven technology determines the degree of lameness by measuring the head and pelvic movements of horses. In the proposed project, Equinosis will evaluate the patterns of head and pelvic motions of horses with definite diagnoses of naturally-occurring and experimentally-induced (temporary) lameness. The objective of this work will be to verify both the technology and University of Missouri research data.      The broader impacts of this research may extend beyond the initial goals of improved diagnosis and earlier, more effective treatment of lameness in horses. While Equinosis has identified lameness in horses as its initial commercialization target, the company believes that this patent-pending technology can be extended to detect other ailments in other animal species. Further development of the technology could eventually assist in the diagnosis of medical issues for humans, especially in those cases where the patient has referred pain or cannot communicate symptoms clearly to medical professionals."

The research will extend the performance boundaries of this technology, resulting in a detector for extremely dilute, immuno-magnetically labeled, pathogens.     The broader impacts of this research are based on the importance of early detection of dilute concentration of pathogens and other cells that would permit more timely diagnosis of diseases, thereby enhancing healthcare outcomes. Early detection also reduces costs, as patients recover faster and require less intervention. Blood culture is a workhorse of the diagnostic lab, so there is a demand for a device that substantially improves its performance. Sepsis is a growing public health problem with significant consequences, so the motivation to adopt new tools for the detection and treatment of this condition is strong.

This emerging theory indicates that, when feasible, judicious selection of the type of distortion induced by measurement systems may lead to dramatically improved inverse problem solutions. In particular, when the signal or image of interest is very sparse (i.e., zero-valued at most locations) or highly compressible in some basis, relatively few indirect observations are necessary to reconstruct the most significant non-zero signal components. Compressed sensing theory states that sparse signals can be recovered very accurately with high probability from indirect measurements by solving an appropriate optimization problem. This research aims at the development of significantly more efficient methods for solving compressed sensing minimization problems. A crucial property of the proposed methods is that the algorithms are designed to be ""matrix-free"", i.e., they do not require the storage of (potentially very large) second-derivative matrices. Instead, these methods use matrices only as operators for matrix-vector products.   This research also includes the application of the developed solvers to real large-scale problems from image processing (e.g., coded aperture superresolution, hyperspectral image reconstruction, and compressive video reconstruction), as well as theoretical proofs of convergence and numerical stability of the algorithms.     ""Compressed sensing"" is an emerging field in computational mathematics that aims to improve signal (and image) reconstruction with less data.   More efficient methods for compressed sensing can benefit such fields as medical imaging, astrophysics, biosensing, and geophysical data analysis. The basic theory exploits the fact that many natural signals in science and engineering are ""sparse""--that is, they can be represented as a weighted combination of a small subset of commonly occurring signals. When a signal is sparse, scientists can accurately reconstruct the original signal using a relatively small number of measurements of the original signal. However, in practice finding the right weighted combination of signals can create staggering numerical and computational complexity. This research aims to develop novel optimization methods that can quickly find accurate solutions to these large-scale problems. For example, consider an astronomer wishing to image the night sky, which consists of small, bright stars against a dark background. A conventional digital camera or imaging system would need a very high resolution and sensitive photodetector to effectively localize the different stars, but collecting this large number of pixels can be very costly and energy inefficient. This work allows the astronomer to collect a relatively small number of random projection measurements of the scene and use these to reconstruct the image with a high probability of accuracy. Fast and accurate optimization algorithms for sparse signal reconstruction can impact many other areas of image and signal processing as well, from reducing the dose of CT scans in biomedical imaging and improving image resolution in video surveillance systems for airport security, to more efficiently transmitting communication signals from distant satellites and NASA spacecraft and more carefully monitoring the health of a forest ecosystem using hyperspectral imaging."

The goal is for the system to be trained on sample recordings of the person operating the device correctly, so that later it will be able to detect deviations from the correct operation sequence in the currently performed procedure, and automatically provide corrective feedback to the user, including segments of the video portions that show the appropriate steps.  The project provides a new paradigm for learning by observation that does not require complete understanding of detailed activities in arbitrary visual and sensor sequences, but merely aligns a given new sequence in known context with previously established training data to detect significant deviations. The approach has four components: (1) defining the key states in an operational procedure and the sensors required to best detect and later communicate the proper operation of a portable home medical device; (2) training the system by observing multiple correct operations; (3) observing a new instance of the operation sequence and recognizing that this operation deviates from the training data in a significant way; and (4) providing corrective feedback to the user in the form of audio and video prompts. The research aims to understand the common types of steps required in the operations of home medical devices, map how the critical indicators of these steps can be detected through appropriate sensors, train a system to recognize these steps in the context of a specific human operator, establish a range of required training repetitions for different operational step types and corresponding sensors, and provide a set of suitable interventions to the end user when errors occur.  The experiments will establish the range of training data set sizes for the automated classification of device operations.  The research expects to yield a taxonomy of typical operational steps from an observational perspective for a set of devices such as infusion pumps, and establish the most effective sensors or sensor combinations to detect the successful completion of each type of step. In addition, the work will help find suitable passages in the video portion of the training observations to use as corrective feedback, together with other interactive dialog interventions that may be appropriate for the particular user.       The long-term goal of this research is to develop a cognitive assistance system to learn and represent sequences of steps in the operation of home medical devices through multi-sensor observation and interaction with a human operator. Examples of some of the targeted home healthcare devices are respirators and nebulizers (to help breathing), dialysis machines, infusion pumps, home monitoring devices for blood pulse oxygen, EEG, and ECG. The project will develop a means for home users of these devices to ensure that the correct procedures are followed and accurate operations result. The system provides ongoing feedback to assist users in their device operation by ?watching? the process via different sensing technologies and providing appropriate guidance when required. The target population immediately benefiting from this work would be patients with mild cognitive impairments who would be supported with the automated coach in their use of home medical devices. The growing user base includes elderly people living at home, but requiring support from home medical devices. These medical devices can allow a patient to live independently with minimal assistance, as long as the home medical devices provide the required health support. The end result may be a reduction in errors and in the number of calls for assistance in the operation and maintenance of home medical devices. This will allow people to live independently at home for an average longer period than at present and thereby reduce health care system costs. The research is valuable for medical device companies with respect to device design, verification, and validation processes, offering insights into what sensors and communication devices could be most beneficial for integration into the device itself."

Static media and current computational approaches are not up to the task of capturing highly complex visually based tacit knowledge. A visual knowledge infrastructure based on enhanced computational approaches and robust tools must be developed that can harness the extant wealth of visual-knowledge expertise  and will facilitate the rapid and effective transfer of that knowledge to and use by learners. Five necessary computer science research goals must be reached in order to build such a visual knowledge infrastructure. They include the development of a declarative knowledge module for visual and textual content management, visual mining algorithms for discovering associations in a multi-dimensional feature space, a cognitive model for visual media analysts, a case-based reasoning system for knowledge repositories and acquisition, and a digital library with a robust knowledge exchange framework for interdisciplinary communities. The cognitive model of visual media analysts proposed in the project has the ability to index facts and production rules from associations among low-level visual features and high-level semantics. To make the machine-readable visual knowledge accessible and sharable by novices, the proposed case-based reasoning system  will provide the functions for knowledge retrieval.  An efficient visual-knowledge infrastructure is necessary to meet the needs of high quality and cost-effective basic science research and health care. Other impacts include joint mentoring of interdisciplinary students, and the creation of digital libraries for curriculum design in multidisciplinary training, as well as the engagement of underrepresented high school students and undergraduates in the research."

Previous studies have shown that the urban poor are most vulnerable to extreme heat, but little is known about the interplay between changing urban climates and the coupled human-natural systems that amplify or mitigate climate-related hazards for different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups at finer spatial scales of neighborhoods and households. Taking account of global trends in urban growth and climate change, this project investigates the causes of variation in heat-related human vulnerability within the metropolitan region of Phoenix, Arizona. An ideal laboratory for this research, Phoenix has a naturally hot, arid climate. Rapid urbanization has increased average summer nighttime temperature by five degrees Celsius during the past 50 years. The research will explain the character of complex urban heat ""riskscapes"", assess the vulnerability of people in different neighborhoods to heat-related health hazards, and identify the causes of variation of vulnerability within cities. Ecological, meteorological, sociological, and medical treatment data will be used to build an integrated system dynamics model of vulnerability to climate change that incorporates substantial feedback mechanisms from human adaptations. Researchers will use the model to test hypotheses about complex interactions between human manipulation of the environment and induced climate response, to explore relationships between neighborhood and regional dynamics, and to forecast alternative future scenarios. The results will be used to devise alternative neighborhood landscapes and community coping mechanisms that can reduce vulnerability, and to design programs for teaching and learning about climate and health. Innovative methodological techniques used in this study are developing fine-scale, surface energy balance models for integrating and extending climate research over spatial and temporal scales; combining airborne and satellite remotely sensed data with a meteorological model nested in state-of-the-art global climate model output; conducting spatial analyses of heat riskscapes and heat-related illnesses; and community-participatory research on coping strategies in low-income and minority neighborhoods.    Meeting the challenges of sustainability in a rapidly urbanizing and warming world will depend on decisions that allow humans to control or adapt to rising urban temperatures. This project will identify community and demographic markers of high-risk environments that decision-makers can use to develop spatially informed early warning systems and heat-illness prevention programs. Model projections for the distribution of future heat-related vulnerabilities and human responses that impact particular places and population subgroups are important for cities on several continents because enlarging heat islands, higher temperatures, and associated adverse impacts on health are occurring globally. Model results will be displayed in a visualization environment that will allow stakeholders to examine alternative future vulnerability scenarios; this will make knowledge accessible to the community and promote better decision-making. Educational activities will be designed for low-income and minority populations, including the production of a children's magazine issue on ""people and climate"" that will reach thousands of households.

Scholars have previously explored how state, activists, and medical actors influence the construction of health-related public problems, but there are currently no scholarly models that integrate news professionals? decisions about which issues to cover and how. This project investigates the ways journalists and key stakeholders selectively problematize and respond to health-related issues, by comparing the controversies over female genital cutting (FGC) and male circumcision (MC) as practiced in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, from 1985-2007.  Whether they should be viewed as issues of health, human rights, gender oppression, or religious/cultural identity is hotly debated.  Specifically, this study asks: How does the status of different stakeholders, and alliances among them, affect debate processes and policy outcomes?  What factors influenced stakeholders? framing of the issues and those frames? effectiveness?  How do news media practices shape the coverage of issues, stakeholders, and frames?  In what ways did the broader social/historical context affect these processes?  Three types of data will be gathered and analyzed using grounded theory techniques: materials produced by activist, medical, religious, and other stakeholder groups (e.g., press releases, brochures); accounts from national and regional newspapers and news magazines; and interviews with journalists, editors, activists, medical association leaders and media liaisons, and other key actors.  The intellectual merits of this project include contributions to the research literature on social problems, health and medicine, journalism, and social movements.  The research will shed light on the theoretically important but rarely studied matter of ?failed? domain expansion, whereby activists concerned with one issue attempt to capitalize on the success of a similar, successful issue.  The study also will help to delineate the causes and consequences of defining problems in medical terms (i.e., medicalization).      The project will have a broader impact by expanding knowledge of the ways journalists, activists, state, and medical actors contribute to the construction of health-related public problems and policies.  It will also produce more effective communication among, and public-policy engagement by, journalists and stakeholders; inform ongoing debates around MC and FGC in the three nations while illuminating local politics of gender, race/ethnicity, immigration, and religion; and provide tools for addressing concern about the ?over-medicalization? of society.

This preservation project has resulted in inter-cultural medical research, but sets modern biomedical parameters for confirming the authority of indigenous (Ayurvedic) medical practice. The National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine framed by the Government of India in 2001 produces new terms of legitimacy for Ayurveda at the international level. The policy adapts and appropriates Ayurvedic science in response to demands for international accountability in medical science research, with a simultaneous consciousness to national positioning of the Ayurvedic medical system. This research brings together tools and concepts from science and technology studies and anthropologies of globalization to investigate three questions. First, how does the state narrative of ""preserving culture"" interface with enforcement of international standards of scientific research protocol (e.g., to validate Complementary and Alternative Medicine research in the US)? Secondly, how do two collaborating groups of scientists (biomedical and Ayurvedic) negotiate diverse epistemologies to develop a ""modern"" Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia?  Finally, how do Ayervedic scientists understand ""inter-cultural"" medical research as they seek to emerge as members of the global scientific medical community and full-fledged members of the Indian health care community at the same time? The use of textual and ethnographic methods to explore scientific work in this research permits a focus on a unique stage in medical encounters in a postcolonial society.  This research shifts the focus beyond the incorporation of biomedical knowledge in Ayurvedic clinics to the collaborative development of Ayurvedic knowledge with biomedical scientists in pharmacological laboratories. This dissertation research will add to the few sustained studies investigating the micro-level encounter between two major systems of medical knowledge in India by identifying the laboratory as the formative locus of this encounter. Additionally, this research will situate the evolution of Ayurvedic knowledge as a unique moment in the history of the institutionalization of traditional medical knowledges that ""preserves"" by collaborating across national and global margins. The close observation, participation and description that an ethnographic mode of inquiry brings to this project will analyze not only discourses, but also the scientific practices that may transform Ayurveda's own approach to the body, disease, health and healing."

The reasons for this inactivity are not entirely clear, but misperceptions about the benefits of exercise or a lack of interest are not the primary culprits. Instead, lack of self-control and an inability to commit oneself to exercise appear to play a significant role. As a result, economic incentives, which have been effective in other areas such as education and health care, may be a natural solution.  As a step towards answering this question, the proposed research will study whether direct financial incentives and self-commitment devices for exercise are effective at overcoming these barriers. The direct financial incentives are per-visit payments for exercise, while self-commitment devices allow individuals to define an exercise goal and commit their own money that is forfeited if the goal is not attained.  Specifically, the study examines a) the effectiveness of these two types of incentives during the period in which they are in place, b) whether the incentives lead to lasting increases in physical activity in the post-intervention period, and c) the relative effectiveness of each type of incentive. Furthermore, the study provides an understanding of how the effectiveness of these two categories of incentives relate to an individual?s attributes such as their degree of self-control and their time preferences. The intervention takes place among employees of a Fortune 500 company at an on-site fitness center.  Successful completion of a pilot study at this company in the fall of 2007 aided in the design of the proposed study and demonstrated its overall feasibility    This research will be the most comprehensive study to date on incentives and commitments for exercise.  Moreover, this research will be a useful complement to the existing literature on incentives in environments where individuals exhibit a lack of self-control (e.g., smoking and weight-loss). There is increasing interest among corporations and policy makers in incentive schemes to improve health and reduce healthcare spending. Within the academic literature, the study of per-use incentives for exercise contributes to the broader literature on the effect of financial incentives, including those on grades, school attainment, teacher performance, and healthcare quality. The contrast of self-commitment devices to the per-use incentives will make a significant addition to the growing literature on the economics of self control and will contribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of self-commitment devices in other settings besides the previously-studied savings and smoking environments. While there is a sizeable theoretical literature providing insights into self-control problems and possible mechanisms to overcome these problems, to date only a few studies have tested these theoretical predictions or implemented mechanisms to overcome self-control problems in field settings.    The proposed study exploits the use of a randomized-controlled trial. In such a setting, it can be insured that differences between groups are due to the intervention itself. Much of the existing evidence on the effectiveness of financial incentives for exercise is plagued by research designs where observed differences may be due to inherent differences in comparison groups (e.g., a contrast of voluntary participants and non-participants).    Broader Impacts:  The results of the proposed research will help improve the design of wellness plans and healthcare policies, which is extremely important given the rapid increases in healthcare spending in the U.S. We anticipate that corporations, insurance companies, medical professionals, and policymakers, in addition to the academic community, will all have interest in the results of this study. Also, the research will be useful for understanding self-control and psychological barriers outside of the domain of exercise."

High quality data (e.g., complex data concerning natural hazards, health treatments, and financial options) are increasingly available to experts and the public. To a degree never before possible, individuals are in a position to understand risks, and, in the process, increase control over their lives. Policy makers and others generally assume that, if provided appropriate numbers, people will understand and use them, but having access to information is only the first step to making good decisions.  Individuals may lack the skills, knowledge, or motivation to access credible sources, process information, and make informed choices. As a result, the same data may not be understood or used in the same way by all users. Previous research, in fact, has shown that individuals low and high in numeracy (abilities with mathematical and probabilistic concepts) rely on different sources of information in decision making, and that those lower in numeracy comprehend less and may make poorer decisions when numbers are involved. Numbers are used (and not used) in some surprising ways in decision making. Using behavioral methods (including reaction time, judgment, and choice) modified from previous literatures, this project involves conduct of experiments to test the relations between numeracy and intuitive representations of numbers and to test their separable influences in a variety of decision contexts.     This research may add substantially to our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying decisions that involve numeric information. It will also add to the growing body of knowledge concerning how intuitive and deliberative ways of thinking interact and influence how numeric information is processed in decision making."

New kinds of global actors, termed medical tourists and medical refugees, are the focus of increased attention, concern, and optimism.  These travelers, ranging from the poor to affluent, desperate to dissatisfied, traverse multiple biopolitical borders in search of biomedical therapeutics for themselves or to supply organs for others. While such processes have become a critical component of global mobility and contemporary biopolitics, they are an under-analyzed aspect of migration studies and social scientific research.      This workshop explores the conditions of these global quests for biomedical therapeutics or ""medical migrations.""  The organizers have convened twelve scholars, whose research tracks global flows of medical migrants, in the first systematic investigation to ask: what do these transnational movements reveal about the contemporary conditions and consequences of the global biopolitics of beauty, health, and life?  The workshop is guided by three specific aims: (1) to develop and refine the analytic category of medical migration; (2) to develop a tool-kit of comprehensive and cutting-edge concepts and methods for anthropological research into the global flows of people, capital, technologies, and discourses, which circulate in the name of health and life; and (3) to disseminate the participant's collective work by publishing an edited volume on the topic of medical migrations intended to reach both a popular and an academic audience."

Although there are many accounts of the Bravo event, and some scholarly discussions of its aftermath, there is no full-fledged historical study of the Bravo Medical Program. Yet, this program was unique within the boundaries of American science in its effort to understand the long-term effects of radioactive fallout exposure from a nuclear test. The proposed project addresses this important historical episode, analyzing how the citizens of the Marshall Islands were studied as a major source of information about human radiation exposure for more than 50 years. The Program provided medical care for the exposed as well as produced data that were meant to establish the biological effects of radiation exposure, and which might be applied to radiation safety programs internationally.     Intellectual Merits: The central goal of this project is to tell the story of the Bravo Medical Program, and to analyze how the knowledge produced was used in the development of national and international radiation safety standards and policies, as well as in later debates over dose reconstruction and compensation claims. In particular, the project seeks to answer the following questions: 1) What did the scientists involved expect to achieve through the Bravo Medical Program and how were their expectations linked to the development of international radiation safety policies and standards? 2) How were doses reconstructed and how has the continued uncertainty of radiation science contributed to ongoing debates about compensation? 3) How did the Marshallese and other parties outside the national laboratories make use of the scientific evidence? 4) Why did the Marshallese come to claim that they had been treated like ""human guinea pigs""? These are historical questions, which we plan to answer through historical analysis.     Broader Impact: The Bravo debate is not over. On-going compensation claims rest in part on the concept of ""changed circumstances,"" which provides for a renegotiation of compensation if new evidence emerges suggesting that knowledge about environmental or medical conditions have changed. How and why has the knowledge changed? Why does the scientific information remain contested more than 50 years later? The Bravo Medical Program also provides a window through which to view broader questions about the contestation of scientific knowledge. How and why do scientific claims get contested? How can contestation be extended for long periods of time, even after many of the players have died? These questions have a broad relevance in a variety of environmental and healthy policy debates such as the safety of nuclear power, the reality and severity of global warming, and the risks and benefits of use of genetically modified organisms. This project offers an opportunity to approach broad questions of scientific uncertainty in relation to health and environmental policy, and to address the question of why scientific closure has often proven so difficult to obtain in these domains."

To date no organization has been successful in producing an FDA-approved non-invasive glucometer, i.e. one that provides a level of sensitivity and selectivity equivalent to the current self-test method (deposition of a blood droplet on a test strip). The primary difficulty in building an accurate instrument has been the reliable discrimination of the weak glucose signature from interfering effects inherent in live human tissue. Newton Photonics (NP) has developed a new approach based on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Researchers have previously demonstrated that OCT could detect a person's glucose level. Unfortunately, the considerable influence of physiological effects, especially those of cell size, tissue hydration and tissue non-uniformity, have limited the practical application of this modality. NP integrates OCT sensing with thermal modulation of the skin and new noise reduction techniques to overcome this critical deficiency. In Phase I, NP demonstrated the principles of operation in experiments using phantoms and ex-vivo tissue. In Phase-II NP will upgrade the system for human testing and conduct pre-clinical trials.    NP's non-invasive glucose monitor will improve the lives of millions of individuals whose health depends on the external control of their glucose levels. The NP monitor provides continuous data output. It maintains its measurement accuracy without the frequent calibration required by commercially available subcutaneous probes. These capabilities will enable convenient, pain-free operation. Two groups of users will benefit from this technology: a) hospitals will improve the health and longevity of intensive care patients while simultaneously reducing the cost of healthcare. Approximately 20 million intensive care unit (ICU) patients per year frequently suffer hyperglycemia as a result of major surgery or illness. A 2001 landmark medical study demonstrated that tight glycemic control of ICU patients leads directly to reduced hospital stay duration and also provides a 3-8% decrease in first year post-hospitalization death rate. b) Self-testing diabetics will have a convenient, painless way to more frequently monitor their glucose level and thus control it more accurately. Diabetes is a chronic disease with no cure. The direct cost of treating diabetes and its complications in the US was $92 billion in 2002, approximately 10% of the entire annual cost of the US healthcare system."

However, because of petroleum exploitation, colonization, infrastructure development, urbanization, and land clearing for agriculture and cattle ranching, since 1990, Ecuador has had the highest rate of deforestation in the entire Amazon Basin.  These processes also have led indigenous populations to become increasingly involved in the market economy, with profound economic, health, and cultural implications.      Dr. Flora Lu and Dr. Mark V. Sorensen, both of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will undertake research on the health consequences of increasing integration to the market  among a cross-cultural sample of five native Amazonian populations of northeastern Ecuador.  The research will (1) investigate variation in health, and (2) examine the mechanisms through which market integration influences health through reciprocity networks, mobility, diet, and access to and use of medical care.  The project integrates methodologies from ecological, cultural, and biological anthropology. Research methods to be employed include focus groups, cultural domain analysis, dietary intake interviews, and time allocation studies, as well as anthropometric assessment and biomarkers of current infection, anemia, and vitamin A status.      This project is one of the few cross-cultural and interdisciplinary studies of indigenous economics and health.  It builds on long-term collaborative and comparative research in the region and develops a model based on linking empirical data on market integration with biocultural outcomes. Theoretically, this research furthers understanding of the connections between cultural behavior, socioeconomic context, and health, with implications for biocultural resilience, human behavioral ecology, and life history theory.  The broader impacts of this project will be seen in its relevance to promotion of indigenous well-being, direct public communication to policymakers, and promotion of education and training of Ecuadorian and United States students."

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are both common and lethal in the older population, affecting between 7 and 13 % of older persons (> 60 years), accounting for between 13,000 and 18,000 deaths per year in the US alone, and increasing in diagnostic prevalence as both diagnostic techniques improve and the population ages. Endovascular treatment using covered stainless steel or Nitinol stent-grafts is now the preferred option for AAA treatment. However, current devices are far from perfect, and complications from endovascular repair such as endoleaks, continued growth of the aneurysm, device migration, arterial dissections, and other problems persist at very high (> 25-35%) rates. Most if not all these problems can be traced to the inherent limitations of the materials used in current devices. We propose to continue the highly promising Phase I work with particular focus on four areas: finalize polymer formulation; develop methods to manufacture patient-specific endograft designs; finalize biocompatibility evaluation; and evaluate endografts in acute and chronic animal studies. Anticipated deliverables at the end of the Phase II project are a finalized polymer formulation particularly suitable for endografts, complete ISO 109993 biocompatibility evaluation, methods to manufacture patient-specific endografts, and comprehensive data on the acute and chronic vascular response of the shape memory polymer endografts.     The broader impacts of this work lie in the development of the next generation of medical devices using advanced materials with characteristics that can be customized to the patient. The successful development of useful devices from such technologies should pave the way for a plethora of commercial opportunities including tissue-engineering applications whereby the ""seeds' of new tissues or organs can be incorporated into shape memory polymer devices and delivered using minimally invasive methods into the target site to eventually grow healthy tissue. The ability to fuse shape memory polymer technology with advanced three-dimensional imaging and automated manufacturing methods, such as rapid prototyping and stereo-lithography, promises to open up the exciting prospect of creating patient-specific devices within the operating suite; devices that once manufactured can be compacted in situ into a catheter and delivered immediately into the patient. Lastly, successful completion of the overall project should have immediate impact on a disease that is the 13th leading cause of death in the US, and consequently on human health."

In response to the growing demands for miniaturized non-invasive spectroscopic sensor, there have been many efforts to miniaturize optical spectrometers using various conventional technologies. However they are not yet conducive to both dramatic miniaturization and also high spectral performance at low production cost. Unlike the bulky and expensive conventional diffractive optical devices, the proposed nano-optic device utilizes the wavelength-dependent plasmonic phenomena occurring on metal nanowire surfaces and the gaps between the metal nanowires. This single layered nano-optic filter array is expected to enable a high resolution spectrometer-on-a-chip, overcoming the limits of diffractive optics. This proposal is to design, and fabricate the nano-optic filter array structure using standard wafer processes, to integrate it with a custom designed CMOS detector array to form a spectrometer-on-a-chip. The anticipated outcome of this project are spectrometer-on-a-chip samples for customer test and evaluation, and demonstration of high spectral resolution (10nm) over 380nm ~780nm wavelength range in a compact size, less than 5 mm x 5 mm x 2 mm, at significantly lower cost.     If successful the proposed ultra-compact high-resolution low-cost spectrometer-on-a-chip can be used in various applications such as high-resolution color sensing, multiple gas detection, and mobile/wearable health monitoring. Consumer electronics manufacturers, portable medical device vendors, and wireless sensor node suppliers can be all potential customers. As a key component to these markets, it is anticipated that the total addressable market for the proposed spectrometer-on-a-chip will be over $1 billion in around 2012. Considering the manufacturability of the proposed technology and the readiness of the markets, it is feasible to launch the first commercial product in 2010. The proposed activities will contribute to enhancing color quality and color consistency across consumer color devices, and has potential to contribute to advancing personalized point-of-care, environmental monitoring, and homeland security by enabling non-invasive, high-throughput, low-cost sensing. The proposed activities will provide further solid understanding of the phenomena occurring when a light interacts with nanostructured metal, and enhance the mass production capabilities of nano-structures.

The project uses a new defined differentiation system which allows automation and scale-up production of this important cells. There is a significant demand for these cells from research and drug discovery. Increased availability and batch-to-batch reproducibility of HES cell-derived blood cells, resulting from the defined genetic background of the starting material and this standardized, automated culture system, make this technology invaluable model systems for basic research and drug development. Based on the automated pilot system for handling and scale-up production of HES cells developed in phase I of this SBIR project we will transfer our current culturing protocols into robust automated production procedures to provide a reproducible quality of CD34 positive cells    The broader impacts of this research will be improving the process of drug discovery and development and in the long term by providing revolutionary new applications for medical treatment to improve public health. Nearly 98% of a multi-million dollar stem cell market is currently consumed by blood and immune system treatments. We anticipate that the proposed research will lead to the faster integration of HES cell biology into biomedical research. It will help to provide a variety of other blood cell types in quantities required for basic research, drug development, high throughput screening, biochemical characterization and potential medical treatment of blood related disease."

However, the importance of these plant chemicals, such as phytoestrogens, to human and non-human primate ecology and evolution remains unclear and largely unstudied.  Phytoestrogens, defined as naturally occurring plant compounds similar in function and/or structure to endogenous vertebrate estrogens, are present in the domesticated crop foods of many cultures and have been shown to impact both reproductive and stress physiology in captive rodents and primates.  Yet, little information exists on the prevalence of phytoestrogens in wild plant species and their potential impact on free-ranging, non-human primates.  Because more than 99% of human history has relied on a hunter-gatherer subsistence strategy mainly dependent on wild plant-based foods, investigating the prevalence of phytoestrogens in wild plants is necessary to improve our understanding of human origins.  Furthermore, the nutritional environment in which human ancestors evolved can be best reconstructed by studying living non-human primates in a natural setting, especially East African primates with a plant-based diet.  Since phytoestrogens likely had a significant influence on the evolution of both human and non-human primate physiology and behavior, this project will take a deeper look at the relationship between these plant compounds and the primates ingesting them by examining their role in the physiological ecology of the Uganda red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles).  This will be accomplished by answering three main questions: 1) How prevalent are phytoestrogens in the tropical forest tree community?  2) Does the presence of phytoestrogens influence diet choice in red colobus monkeys?  3) Does the ingestion of phytoestrogens impact stress or sex steroid levels in red colobus individuals?  These questions will be addressed by collecting feeding behavior data and fecal samples from one group of red colobus during a 12-month study in Kibale National Park, Uganda.  Food and non-food plant species will be screened for estrogenic activity via bioassays and HPLC analysis, and steroid hormone content (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol) of fecal samples from 28 individually known adults will be quantified via immunoassays.  Using this data, the relationship between phytoestrogen content of plant items, primate feeding behavior, and steroid hormone levels will be examined.      By combining methodology from the fields of primatology, ecology, endocrinology, and nutritional chemistry, this project will provide information that contributes to a deeper understanding of human and non-human primate biology.  Additional benefits for society include improved knowledge relevant to the public health issue of the effects of phytoestrogen consumption on human welfare.  Discussions of the costs and benefits of phytoestrogen consumption in human diet are currently very popular in the medical literature. Herbal treatments found in drugstores, along with soy and soy-based products, can contain high levels of these compounds.  An accurate understanding of the potential impacts of phytoestrogen consumption on public health will be greatly aided by a Darwinian medical approach."

Its gather data that allows us to (1) monitor and explain trends, changes and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes and examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role of various sub-groups; (2) compare the United States to other societies, by developing cross-national models of human society; and (3) make high quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, and others with minimal cost and waiting.  The GSS is a regular, ongoing interview survey of U.S households.  The mission of the GSS is to make timely high-quality scientifically relevant data available to social science researchers.  Since 1972 the GSS (with NSF support) has conducted 26 in-person, cross-sectional surveys of the adult household population of the U S with approximately 51,000 respondents. GSS content is wide ranging with approximately 5084 variables overall.     The GSS has spurred cross-national research by inspiring other nations to develop data collection programs modeled on the GSS and by joining with the International Social Science Program (ISS). Since 1984 ISSP has grown to 43 nations. The GSSDIRS website is extremely popular with users, having over 4,000,000 visits annually The ISSP website is visited over 200,000 a year. The user community includes researchers, college teachers, university students, business planners, media and public officials. Sociologists, political scientists, economists, statisticians, survey methodologists, anthropologists, geographers, biologists, engineers, psychologists, criminologist, legal scholars, medical/health researchers and business administration and management scholars use GSS data. This use of the GSS is widely documented in publications.     This renewal includes several enhancements, upgrades and innovations to the GSS. Specifically, it will 1) add contextual data to supplement individual-level information to place the individual in a social context; (2) expand our coverage of America's ethnic and cultural diversity by the development of Spanish versions of GSS instruments and conducting interviews in Spanish: (3) fully implement a panel deign to study change among individuals and (4) facilitate the collection of auxiliary data on other social units besides individuals and households and to advance multi-level, multi-contextual analyses.    Broader Impacts     The NDPSS has already had enormous impact beyond the boundaries of the survey itself. The GSS is held as the gold standard by which many other survey data collection activities are measured, and the ISSP program has led to innovations and developments in cross-cultural and cross-national research. The GSS thus serves as a model that is being emulated elsewhere, such as in the recently created European Social Survey program.  This renewal project will pioneer the development of a state-of-the-art Interview-to-Internet archiving and dissemination system that will speed access to the computer-assisted interview data and allow users to access all information associated with each variable in a database via extensive hypertext links.  The contributions of the GSS to the teaching of quantitative social science analysis are unprecedented. Its accessibility and ease of use has added value far beyond the original data collection efforts, and researchers in the social sciences continue to mine the data both old and new to advance knowledge and test theories. The GSS and ISSP program is part of the core infrastructure of social science research in the U.S."

In colonial South Africa the relationship between indigenous and biomedicine was strained as colonial officials regulated how indigenous people could practice medicine. Indigenous healers were limited to using only local natural products, such as herbs, to heal and only white medical doctors could legally use European medicines and treatments; the African use of such tools was banned, and legal divisions developed between ""indigenous"", ""natural"", and ""biomedical"" practice.  Today South African officials debating treatments for HIV similarly argue for the use of ""traditional"" natural materials such as beetroot and garlic to cure illness, raising issues surprisingly familiar to those from the colonial era. This research asks: to what degree do colonial conceptions manifest themselves within current representations and struggles around medicine with the advent of new diseases and treatments such as HIV/AIDS? Specifically, how do the narratives found in South African policy around HIV/AIDS medicines create, reproduce or alter the narratives found in colonial medical policy? How does the use of medicines by practitioners vary from or reflect narratives about indigenous medicine? Using archival data to uncover colonial discourses, plus interviews with current day clinicians, local practitioners, and decision-makers to understand contemporary debates, is to be followed by narrative policy analysis to examine the current policy structure. This research seeks to determine whether and how the current debate is not just about HIV/AIDS and South Africa's treatment policies, but is in part an articulation of set of structured conditions emerging from social history.     Understanding the struggles between biomedicine and indigenous medicine has important implications in South Africa today, where the debate surround the contemporary health crisis of HIV/AIDS, which infects an estimated 29 percent of the adult population. By understanding the social assumptions embedded in the use and regulation of ""indigenous"" treatments, ""natural"" cures, and ""biomedicine"", we can better anticipate and mediate current conflicts in understanding and treating HIV in South Africa.  A clearer understanding of medical policies and discourses, and their historical roots, can be used to uncover biases against effective treatments (whether local or ""western"" biomedical) and this knowledge can be used to devise more effective clinical and education programs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.  In addition, understanding how colonial narratives reassert themselves in current policy and practice can help undo the pernicious idea that those practicing medicine outside of the biomedical norm are doing so merely out of ignorance of modern biomedicine's benefits. Indigenous medicine might instead be viewed as a complex configuration of the traditional as well as the modern, which together may be useful to those suffering from illness, allowing more objective analysis of its limitations and benefits for public health.

It is well documented that biofilm cells are up to 1000 times more tolerant to antibiotics and disinfectants compared to their free-swimming counterparts. Consequently, deleterious biofilms cause serious problems in both industrial (persistent biofouling) and medical (chronic infections) settings. The research objective of this award is to investigate bacteria-surface and biofilm-flow interactions using integrated experimental approaches and mathematical modeling. Surfaces will be engineered with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) presenting different functional groups to guide biofilm formation in different patterns. The surface roughness and flow condition will also be rigorously controlled. The experimental study in such well-defined systems will be integrated with mathematical modeling to obtain critical information about biofilm formation mechanism. These data will help develop new methods to control bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, probe biofilm growth dynamics in a flow field, and investigate the roles of some important genes in biofilm formation.      This research can help address some important challenges such as prevention of persistent biofouling and corrosion in industrial settings, as well as control of medical device-associated infections in health care. The outcome of this study will improve our understanding of biofilm formation and help design better antifouling surfaces. This project will also provide a good opportunity to train students across multiple disciplines, and to recruit and retain young talents (especially the underrepresented groups) in science and engineering careers. The PIs will also create opportunities to get high school students and teachers involved in biofilm-related scientific activities."

In the late 1980s, southwestern Ugandan pastoralist communities experienced dramatic decreases in access to land and water through privatization and conservation policies aimed at promoting economic development. Using the frameworks that were originally proposed within research on natural hazards and the social construction of vulnerability, the two Ugandan policies of land privatization and conservation may be considered to be 'political hazards.' These hazards may have altered aspects of social and biophysical vulnerability by impacting access to resources or altering coping strategies in the pastoralist communities. The ultimate goal of this project is to understand the implications of land privatization and conservation practices for health and vulnerability in the communities experiencing these development projects. By collecting infectious disease incidence data and demographic data, and by conducting semi-structured interviews, an understanding of the incidence and dynamics of health and disease may be fostered. The resulting understanding  faculitates the connections of  specific economic development policies and vulnerability, which may result in an increased risk of infectious disease, expressed as an increased disease incidence rate. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Test the hypothesis that higher vulnerability is associated with increased infectious disease incidence; 2) Test the hypothesis that high vulnerability preceding the political hazards is associated with high vulnerability after these hazards; 3) Identify the self-perceived root causes of social and biophysical vulnerability; and 4) Explore discordant instances of vulnerability and health.    This framework broadens the scope of medical geography to include health, vulnerability and the environment in the context of access to resources and power dynamics. The proposed research will contribute to understanding the potential connections between scales, from national economic development policies and transnational ideologies to diverse health outcomes within communities. In addition, this research will be an important contribution to the science of vulnerability, testing the creation of a vulnerability index. The resulting connections between vulnerability and health may call for new trajectories for development, which facilitate equality and empowerment of people to use available material and social resources to lessen vulnerability and bring sustained improvement in the quality and health of their lives. Examination of the factors that make people and places vulnerable can guide public policy development and improve current efforts to increase access to safe drinking water, reduce mortality associated with environmental infections, and meet the MDGs, while bearing implications for the push to meet those goals through privatization and individualism.

Costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  Increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  Thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the U.S. over the next decade.      One proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (HIT).  These HIT systems, particularly electronic health records (EHR) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improvements in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  Yet simply installing HIT without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. What is needed is an in-depth understanding of how HIT and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care.   This project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the U.S., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of HIT and process design techniques.  The questions we address are: What capabilities does an EHR provide and which are used by health care organizations?  Which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what EHR systems provide?  What are the dynamics of change by which EHR capabilities affect care delivery processes?  How and why do new EHR systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  How do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new EHR systems?  Answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the U.S.    This team will conduct multiple case studies of EHR implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the EHR implementation alters health care delivery processes.  The case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, Fallon Clinic, UMass Memorial Health Care, Canada?s single payer system in British Columbia, and two of Israel?s four Health Fund systems.  These four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.      Improving the quality of health care delivered in the U.S. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  The health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  Simplistic solutions, however, will not work. Solutions require an interdisciplinary approach and the holistic, in-depth understanding of the variety of forces influencing change that will be studied in this project.  The work produced will provide a foundation for a larger community of researchers transforming HIT and process design ideas to solve health care delivery problems."

This will be accomplished through study of a representative sample population exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine ? the largest nuclear disaster caused by an industrial plant malfunction. Previous research on nuclear catastrophes such as Hiroshima, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, have clearly pointed out that the psychological and behavior consequences of these events reverberate in the long term, delving deeply into a community?s life for years after they have been exposed to the nuclear accident itself. Anxiety-ridden survivors lie in wait of dreaded illnesses; inhibit employment, social and outdoor activities; restrict family births fearing congenital malformation; overuse substances; and utilize medical services in far larger proportions than nonexposed fellow countrymen/ women (WHO, 2006; Havenaar et al. 2003; Yamada & Izumi, 2002). For some survivors, these behavioral consequences are further exaggerated by serious mental health disturbance and radiogenic cancers. As yet, it remains unclear how much of the long lasting behavioral consequences of radiation disasters are explained by the radiation dose itself; or by a community?s ?perception? of the potential risk it has been exposed to. Our study team will investigate this question.  The study will conduct a probability sampling of current residents in the Kiev and Zhitomir oblasts (states) of Ukraine. The research team, consisting of a research psychologist, radiation physicist, hazards sociologist and medical consultant, will: (1) reconstruct levels of radiation dose from exposure to Chernobyl radionuclide fallout for each study participant; (2) measure long-term psychosocial and health behavior consequences of the nuclear disaster in the population and (3) endeavor to understand the complex relationships among radiation dose exposure, perceived radiation exposure, and risk projections for illness. Given its unique combination of scientists, it is the first time that individual external radiation dose from a nuclear incident will be so carefully reconstructed for a study focused on human psychosocial behavioral effects.  The findings will also offer more refined multidisciplinary knowledge on the interaction between physical toxic exposure and the perception of  risk ? a bio-psycho-social conundrum in academic research  (Slovic, 2000).   The current study is viewed as having a direct impact on the prevention of adverse psychosocial consequences associated with communities exposed to nuclear accidents. More broadly, the project addresses ramifications of the increasing portent for nuclear disaster events, given the proliferation of nuclear power plants and waste sites; growing capacity of nations to mount nuclear weapons programs; and the potential for political groups to perpetrate radiological terrorism. These concerns for human safety and well-being are paramount at this time. We believe that scientifically derived risk communication and education about these hazards will be powerful tools in mitigating their psychosocial consequences in the global community."

Its specific application is on the evolution of influenza?s hemagglutinin protein, a protein that rapidly evolves to escape host immunity and enables re-infection with influenza. The framework proposes combining models across two distinct scales of organization: the scale of the host population and the scale of the virus?s molecule. The host population component will describe influenza?s outbreak dynamics; the molecular component will describe the genetic changes to the hemagglutinin protein. The proposed statistical developments will allow for a direct comparison between the quantitative predictions arising from the modeling framework and influenza sequence data. The project will apply the framework to influenza evolution in different host species (avian, equine, and swine).  The project?s significance goes well beyond its focus on influenza?s hemagglutinin. First, the proposed framework for influenza?s hemagglutinin can be used as a future basis for incorporating additional complexities of influenza?s viral genome, including the important role of reassortment between viral gene segments for seasonal flu and pandemic flu. Second, the proposed framework will be applicable to other rapidly-evolving viral pathogens, including rotavirus, dengue virus, and HIV. Finally, this project interfaces with several topics of interest in biology today, including how ecological and evolutionary processes interact and how evolutionary patterns can be shaped by genetic constraints.   Broader Impact:   The broader impacts of this project are several. First, an upper-level  undergraduate course with a focus on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases will be developed and taught at the P.I.?s home institution. Second, undergraduate students including members of under-represented minority groups will be recruited for work-study, independent study, and senior thesis research on aims related to this project. These students will learn how to access epidemiological data from biological, medical, and veterinary literature, how to perform phylogenetic analyses, and how to test model-driven predictions. Third, one graduate student and two post-doctoral fellows will be trained as part of this highly interdisciplinary project.  Fourth, a web page will be designed and used as a repository for the model code and simulated data that arise from this project. Finally, results of this project will be presented to the Duke Human Vaccine and Global Health Institutes, which focus on using basic science research findings to inform medical applications."

Biological membranes define cell structure and function, and provide an initial point of contact for cell/nanomaterial interactions.  However, quantifying these interactions and relating them to nanomaterial biocompatibility has proven difficult using in vitro or in vivo studies.  This project will examine thermodynamic and transport properties of lipid bilayers, as model membranes, exposed to engineered nanoparticles. The goal is to determine the effect of nanoparticle composition, size, and surface chemistry on biomembrane stability by elucidating specific bilayer/nanoparticle interactions mechanisms.  Materials of immediate interest include carbon fullerenes, and native or hydrophobically modified alumina, iron oxide, and silver nanoparticles ranging from 5 to 20 nm.  Research will be conducted under four specific aims: (1) Protocols will be developed for examining biomembrane-nanoparticle interactions using model lipid bilayers in the form of vesicles and supported lipid membranes (SLMs, planar).  Complimentary information will be obtained from the two geometries.  (2) Changes in thermodynamic properties, such as phase behavior and melting cooperativity, associated with biomembrane response to nanoparticles will be characterized.  This includes nanoparticles adsorbing within the bilayer (hydrophobic) or at the lipid/water interface (hydrophilic).  (3) The ability of adsorbed nanoparticles to alter the lateral diffusion of lipids within the bilayer, which relates to the dynamic behavior of cell membranes, will be examined. (4) Changes in transmembrane permeability due to bilayer stabilization and/or destabilization with adsorbed nanoparticles will be characterized.    Nanomaterial toxicity has received considerable attention as of late, and this project addresses a specific aspect related to the cell membrane and nanoparticle bioaccumulation.  Understanding such interactions will aid the design of biocompatible nanomaterials.  In addition to publications and presentations, they will disseminate their results on their research website and the NIOSH Nanoparticle Information Library website.  In addition, the new structures formed will provide interesting hybrid liposomal systems that could potentially be used in the medical and pharmaceutical fields.  This project will also serve as an educational tool for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  The PI participates in a summer high school intern program and has been contacted by the New England LSAMP program to mentor students.  These programs target underrepresented students in engineering.  Finally, the concepts behind this project and the results obtained will be used as teaching material in a new interdisciplinary graduate-level Bionanotechnology course offered in the spring semester."

Box 208337,NEW HAVEN,CT,6520,2034322460,SBE,1333|1320,OTHR|0000,,832845,"Threshold crossing models are a standard framework for analyzing binary data in microeconomics, medicine, and elsewhere. For example, analysts often model mortality by imagining latent health status falling below a threshold. A common problem arises when one of the regressors is a dummy endogenous variable, such as a medical procedure that is performed on individuals with the worst unobserved health. Standard methodologies for recovering the average effect of the endogenous variable either depend on the validity of parametric distributional assumptions or require strong properties on an instrument. Instrumental variables analysis recovers the 'Local Average Treatment Effect' but not the average effect.    The PIs propose developing a new non-parametric methodology for evaluating the average effect of a dummy endogenous variable in a threshold crossing model where there is an instrument. Using an early version of this methodology, the PI's have constructed sharp bounds. When all regressors are discrete, the PI's have developed confidence sets that asymptotically contain each point in the bounds with a given specified probability. The PI's will extend their procedures for inference, including to allow for continuous regressors and to consider confidence sets that asymptotically contain the entire identified set with the desired probability. The PI's will develop bounds for other classes of threshold crossing models and limited dependent variable models beyond binary choice models, for example, ordered choice models. The PI's will extend their analysis to consider dummy endogenous regressors in discrete-time, dynamic outcome models.    The analysis is applied to an important medical problem. The placement of Swan-Ganz catheters is an extremely common procedure with over 2 million patients in North America catheterized each year. Doctors debate whether the greater observed mortality of patients receiving Swan-Ganz catheterization can be attributed to catheterization itself, or are due to the unobserved worse health of catheterized patients. In preliminary analysis, the PI's have considered the effect of Swan-Ganz catheterization on later mortality. The proposed theoretical work will allow the PI's to apply statistical inference procedures to account for the dynamic nature of the outcome variable to this situation.    The project is of broad intellectual significance because it advances the theoretical literature on endogenous variables in nonparametric, nonseparable models. Previous approaches require a continuous endogenous regressor, a continuous outcome variable, or particularly strong statistical identification requirements. The research introduces a new approach without the need for any of these objects, which are often not available in empirical settings.    This research program will also have broader impacts outside of theoretical econometrics. The empirical project proposed is important in its own right, and the results will provide doctors with guidance on thorny patient care decisions. The analysis of the effect of binary endogenous variables on limited dependent variables is a common problem in empirical economics, sociology, political science, and medicine; hence, the theoretical work will have wide applicablity."

However, the existing econometrics and statistics methods in multivariate time series data analysis are largely confined to multivariate normal or conditional normal framework.  This interdisciplinary collaborative research project will examine the estimation, testing, and empirical applications of broad classes of copula-based semiparametric models for analyzing multivariate data series that exhibit nonlinear co-movements, asymmetric, heavy-tailed, possibly censored and/or other non-normal patterns.  These classes of models will partially solve the ""curse-of-dimensionality"" problem by specifying the marginal distributions nonparametrically (or semiparametrically) and specifying the copula functions that capture the dependence among the multivariate variables parametrically (or semiparametrically). The research will involve novel modifications and applications of several modern statistical methods such as empirical likelihood method, sieve maximum likelihood method, bootstrap method, extreme value theory, residual-based weighted empirical process theory, etc.  Research outputs will include several original papers on estimation and testing of copula-based semiparametric multivariate models for independent data and for censored data, as well as estimation and testing of semiparametric dynamic models for nonlinear and possibly heavy-tailed time series data. The project will produce new estimation and testing software that can be freely downloaded from the authors' web pages.  The results from this project will make significant contributions to econometrics and statistics literature on estimation and testing of semiparametric multivariate models based on copulas, tail copulas, and Garch with heavy tails, and will be very useful in economics (such as industrial organization, income inequality, health economics), insurance, biostatistics, medical science, and other fields where nonlinear dependence is important.     This project will develop new methodologies and apply modern statistical methods to explore nonlinear dependence among multivariate series and to understand complicated dynamics of human and social interactions with empirical applications to economics, insurance, finance, statistics, and other sciences.  Since practitioners in finance and insurance have been combining nonlinear time series models with copulas and/or tail copulas to heuristically model multivariate option pricing, portfolio Value-at-Risk, correlated default and credit risk, and the time-varying asymmetric nonlinear co-movements among different series, the results from this project will guide applied researchers to perform statistically reliable economic policy evaluations, financial forecasts, and risk managements.

The innovation combines the company?s SiC-based MEMS piezoelectric bimorph microresonator chemical detection technology with a NOx sensor materials technology patented by MIT, to develop a NOx sensor needed for emissions control and capable of operation in harsh engine emissions environments. This will be accomplished by 1) formulating NOx-sensitive material compositions optimized for sensitivity, reversibility and long term stability, 2) developing deposition processes for integrating the NOx sensitive materials onto its MEMS resonators, and 3) developing high temperature compatible electrodes and packaging compatible with hot engine emissions.       If successful the proposed NOx sensor will fill a strategic and unmet need allowing diesel engines to conform to new diesel engine emissions standards being implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), European Union and Japan. The proposed program will develop and demonstrate highly innovative, sensitive and stable MEMS-based resonator sensor suitable for detecting NOx and ultimately other pollutants in high temperature and chemically aggressive engine emissions environments, and will position US industry for a leadership role in engine emissions NOx control. In order to meet these standards, automobile and truck manufacturers have turned to two after-treatment technologies that reduce tailpipe NOx emission levels. Both after-treatment technologies require NOx sensors, to 1) control the after treatment trap-regenerate cycle, and 2) to monitor after-treatment system performance, confirming proper NOx restriction or triggering the ?check engine? indicator. The NOx sensor will allow clean, energy efficient diesel engines to continue to replace gasoline engines, thereby reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions without increasing NOx pollutants. Furthermore, as the NOx sensor and NOx remediation technologies are introduced into diesel automobiles, trucks, locomotives, diesel power generators etc., these systems will become cleaner providing significant value to society in the form of cleaner air, improved health and reduced medical costs."

Changes in land use and the resulting shifts in biological communities have been linked to the emergence of pathogens with medical and veterinary importance.  However, the ecological mechanisms responsible for increases in infection often remain conjectural.  This proposal examines how the ongoing transformation of landscapes surrounding wetlands influences an emerging issue of conservation importance: amphibian limb deformities.  The flatworm parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae, which sequentially infects freshwater snails, larval amphibians, and birds, has been linked to widespread limb deformities in amphibians.  Infection and the resulting malformations also increase amphibian mortality, potentially causing declines in amphibian populations.  Building upon previously funded NSF research and ecological theory, the current proposal combines broad-scale field surveys and mechanistic experiments to understand how land use change, by altering host density and host diversity, will promote or limit Ribeiroia abundance and amphibian malformations.  This effort will specifically seek to identify how biodiversity losses in freshwater ecosystems affect the transmission of pathogenic parasites, such as Ribeiroia.  Considering the growing number of emerging infections that threaten human health and wildlife conservation, results of the proposed efforts have broad application potential. Ribeiroia is not only growing in conservation importance itself, but is an excellent analog for other parasite infections of economic and human-health significance (e.g., human blood flukes). This proposal would further support cooperative efforts among amphibian biologists and ecologists to address ongoing declines in amphibian populations worldwide."

Recent advances in medical treatment have resulted in a longer lifespan for many Americans. At the same time the patient population is growing more complex, with multiple chronic diseases, competing risks of health complications, and medication conflicts. As a result, medical decisions are becoming harder because what helps one patient or condition may harm another. Chronic disease screening and medical treatment decisions combine large state spaces that define patient health characteristics, such as clinical risk factors and medication histories, with uncertainty in future health outcomes due to differences among patients in genetic, environmental, and other factors. Decisions about treatment and screening take place over long periods (sometimes decades) under constraints due to medication conflicts. As a result, the stochastic and sequential decision making process gives rise to computational optimization problems that are often unsolvable with state-of-the-art algorithms and computing resources. However, these problems have promising structural properties that can be exploited to achieve meaningful theoretical insights and computationally tractable stochastic optimization methods.      Advancing the understanding of chronic care delivery has the potential to improve the quality of life for a large and growing proportion of the U.S. population. The translation of discoveries based on this research has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of national screening and treatment policies. Results of this research will be disseminated to the medical community, the engineering research community, and incorporated into educational materials ranging from high school to doctoral studies."

This project will develop a general statistical modeling/computing framework to perform 3D holistic brain image understanding.  The framework emphasizes rigorous, efficient, and effective learning-based statistical models to integrate the complex appearances, varying 3D shapes, and the large spatial configuration of anatomical brain structures.    Implicit models through discriminative approaches have the advantages of fusing a large amount of information and obtaining decisions quickly. Explicit models through generative approaches can directly represent the information and thus, better explain the structure and model the transformation and scale change. The PI explores harmonic relationships between discriminative and generative models for 3D image parsing by combining implicit and explicit models along several directions: (1) learning-based models with rich appearance, and implicit shape and context; (2) integrating skeleton with surfaces for 3D shapes; (3) effective 3D shape representation and similarity measure; (4) component-based simultaneous registration and segmentation.    This research will contribute to automating the process of extracting a large number of anatomical structures, and enhancing the shape analysis needed for detecting brain diseases, monitoring health conditions, studying drug effects, and discovering brain functions. The scope of the proposed model goes beyond medical image analysis and can be applied in other problems of statistical modeling/computing, computer vision, multi-variate labeling in machine learning."

Specific contributions of this work will include the creation of hand-held instruments that accurately capture and re-create the broad-bandwidth experience of natural touch-based interactions with real object surfaces; the construction of a signal-processing pipeline that can use recorded motion data to derive perceptually relevant dynamic models for the tool-contact states of hovering, pressing, and traversing, plus the event-based transitions between these states; the generation of an interactive online database of haptographs for a wide variety of tool-surface pairings; evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed approach to high-fidelity acceleration feedback for virtual environment rendering; and an understanding of the role of the human haptographer in these processes. In the domain of education, the specific contributions of this project will include improvements to the PI?s hands-on engineering mechanics course for first-year engineers; carefully guided involvement of a diverse range of undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed research endeavors; and the development of novel instructional methods and materials for the PI?s new graduate-level class on haptics research.    The planned combination of research and education activities have numerous potential benefits for society and the student community in and around University of Pennsylvania. Particular positive ramifications of establishing the approach of haptography are to allow doctors and dentists to create haptic records of medical afflictions such as a decayed tooth surface to assist in diagnosis and patient health tracking; to improve the realism and consequent training efficacy of haptic surgical simulators and other computer-based education tools; to allow a wide range of people, such as museum goers and online shoppers, to touch realistic virtual copies of valuable items; to facilitate a haptographic approach to low-bandwidth and time-delayed teleoperation, as found in space exploration; and to enable new insights on human and robot touch capabilities."

Capture and access technologies, i.e., ubiquitous computing technologies that enable recording and access to recorded data, are particularly promising for monitoring the effectiveness of interventions for chronic conditions. Health and behavioral data can be captured, analyzed, and mined over time, providing valuable evidence for tracking the progress of interventions. This research will examine the role that novel mobile and ubiquitous computing technologies can play in record-keeping for chronic care of young children.     Specifically, this research addresses three major challenges. First, technological interventions must be developed that support better record keeping and associated visualization and hypothesis testing to allow caregivers to understand the impacts of their pharmaceutical and behavioral interventions. Second, these interventions must be understood in the short-term to support testing of clinical efficacy and also over the lifetime of these patients whose chronic conditions can span several decades. Third, the focus of these technologies must be not only on capturing and allowing access to appropriate data but also in accomplishing these goals while easing the extensive burden on families."

Research and Education Objectives: Balance impairments affect a large population of individuals including the elderly and those with vestibular deficit, peripheral neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. Recognizing this reduced quality of life, the goals of this research are: 1) To design and build a sensory substitution technology platform to augment current balance rehabilitation best practices, 2) To assess the capability of sensory substitution to improve stability during locomotor activities, 3) To evaluate the cognitive workload associated with attending to information provided by a sensory substitution device, 4) To determine the effect of vibrotactile feedback on fall prevention, and 5) To examine whether or not a patient can retain improvements in balance following training with sensory substitution technology. Balance-impaired populations including vestibular, vestibular secondary to traumatic brain injury, stroke, and the elderly will be tested in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Michigan, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Northwestern University, and Walter Reed Army Medical Center. This research proposes to investigate the mechanisms that govern standing and locomotor responses to vibrotactile sensory substitution while emphasizing co-creation with both the prospective patient population and those administering rehabilitation (physical therapists in most cases) throughout the design process. The study and implementation of this co-creation process will be pursued further through an integrated educational program that examines medical device co-creation in a broader context of global health. To this end, the PI will implement a Global Health Design Minor in the University of Michigan's College of Engineering; this minor will include an Immersion Experience in which students travel to the developing world to learn the process of co-creation by working with and directly assessing the needs of end users, followed by a two-course capstone design sequence in which these experiences are translated into medical device designs than can more realistically achieve broader impact.    Intellectual Merit: While prior work by the PI and others has suggested that vibrotactile feedback can significantly improve balance during stance, its application in improving balance during gait remains for the most part unexplored, as does its efficacy as a rehabilitation tool for balance-impaired individuals. A major obstacle standing in the way of its use for these critical applications is the current lack of knowledge regarding the biomechanical parameters best suited for vibrotactile feedback during locomotion. This research will focus on uncovering feedback variables and vibrotactile display strategies that can improve both stability during gait and balance rehabilitation outcomes. For example, the device will have the unique capability to display vibrotactile feedback of gait velocity, stride length, and gaze-three important variables that therapists qualitatively use to correct vestibulopathic gait. The knowledge gained from these studies will be useful not only for vibrotactile feedback but also for the broad range of sensory substitution devices aimed at overcoming balance deficits.  Broader Impacts: Ultimately, it is the goal of this research to provide scientific justification and device development for an ergonomic, affordable, wearable sensory substitution prototype that would enable balance-impaired individuals to perform activities of daily living and improve their quality of life. In a rehabilitation setting, the device has the potential to impact both the rate of recovery of balance function and the extent to which recovery is achieved by providing continuous information about body motion that corroborates verbal and tactile feedback provided by therapists. The broader impacts of the educational plan emphasizing co-creation of medical technologies for global health include the development of affordable medical devices for the U.S. and developing world, the education of undergraduate and graduate students in the necessity of incorporating end-user input during engineering design, and the dissemination of global health issues to a broad audience."

Of particular relevance to this project is that the adjustment of volumetric measurements for lung capacity is routinely made for age, height, gender, and race of the subject.  ""Race correction,"" also referred to as ""ethnic adjustment"" is sanctioned by many professional societies without a full understanding of the limitations of such a practice.    Specific contexts to be studied include military medicine, physical fitness movements, and workmen's compensation systems in three countries: The US, the UK, and South Africa.  This project will draw extensively on the biomedical literature, physiology and medical textbooks, records of consensus conferences on standardization of the technology, personal papers of researchers and archives of governmental committees and spirometry manufacturers. Archival material will be supplemented with personal interviews.    The era of genomics has brought with it renewed concerns about the meanings of race and ethnicity, the role of scientific theories, practices, and technologies in constructing such meanings, and the use of race and ethnicity in scientific investigations.  As complex technologies become ever more central to daily life and the medical marketplace, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which technological instruments have worked across national boundaries to naturalize racial and ethnic categories in the past and how this global history shapes present understandings of lung capacity measurements.  By elucidating the historical process by which social and cultural beliefs about race got attached to spirometry and then built into the machine, this project will illuminate an understudied dimension of the history of technology and contribute to the cotemporary debate on race, genetics, and health."

The project will be conducted in two cities along the United States-Mexico border. Previous studies have illustrated that Americans actively pursue health care opportunities in Mexico, but there is little known about the institutional structures and cultural beliefs that enable or encourage people to do so.     This study examines three questions: 1) Do Americans cross the border for health care predominately because of lack of insurance and high medical cost, or are social and cultural factors also important? 2) What factors determine the way American medical migrants choose providers in Mexico? 3) How do American medical providers balance nationalism and patient safety with their assessment of medical migration? Research will be conducted through the use of surveys, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with the primary participants: patients, doctors, dentists, pharmacists, and medical migration brokers.    This project is important because it examines how culture, as well as poverty, health care inequalities, and state policies influence individual health care options and decisions. Furthermore, it will contribute to the discussion of border health policy and the different ways that individuals understand and utilize health care along the border. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist."

At the heart of this pulse oximetry module will be a novel multiwavelength emitter having independent control of up to nine spectrally narrow wavelengths, ranging from blue to mid-IR, emitting from a single 1 mm2 LED die. In contrast with traditional dual-wavelength pulse oximetry, which measures oxygen saturation in the blood, the proposed multiwavelength LED will enable real-time analysis several additional metabolites critical to health monitoring via the same noninvasive paradigm. Furthermore, the individually controlled self-aligned wavelengths enable superior motion artifact cancellation, which is essential for eHealth and mobile fitness applications. The key objectives of this feasibility study are to: Demonstrate luminescent films with peak emissions from 400-1100 nm Integrate these films into a compact multiwavelength pulse oximetry module Optimize novel pulsing algorithms for multiwavelength pulse oximetry Validate the mobile multiwavelength pulse oximetry module in a lab setting      The medical impact of dual-wavelength pulse oximetry, in both saving lives and reducing healthcare costs, has encouraged the development of broader platforms using additional optical wavelengths. Incorporating 3 or more independently controlled wavelengths has been shown to enable the real-time monitoring of multiple health factors while further reducing readout errors ? thus saving more lives. Beyond blood oxygen monitoring, a real-time noninvasive assessment of renal and hepatic health can be realized by integrating several wavelengths in the same clinically accepted pulse oximetry paradigm.  Though multispectral pulse oximetry systems incorporating several optical sources have been successfully demonstrated by physicians and industry leaders, incorporating multiple LEDs (made from dissimilar semiconductors) has led to costly reliability errors and even product recalls. If successful the proposed mobile, multiwavelength single-die approach surmounts these limitations by providing independent control of several wavelengths from a single, self-aligned, compact LED.

As genome-wide analyses are being funded in both the public and private sectors, scientists and members of the lay public remain unclear about the connections between social classifications of race and human genetic variation as these bear on disease risk.  Nonetheless, genomic studies that sort DNA and other biological specimens by US census categories have become one acceptable norm for many in the genome sciences.  How do scientists grapple with questions of ""best practices"" on these issues when common health disparities, such as prostate cancer, disproportionately affect US minorities? How, and under what conditions, are social categories of identity effective for sifting through biogenetic differences characteristic of the human genome?  Finally, how do members of minority groups and concerned citizens of the lay public who are targeted for genetic studies help to shape, revise, or contest genetic uses of racial ascription?  The answers to these questions are of increasing relevance to public understandings of science.  This study employs extensive observational analyses and interviews with both geneticists and members of the lay public to chronicle how the societal and scientific expansion of genetic research on human variation influences key areas of social life.  These areas include biomedicine (through disease risk mapping), law (through forensic DNA database building), and personhood (through identity markers framed as ""ancestry""). One related question that this ethnographic study will begin to answer is how members of the public may or may not feel comfortable with the myriad potential uses to which their DNA can be put. A related major component of this social scientific study will focus on the ethical practices of research scientists who are mindful of the importance of diverse medical inclusion for biological and social reasons, while also having a personal commitment to empower and represent research subjects who are members of diverse communities.  Appeals to advance genetics for conditions that disproportionately affect African-Americans, in one lab, and injunctions to support new technological feats of personalized genomics, in another, are compared as lead geneticists' personal articulations of their goals merge with perceived societal needs.  This research also investigates how such work by geneticists may pose new concerns and constraints for the research participation of certain social groups."

If the frontiers of knowledge in Pittsburgh's biotechnology research and development community are to be advanced and scientific breakthroughs are to occur, trained biotechnicians must be available to meet the demand. The aim of the Biotechnology Workforce Collaborative (BWC) is to widen the spectrum of available, skilled workers in the region by enhancing ongoing partnerships with local stakeholders to a burgeoning program for the training of biotechnology/life sciences laboratory technicians.     The objectives and methods include:   (a) Academic training at the college resulting in the associate degree.  (b) A laboratory internship in the laboratories of Allegheny General Hospital,  Allegheny Singer Research Institute (ASRI), the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative (PTEI); and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine.  (c) Career development support for individual students starting at the early stages of participant preparation for college work and continuing in assistance for those students upon employment at various research laboratories.   (d) Workgroup meetings to further develop and refine the training approach for laboratory technicians.      Intellectual Merit: Recruitment efforts focus on developing three staggered cohorts of students. Both academic and employment criteria used in the field are being applied to the selection of promising candidates. Economically and educationally disadvantaged students are being supported by the project that integrates the associate degree for biotechnology technician with the workforce needs of research laboratories that specialize in molecular genetics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and innovation in the application of research results for health care. The collaborative effort includes an internship and long term support for career development of biotechnology/life sciences laboratory technicians.     Broader Impacts: Based on gender, ethnicity, and geography, the cohorts broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the biotechnology field, predominantly serving the biological sciences. As the BWC continues to become a major player in the Pittsburgh region, this project has an important role in advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning between the academic and industry partners. It enhances the infrastructure for research and education as a feeder to meet employment needs and as a critical link to industry."

The team includes expertise in   numerical algorithms and scientific computing, fluid and solid   biomechanics, PDE optimization, inverse problems, medical image   analysis and processing, and distributed and grid computing necessary   to tackle this class of problems.     This project aims to create a framework for assimilating multimodal   dynamic medical image data to produce highly-resolved,   physically-realistic, patient-specific biomechanics models. While the   computational and algorithmic aspects of the project are widely   applicable, the target application will be the construction of   patient-specific cardiac biomechanics models from 4D image datasets of   heart motion. Such models are useful for medical diagnosis and   surgical planning. This places a premium on quick turnaround of the   computations, which mean they must be fast, scalable, and capable of   exploiting grid-based computing.     Research will focus on three key areas that undergird the project's   overall goals: registration, inversion, and distributed computing. The   registration research component will create multilevel algorithms to   extract cardiac deformation histories from time-varying medical image   datasets via the solution of sequences of 3D image registration   problems. The inversion research component will develop multilevel   algorithms that use these deformation field histories as virtual   observations to solve inverse problems for cardiac biomechanical   parameters. The distributed computing research component will create   tools for performance prediction and resource scheduling that support   simulations across distributed computational resources.     Dovetailing with the research components, the project will undertake   an educational program designed to communicate the fruits of its work   and of the wider benefits of the integration of the biomedical   sciences, computing sciences, and computational sciences, to a more   general audience of students, disciplinary researchers, and the lay   public. The professional activities of the team members in the   inversion, image registration, grid computing, and computational   science communities will be parlayed to organize workshops and   international meetings, edit volumes, teach summer schools, develop   university and short courses, and engage in outreach activities---as   they have done in the past---but with greater emphasis on the field of   computational biomedicine. The proposed image-based cardiac   biomechanics modeling application will provide an excellent   opportunity to demonstrate the benefits to health and welfare that   advances in optimization-based registration and inversion algorithms   and Grid computing can provide."

It is well documented that biofilm cells are up to 1000 times more tolerant to antibiotics and disinfectants compared to their free-swimming counterparts. Consequently, deleterious biofilms cause serious problems in both industrial (persistent biofouling) and medical (chronic infections) settings. The research objective of this award is to investigate bacteria-surface and biofilm-flow interactions using integrated experimental approaches and mathematical modeling. Surfaces will be engineered with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) presenting different functional groups to guide biofilm formation in different patterns. The surface roughness and flow condition will also be rigorously controlled. The experimental study in such well-defined systems will be integrated with mathematical modeling to obtain critical information about biofilm formation mechanism. These data will help develop new methods to control bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, probe biofilm growth dynamics in a flow field, and investigate the roles of some important genes in biofilm formation.      This research can help address some important challenges such as prevention of persistent biofouling and corrosion in industrial settings, as well as control of medical device-associated infections in health care. The outcome of this study will improve our understanding of biofilm formation and help design better antifouling surfaces. This project will also provide a good opportunity to train students across multiple disciplines, and to recruit and retain young talents (especially the underrepresented groups) in science and engineering careers. The PIs will also create opportunities to get high school students and teachers involved in biofilm-related scientific activities."

Often, participation entails making changes in waste management practices. This dissertation project funded by the Science, Technology & Society Program is the second in a two-part ethnographic study of waste management and dengue fever prevention. It extends the Co-PI's current research in Ciudad Sandino, Nicaragua to the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health and the U.S. Centers of Disease Control (CDC). The objective is to find out how local ecological knowledge about dengue fever works its way into the practices of national and international experts on dengue, including epidemiologists, entomologists, physicians, and public health marketers in Nicaragua's Health Ministry and at the CDC.    Through research on policy development at CDC Health Marketing offices in the USA and CDC laboratories in Puerto Rico, policy adoption at the Ministry of Health in Managua, and application in Ciudad Sandino, the project addresses a problem that continues to vex medical and ecological anthropologists. Even when experts recognize the role of translocal forces (e.g. climate change, structural adjustment, urbanization) in environmental health crises, media and policymakers often dispense with macro-level explanations, circulating blame among the vulnerable people whom participatory strategies are meant to empower. The project treats urban public health as a set of social practices that links people in Ciudad Sandino to scientists and marketers, among whom consensus about etiology, diagnosis, and prevention remains elusive. Anthropologists of science and technology have helped place the struggle for consensus among medical experts in wider historical and social contexts. This project follows such debates as they ramify outside the laboratory, into clinical and preventative settings in urban Nicaragua, exposing underlying ambiguities that have placed the internationally developed dengue initiatives at odds with local efforts to improve infrastructure and create sustainable urban livelihoods.  The question before scholars interested in the social and cultural connections between ecology, disease, urban dwellers, scientists, and policymakers, is whether increased participation in health and infrastructure leads to a meaningful change in the production of knowledge about either. By taking a place-based approach to a health crisis, this research uncovers some of the material and discursive mechanisms by which citizens, experts, and the non-human actors who link them communicate, conflict, and possibly conciliate.    The project has broader impacts in that it helps facilitate understanding of how urban dwellers generate knowledge that is potentially beneficial for public health policymakers.  By following this knowledge through to centers for disease control, the PI is able to identify processes related to the deployment of knowledge and suggest means for improvement."

This grant establishes a Census Bureau Research Data Center (RDC) at the University of Minnesota. The goals of the Minnesota RDC are twofold. First, the RDC will help Minnesota researchers, working in collaboration with the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics, to support and improve basic data infrastructure for economic, demographic, and health research. Second, the RDC will stimulate new academic research that capitalizes on powerful restricted-access datasets to advance understanding of the sources and consequences of change in American society.  The Minnesota RDC will be housed in the Minnesota Population Center (MPC), an organization with a tradition of collaboration with the Census Bureau on projects to improve and disseminate Census data products. The Minnesota RDC will serve researchers from a broad range of academic disciplines, but will have particular strengths in demography and public health. Minnesota has outstanding researchers from social science and policy departments who will exploit newly-available demographic data to study topics such as marriage, migration, and family change. The University's top-ranked School of Public Health has unusual strength in large-scale data analysis and improvement and the nearby Mayo Clinic is developing new programs focusing on health data. Accordingly, a large pool of nationally-recognized investigators will take advantage of the recent agreement between the Census Bureau and NCHS and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The RDC will also serve traditional RDC researchers; economists from the distinguished departments of Economics, Applied Economics, and Industrial Relations--as well as the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank--will focus on analysis of economic microdata.     The availability of an RDC at the University of Minnesota will stimulate original and creative research in an array of academic fields such as sociology, economics, public affairs, and epidemiology. The restricted decennial and economic census data provide powerful resources for studying the long-run restructuring of the American population and economy. Social scientists at the University of Minnesota will be able to address simultaneously the broad sweep of time and the detail of spatial organization. Access to the internal NCHS and AHRQ data will result in a substantial body of new scientific and policy-relevant research into health behavior and disparities, access to and use of medical care, population aging, progress toward public health goals, and many other topics.     Broader Impacts: Because of MPC's history of collaboration with the Census Bureau and NCHS on large-scale data infrastructure projects, the Minnesota RDC will be uniquely positioned to benefit the entire RDC program and to assist the statistical agencies with data improvement projects. The Minnesota RDC will help users across the entire RDC network efficiently use restricted population and health data files, some of which Minnesota investigators helped to create. MPC researchers will continue collaborating with the Census Bureau and NCHS on improving restricted and public-use data and documentation. All RDC projects using Census Bureau restricted data will benefit the Census Bureau by contributing knowledge necessary to improve data collection, processing and dissemination.     One of the most important reasons for establishing an RDC at the University of Minnesota is to make this resource available to graduate students. Many students will be trained in the process of using the RDC--learning how to write successful research proposals, properly safeguard private data, and efficiently analyze the RDC data--by working with faculty members. Students from the University will also have free access to the RDC to pursue their own research projects."

Lee will conduct research on how international medical tourism affects local populations. Health care, once the most localized of activities, is expanding into a global arena.  The practice of patients traveling to foreign countries for medical procedures is now a rapidly expanding, multibillion dollar global industry. However, little is known about local social effects in the countries to which these ""tourists"" travel.    The research will be carried out in Costa Rica, long lauded for its successes in public health and a popular destination for elective medical procedures.  Despite pressures to privatize, the Costa Rican health system remains almost exclusively public, while medical tourism is a private industry.  This context provides a unique opportunity to examine the ways in which the line between public and private line is navigated, the impacts of integrating this powerful global industry into a state-oriented system, and the potential implications that medical tourism has for health care of local, underprivileged populations.    This project utilizes a multi-level, multi-sited, comparative ethnographic design to examine the relationships among international entities, national government, and on the ground practices that surround medical tourism.  Lee will interview brokerages in the United States to understand how companies operate and their relationship with hospitals in Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, she will conduct semi-structured interviews with health officials and carry out ethnographic field research in one public and one private hospital. She will observe and interview physicians, patients, and administrators; document hospital procedures and protocols; and collect information on attitudes and opinions about medical tourism, motivations to practice in the public or private sphere, comparative salaries and benefits, and job satisfaction.     The remarkable growth of medical tourism coupled with the lack of research in this arena makes this project timely and significant.  This project addresses important social policy issues, particularly for underrepresented populations, as well as issues of social responsibility for industries. It also contributes to the education of a social scientist."

It is  expected that research projects will be inspired, and in some  cases be newly developed, as a result of the workshops.  The  presentations include state of the art techniques in mathematical  sciences and engineering; an important addition in some of the  workshops is the inclusion of experimentalists who describe their  latest advances, the data sets that are obtained from those  experiments, and their anticipated results from that data.  Early  career participants, including a strong representation of  participants from underrepresented groups, are targeted.  The  Inverse Problems Center, IPRPI, provides an ideal environment to  hold these workshops.          The problem areas being targeted all impact quality of life  and safety of individuals.  Two of the workshops specifically  target medical imaging; one is in imaging of biomechanical tissue  properties, a new, very fast moving area with significant success  anticipated, and another considers diffusion optical tomography,  which also has a great deal of promise.  Successes in these two  areas significantly impact human health.  Two other workshops  emphazize identification in geosystems and waveform tomography.   Both target understanding the effects of earthquake dynamics, as  well as the identification of new energy sources.  As such, the  safety of individuals and quality of individual life is strongly  affected.

The intellectual merit of this proposal is represented for the first time by an advanced optical biomedical imaging approach for elucidating the complex dynamics of skin stem cells in vivo and within engineered skin grafts. The hypothesis of this research is that optical coherence and multi-photon microscopy, in an integrated platform, can uniquely track and quantify the different dynamic 3-D in vivo stem cell behaviors in and around autologous and allogeneic engineered skin grafts.     With the recent discovery of the skin stem cell niche located within the bulge region of hair follicles, many questions arise as to the dynamic behavior of these stem cells as they migrate from the bone marrow and into the skin niche, as well as in and out of the niche in response to skin injury and disease. This project therefore has intellectual merit in four areas. First, an advanced integrated microscope capable of simultaneous optical coherence and multi-photon microscopy will be utilized to uniquely visualize the structural and functional relationships of stem cells within in vivo skin. Second, this project investigates and longitudinally images in 3-D the migration patterns and dynamics of skin stem cells. This will provide fundamental insight into the role they play in maintaining the function and health of skin. Third, the effects of skin injury, induced by the placement of an autologous skin graft (skin punch biopsy), will be investigated, providing insight into the stem cell dynamics in the healing response. Fourth, this project will longitudinally image the stem cell and tissue responses in vivo following the grafting of allogeneic engineered skin constructs, contributing significantly to the understanding of how skin stem cells interact with engineered tissue grafts within biological hosts. The development and application of more quantitative imaging techniques to analyze the dynamics at the single-cell or cell-population levels will provide further insight into the ability to understand the role of skin stem cells, and ultimately provide a better approach for the treatment of human pathologies that require skin grafting. Taken together, this project is novel in each of these four areas, and the use of these advanced imaging techniques to carry out these investigations is transformative for the fields of stem cell biology and tissue engineering.    Considering the broader scope, the outcome of this project is likely to have a significant and broad impact on both the fundamental and clinical understanding on how stem cells behave dynamically in vivo. This project addresses major challenges in stem cell biology and tissue engineering: how to visualize and track cells and small populations of cells in vivo, in 3-D, and longitudinally over time in highly-scattering engineered and natural tissues.    This project will integrate state-of-the-art research with educational elements to advance discovery and promote teaching, training, and learning. Undergraduate students, in addition to graduate students, will complete theses related to this work. These students, as well as post-doctoral fellows and research scientists, will develop lifelong career skills in optics, image processing, cell and tissue culture and biology, and the use of pre-clinical models. Under-represented groups including women and minorities will be targeted for research opportunities, and annual laboratory and campus-wide open-house events will be held for outreach to K-12 and community groups. The results and image databases from this project will be disseminated widely through our educational website, local and national conferences, and leading scientific, engineering, and medical publications."

Mining data without violating the privacy of data being mined, however, is still a critical challenge. How to mine patients personal information, for example, is an ongoing problem in healthcare applications. Emerging privacy legislation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as the heightened public concerns about privacy protection, require immediate and resolute attention from the computing community on the protection of private information in data mining.    This research involves the understanding, analysis, and optimization of the tradeoff between privacy protection, accuracy of data mining, and system resources in privacy-preserving data mining.  The methodology is to establish a solid theoretical foundation that defines the requirements for privacy protection in data mining, identifies the domain of privacy-preserving strategies, and determines the achievability of such strategies.  This theoretical foundation enables the design and optimization of privacy-preserving data mining algorithms that are realistic, generic, and efficient.  The research results of this project have broader impacts on the nations higher education system and high-tech industries.  The ability to mine private data without violating the privacy of data owners is a must for a wide variety of corporations, universities, hospitals, and government agencies. Similarly, theoretically and empirically validated means to protect privacy in data mining would benefit all privacy-concerned individuals at large.  The impact of this project also extends to academia through educational efforts, including graduate and undergraduate student training, curriculum development, seminars, and outreach."

Radiotherapy is one of the most effective and noninvasive means for treating local and regional tumors. Generally speaking, the key to radiotherapy planning is how to deliver a radiation dose distribution that is localized to the tumor while minimizing the damage to nearby healthy tissues and structures. Since the discovery of radioactivity, many endeavors have been made to find that perfect particle for radiotherapy, which have led to the use of y-rays, X-rays, electrons, pions, protons, alpha particles, carbon ions, and most recently antiprotons. Generally speaking, an antiproton is a particle with the same mass as a proton but with a negative charge. Because of its large mass and the negative charge, anti-protons travel through tissue in a manner similar to those of heavy charged particles (such as protons and carbon ions) until they reach the end of their range, where they annihilate with a proton or neutron. This annihilation, which is unique to antiprotons, deposits much more energy compared to other heavy charged particles and induces significantly more biological damage. This exciting and unique radiobiological property of antiprotons makes them very attractive for radiotherapy and radiosurgery. In the last 5 years, many of the dosimetric and radiobiological properties of antiprotons have been investigated extensively. It is now time to develop the first ever treatment planning system for antiproton therapy in order to continue pushing this promising and emerging technique forward.    This research proposes to develop algorithms and software for planning antiproton therapy by bringing together techniques from graph algorithms, computational geometry, and operations research. Both dosimetric and radiobiological effects will be incorporated into the planning system, and a prototype treatment planning system for anti-protons will be developed and verified. While the focus of this proposal is on antiprotons for radiotherapy, it is important to note that the planning system is universally applicable to all forms of particle therapy. This would not only allow the direct comparison of these different modalities but would also make available all the advantages of the proposed treatment planning algorithms to other modalities currently used in patient treatments. Using antiprotons for the basis of the development has the advantage that the complexity of the problem is maximized and therefore the benchmarking of the developed planning system against experimental data presents the most stringent test for the algorithm and software possible.    Broader Impact: Successful completion of the project will be a first major step toward clinical application of antiproton therapy, which has the potential to help improve the quality of life for thousands of cancer patients each year with treatments of unparalleled quality and to potentially provide treatments for currently untreatable diseases. The theoretical aspect of this research will bring a new set of exciting and critical medical problems to the field of computer science and may give rise to novel approaches to some old but tough engineering problems. The study will bring together a group of renowned national and international scientists from a variety of disciplines such as high-energy physics, radiation oncology, medical physics and computer science to work on an important biomedical engineering problem. It will therefore overcome the intellectual barriers between these specialized disciplines and make recent advances in these areas accessible to a broader community of scientists, clinicians and engineers. The planned research also includes important clinical experimental components and provides educational activities in undergraduate and minority student recruitment and retention, course development and student training in the interdisciplinary area of biomedical engineering, computer science, medical physics, and health science. The research will be conducted at an EPSCoR and designated minority serving institution."

The dramatic increase in production rates of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and the anticipated widespread use of SWNTs in commercial and industrial applications suggest that these manufactured nanomaterials will inevitably enter the environment including the biosphere. In addition, there is a growing concern because of the currently unknown environmental and human health impacts of SWNTs.  Besides the toxicity issues common to all nanomaterials, the environmental and human health implications of SWNTs are complicated by the presence of impurities, such as the transition metal catalyst, and aggregation state.  These issues are also important problems to resolve in most SWNT applications.  Challenges still remain in purifying and dispersing SWNTs without detrimentally affecting the unique size-related characteristics such as strength, elasticity, high adsorption capacity, and controllable conductivity.  Future applications of nanotubes will be limited unless new approaches are developed to overcome these issues without impacting the unique properties of SWNTs.  Their long term goal is to develop stable, high-purity, SWNT dispersions based on large-scale processes that minimize the risks to the environment and human health.  They hypothesize that the environmental and human health impacts of engineered SWNTs can be reduced or eliminated through intimate coupling of toxicity testing and manufacturing during the production process.  Environmentally benign manufacturing is an important goal for the emerging nanomaterial industries, ensuring that risks to human health and the environment are minimal.  Indeed, nanotube processing has a tremendous opportunity to evolve as a ""green"" process, benefiting from the experience of previous industrial enterprises.  To test the hypothesis, engineering, chemistry, and toxicology will be integrated into a preemptive experimental approach.  If necessary, toxicity assessments will dictate refinement of the SWNT purification and dispersion processes to reduce their potential hazard.  This novel feedback feature intimately couples manufacturing with toxicity tests of produced SWNTs evaluated after each of the following key production steps: (1) synthesis and dry powder production (baseline toxicity); (2) purification; and (3) dispersion.  This work may provide a purification process which can achieve high purities and high yields of SWNTs without causing damage to the tubular structures while simultaneously minimizing risks to the environment.  Aside from the benefits of developing an environmental-friendly manufacturing process, this work will enable and accelerate nanotube applications impacting energy technologies, materials science, nanoelectronic, bionanotechnology, and medical fields.    A recent framework established by DuPont and Environmental Defense encourages the evaluation of toxicity effects at the design stage of nanomaterials so new, environmental-friendly processes can be developed.  The successful completion of this project will help identify the mechanisms by which SWNT dispersions affect aquatic organisms.  It is expected that this fundamental information will help reduce/eliminate the potential negative impacts of SWNTs.  An additional objective of this project is to disseminate the lessons learned from this research and develop an educational program targeting undergraduate students, especially from underrepresented groups.  Nanotechnology is a new frontier for the scientists and engineers of the 21st century.  NSF estimates that 2 million workers will be needed to support future nanotechnology industry needs.  However, the decreasing enrollment of U.S. students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees make it challenging to prepare the needed workforce.  The PIs are currently developing modules for a sequence of two undergraduate courses aimed at integrating nanotechnology and its environmental, societal, and health implications into the current undergraduate curricula. These courses will, therefore, be used as a vehicle to integrate their exciting research findings into new educational materials."

This research focuses on a class of proteins, cadherins, which are essential for the formation and maintainenance of organized tissues. Engineering approaches, including nanomechanics, cell manipulation, and surface chemical modification will address three key aspects of cadherin function that are central to cadherin's role in developmental biology, tissue formation, and bioengineering: specifically, (1) the physical chemical basis of selective cell-to-cell adhesion, (2) molecular mechanism(s) of cadherin activation and affinity modulation by a novel class of activating (and potentially therapeutic) antibodies, and  (3) mechanical transduction between cells and the link between cadherin subtype, adhesion biophysics, and cadherin-dependent intracellular signaling.    The intellectual merit of this research lies in the novel discoveries engendered by this multidisciplinary combination of engineering, biophysics, and cell biological approaches. Preliminary studies by this PI already identified unique thermodynamic and kinetic signatures of cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion.  This enabling discovery will further the identification of distinguishing mechanistic features that are postulated to underlie the selective adhesion between cells, affinity regulation, and signal transduction by these essential adhesion proteins. Aim 1 exploits these findings i) to identify mechanisms of cadherin adhesion and ii) to quantify kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that influence selective cell-to-cell adhesion.  The transformative power of these investigations lies in their capacity to identify the physical chemical properties of cadherin bonds postulated to direct cell segregation during tissue formation (Aim 1).  Related investigations will in turn identify how recently isolated, cadherin-activating antibodies increase (or modulate) cadherin binding affinity (Aim 2). Activating antibodies have tremendous therapeutic potential, and these studies will define general, molecular design rules for biochemical modulators of cadherin adhesion.  Finally, Aim 3 extends the PI's preliminary findings that different cadherins elicit distinct intracellular signaling responses that are seemingly independent of the protein bond strengths.  This entirely novel result constitutes a major paradigm shift, because in four decades of research, attempts to determine the basis of cadherin-specific cell interactions exclusively focussed on the extracellular domains. Aim 3 exploits this unique discovery, and will break new ground in identifying key biological design rules that regulate tissue (cadherin)-specific cell functions.     The broad impact of this program derives from its direct relevance to bioengineering and human health and from its educational impact through outreach to women and minorities at both the pre-college and undergraduate levels. Cadherins are essential for tissue genesis and they maintain the structural integrity of all solid tissues; consequently, the results of this program will impact several areas of bioengineering and basic cell biology, including, neural development, embryogenesis, cancer, diseases of the intestinal epithelium, vascular leakage diseases, wound healing, tissue regeneration, stem cell differentiation, and tissue engineering. For example, in collaboration with B. Gumbiner at the University of Virginia Medical School, the research team will uniquely determine the mechanism(s) of cadherin affinity modulation by novel, cadherin-activating antibodies, which could potentially treat a wide range of cadherin-related diseases. Investigations of cadherin binding and intracellular signaling will further identify physical and bio-chemical mechanisms that may contribute to cell segregation, tissue patterning, and possibly tissue-specific functions during tissue formation, repair, and regeneration. These investigations will also identify biochemical and biophysical parameters that are required to mimic cell-cell interactions in tissue scaffolds and engineered environments.    Several of the technologies described in this proposal will also be used as vehicles for outreach activities to middle school girls, minority undergraduates, and women and minorities in Chicago area high schools.  In partnerships with outreach programs at the University of Illinois, the PI seeks to alter preconceptions of science and scientific careers often held by middle- and high-school students.  She will also use some of the research activities described in this proposal to mentor undergraduates participating in summer research projects for underrepresented minorities in science and engineering.    This program will also continue to support the training of students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering. The PI has mentored 16 senior thesis students, approximately 40% of which were women. At the graduate level, the PI mentored 2 female Masters candidates, 9 female PhD candidates, 2 African American PhD candidates, and one Hispanic male PhD student. This program offers timely research opportunities that will continue to attract diverse students and provide quality opportunities in research and engineering from pre-college to graduate educational levels."

However, the size requirements for complete elimination of currently available nanoparticles from the body may limit their clinical utility. In response to this challenge we recently reported preparation and testing of a new composite material, biodegradable plasmon resonant nanoshells.  This fundamentally new class of materials maintains optical tunability characteristic of solid metallic shells, yet upon degradation yields individual clusters of diameter compatible with the requirements of renal clearance. Biodegradable metallic nanoshells may enable clinical translation of many research-stage technologies, including imaging and therapeutic applications of gold nanoparticles studied by these investigators earlier.  The main goal of this research plan is to evaluate applications of degradable gold nanoshells in medical diagnostics and therapy.   Photothermal conversion, content release as well as molecular targeting of degradable nanoshells will be studied. Specificity of delivering agents to cell types of interest will be determined. The subcellular fate of the released contents will be detailed to evaluate mechanisms to enhance delivery to cells, and the ability of the delivered agent (siRNA) to effect cell function will be investigated.      An integral part of this research project is to provide research and educational opportunities to students with interest in engineering materials on the nanometer scale for applications in human health.  In addition to a graduate student support, this research plan will create educational opportunities within two programs active at the University of Arizona, Undergraduate Biology Research Program and a summer research program for underrepresented high school students with interest and abilities in science.  This experience will subsequently help these investigators enhance educational curriculum in areas of photonics, molecular biology and material science, or more broadly, nanomedicine."

First, the use of one monomer ultimately affords a higher loading capacity per gram of polymer, which can improve applications such as solid phase extraction and analytical separations. The increased rebinding capacity of OMNiMIPs could lead to applications beyond current limits of MIPs, such as high capacity removal of target compounds in solid phase extraction, environmental clean-up, or protein-purification strategies. We are currently investigating the underlying principles that are responsible for the high capacity and selectivity of OMNiMIPs. The higher capacity also affords higher performance for imprinting several different target compounds simultaneously, facilitating assays and separations of multiple analytes. This could be important for assays on mixtures of different compounds, such as the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations or solid phase extraction of an array of different molecules. In addition, novel chiral OMNiMIPs appear capable of imprinting racemic mixtures, providing an easier route to chiral stationary phases. This would eliminate the need for enantiopure templates, normally required for traditional MIPs. Last, OMNiMIPs will be hybridized with conjugated polymers to provide a material that can generate a fluorescence signal upon binding the target molecule, which is useful for sensors and other detection strategies.  An important theme for the research described in this proposal is to utilize molecular control of the monomer starting materials toward optimizing macroscopic properties (e.g. loading capacity and selectivity) of OMNiMIPs. The heart of this proposal is the design, synthesis and evaluation of new crosslinkers for the OMNiMIP process that will maximize the performance of these materials for the applications described above. Using the molecular structure of successful crosslinkers as lead compounds, analogs with rational changes will be evaluated for improvements in structure-property relationships. This proposal describes the fundamental development of new MIP materials that both improve performance and are capable of unique applications that have not been available from this technology in the past. It is important to determine the optimal crosslinker structures as quickly as possible in order to provide researchers worldwide with the best materials for their applications.      For society, the promise of molecular imprinting is the detection of medical and environmental toxins, detection and neutralization of national security target compounds, tailored catalysts, and separation media that will serve the health and advancement of mankind in numerous ways. These broader impacts of molecular imprinting will be enhanced in several ways by the development of OMNiMIPs for novel applications such as those described above. While the development of these materials should be seen as a major practical outcome of this research, these studies will also contribute to the fundamental understanding of the underlying principles of the OMNiMIP effect and how these differ from traditional molecular imprinting approaches. Furthermore, the development of OMNiMIPs has stimulated numerous collaborations with researchers, both nationally and internationally, resulting in many interesting studies toward the increased performance of these materials for current and new applications. OMNiMIP research has also provided opportunities for undergraduates and a high school student to participate in cutting edge research and present their results at conferences. The real credit for the success and fun of OMNiMIP research belongs to the diverse group of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows who have engaged themselves in the day-to-day problem solving that has made this research flourish. Our group is talented and draws evenly from underrepresented groups that are mentored well here at LSU. Their training in molecular imprinting and OMNiMIPs continues to present opportunities that interface important chemical disciplines naturally, providing an interdisciplinary education that will enhance their competitiveness in the current and future marketplace.

Given the U.S. demographic trends (aging population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases), nursing staff shortages, and decreasing hospital capacities, it is no surprise that the U.S. healthcare system faces immense challenges on a daily basis.  Multiple studies have shown that the use of inefficient tools in the patient care process is one of the root causes behind overcrowded and inefficient hospitals.  Thereby, tools that automate the patient monitoring process will greatly improve the quality and effectiveness of health care.  While these needs are widely accepted, a multitude of problems confront technology developers.  First, a multi-stage infrastructure, including sensing devices, wired and wireless networks, and back-end servers, is necessary to generate medically relevant results.  Second, healthcare providers have understandably little time and patience to work with untested technologies and engineering prototypes.  Finally, healthcare facilities and research with human subjects present unique technical, administrative, and ethical challenges that few technologists have encountered.    This project will address these challenges through the development of miSense, an end-to-end platform for medical sensing applications.  miSense includes all hardware and software components to design, develop, and deploy compelling sensing applications in the healthcare field, including open-platform devices (miTags) for connecting medical sensors, a wireless mesh network (miNet) for delivering data, and servers (miStore, miView) to store, analyze, and display patient data.  Furthermore, the project will develop three medical sensing applications (miLabs) and deploy them in the JHU Emergency Department, the JHU Children's Center and the University of Maryland Trauma Center.  miSense will revolutionize medical sensing applications and healthcare, as the TinyOS project revolutionized sensor networks and their applications to the sciences.  Finally, this project will offer opportunities for transdisciplinary learning between computer scientists, physicians, nursing professionals, undergraduates, and high school students through involvement in the project and joint course development."

While significant advancements are being made in this area, most efforts are isolated and independent, limiting the collective progress and making it difficult for new researchers to enter the field.  This planning project establishes a foundation for the development of community research, education, and support infrastructure to help advance the field of BSNs.  The project activities include 1) soliciting input from a broad community of researchers, educators, and domain experts to establish the consensus needs of the BSN community; 2) developing initial models for BSN hardware, software, and support infrastructure; and 3) developing a business model to ensure that cost is not a barrier to BSN research, education, or application. The ultimate goals of this project are to 1) increase the relevance and practicality of BSN research and development by enabling engineers to experiment with standardized physical systems and achieve more practical results; 2) empower new researchers and educators to enter the field with an inexpensive, substantial, and ultimately self-sustaining support infrastructure; and 3) provide teachers at all levels of education the infrastructure and educational modules to incorporate BSNs into their classrooms and laboratories, providing hands-on experiences through which students can see how computer science and engineering can have a direct impact on human health and quality of life."

907070,High-Dimensional Predictive Density Estimation,DMS,STATISTICS,15-Jul-09,4-Jul-09,"Xu, Xinyi",OH,Ohio State University Research Foundation,Standard Grant,Yazhen Wang,30-Jun-12,113851,,xinyi@stat.osu.edu,1960 KENNY RD,Columbus,OH,43210,6142923732,MPS,1269,OTHR|0000,0000099    Other Applications NEC                  |,907070,"This research concerns the development of a new methodology for predictive analysis, which extracts information from historical and current data to predict future trends and behavior patterns. The Bayesian approach is appealing for this problem because it provides a complete predictive density that assigns probabilities to every possible outcome, and it naturally incorporates the uncertainty inherent in the parameter estimation and model selection processes.  The prior specification for Bayesian predictive procedures, however, becomes challenging as the number of potential predictors grows, an all too common problem as massive data sets are increasingly prevalent in many scientific areas.  In this project, the PI investigates the use of Bayesian techniques for predictive density estimation and their frequentist properties, and then exploits those properties to construct new families of priors that have desirable risk properties, adapt to unknown data structures and also permit tractable computation for large and complex data sets. These priors are ""minimally informative"" in the sense that they allow input of subjective information through the choice of prior center, yet utilize this information in a very robust fashion.  The resulting predictive estimators effectively combine information from different dimensions and therefore improve overall prediction performance. Applications in financial and social problems will be developed using the new methodology.    Extracting information from massive data sets and exploiting it to make predictions of future uncertain events are fundamental problems in both statistics and the sciences.  The proposed research provides not only powerful theoretical tools, but also easily-implementable computing strategies for predictive analysis.  It can help researchers in various fields to better identify risks and opportunities, and thus to optimize their decision making. The methodological developments are motivated by a portfolio allocation problem in finance and a missing data imputation problem in the social sciences. The proposed procedures are applicable to many other scientific and technical areas, such as genomics, climatology, medical sciences and public health, where large data sets are collected and accurate predictive analysis is desirable.  For example, in health care service studies, predicting people's future health care costs is an important topic given a high concentration of health care expenditures among a relatively small percentage of the population.  Using the proposed methods, one may better exploit information in vast medical and insurance databases to identify the individuals with high health risks and to predict their future medical costs.  To facilitate the use of these new methods, the PI will implement the procedures and algorithms in R or Matlab, and make this software available to the public along with the associated research reports."

Six factors promoting reproductive tourism have been cited in the literature.  These include religious prohibitions, lack of expertise and supplies, safety, discrimination against certain categories of individuals, shortages and waiting lists, and costs.  However, these causes of reproductive tourism remain conjectural, as this phenomenon has never been studied empirically. Thus, the proposed study is the first of its kind to investigate the new global phenomenon of reproductive tourism on an empirical level.      This study will investigate and compare reproductive tourism in two highly mobile, migrant communities in the Arab world: 1) the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the current tourist capital of the Middle East; and 2) ""Arab Detroit,"" the largest Arab ethnic enclave in North America and the so-called capital of Arab America.  Both of these sites are home to ART centers that cater primarily to Muslim populations. ART center clientele include migrants who have settled in these communities for economic and political reasons, only to discover that they are infertile, as well as ""reproductive tourists"" who travel from distant countries with the intention of receiving medical advice, the latest technologies, and, in some cases, donor gametes.    In each site, data will be collected to test four major hypotheses concerning: 1) the causes of reproductive tourism; 2) Islamic attitudes toward bodily commodification and human gamete donation; 3) arenas of constraint on ART-seeking; and 4) gender and marital relations, as they affect and are affected by reproductive tourism. These domains of inquiry are important, given unique features of reproductive tourism in the Arab world: for  example, a Sunni Muslim ban on third-party gamete donation versus recent encouragement of donor technologies in Shi'a Islam.  In addition, the Arab Gulf is a particularly interesting site of reproductive tourism, given its oil wealth, large expatriate labor force, and high rates of arranged marriage, consanguinity, and polygyny. This stands in contrast to Arab Detroit, where a significant portion of the approximately 400,000 Arab residents:, including many recent war refugees from Lebanon and Iraq, endure impoverished lives, yet require reproductive health services.  	  This  research is  the first of its kind to examine the growing global phenomenon of reproductive tourism within the Arab world and also generally.  As such, it will contribute to multiple fields of study, including medical anthropology, the anthropology of globalization, science and technology studies, gender studies, and Middle Eastern studies in a post-September 11th, war-in-Iraq era. In addition, the empirical findings of this research are of great importance to social policy, given increasing calls for legislation of ARTs and reproductive tourism on a global level.  This study can provide insights into the experiences and concerns of reproductive tourists themselves, thereby shedding light on a world of global reproductive tourism that is burgeoning, but still shrouded in mystery."

When invaders are species of medical importance, such as vectors, pathogens, or reservoir hosts, successful invasion may also result in disease emergence.  Lyme disease is the leading vector-borne disease of humans in the United States, and cases are increasing in part due to ongoing range expansions of the blacklegged tick.  Over the past five years, the research team has tracked an active invasion of blacklegged ticks and the Lyme disease pathogen in Michigan through investigations of wildlife hosts in the field, and have provided an early warning of this emerging threat.  The team will analyze the genetic diversity of the pathogen collected from host-seeking ticks to infer the geographical source of the invading ticks and pathogen as well as how they are invading across the landscape.     This research provides a model for elucidating an invasion in real-time of an emerging disease.  Broader impacts include aiding local and regional health departments and natural resource agencies, as the data collected herein will allow assessment of disease risk and offer points for intervention.  Furthermore, this research is the founding project for Michigan State University's new research specialization in conservation medicine, which trains students in ecology, microbiology, human medicine, and veterinary medicine to work together to solve problems of emerging diseases that impact human, wildlife, and domestic animal health."

As a result of the previous project, 29 students were successfully placed in jobs in federal agencies or labs, including those with healthcare security interests.    The relevance of this goal has since been repeatedly underscored at the highest levels of the federal and state health infrastructures by mandates to broaden utilization of information technology in the delivery of healthcare while protecting the security and privacy of health information exchanges and on-line databases. It is now widely recognized that establishment of trusted national healthcare information networks and databases to unify health and medical computing infrastructures, streamline healthcare monitoring and delivery, and accelerate research and dissemination of health and medical data while assuring that privacy is systemically protected have collectively achieved the scope of a critical national challenge.    This project provides its graduate students: (a) Rigorous and broad educational foundations addressing the theory, design, and applications of IS&A technologies; (b) Healthcare policy, management, and privacy issues; and (c) Potential vulnerabilities associated with computer-based medical devices, which increasingly have networking and wireless capabilities.    Broad Impact: The goal of this proposal is to provide the option to 15 new students to complete either the Master of Science in Security Informatics (MSSI) degree program or a dual MSSI/Master of Health Sciences (MHS) program, which was developed by means of a previous SFS capacity building grant. Focused outreach to assure diversity for this healthcare security opportunity takes advantage of existing partnerships with HBCUs and MSIs.    Intellectual Merit: The dual masters program made available to the new SFS scholars is based on an integration of courses, labs, research projects, and internships stemming from the two different academic cultures represented by the public health and computing schools. The intellectual merit of this partnership is represented by the development and implementation of a unique interdisciplinary framework supporting educational cross-training regarding IS&A technologies relative to healthcare security applications. Selected healthcare security courses to support the dual MSSI/MHS degree are made accessible in an on-line format."

Technology infrastructure in the healthcare realm requires secure and effective systems to meet two of its most significant challenges of the 21st century: improving the quality of care and controlling costs. Yet developing, deploying and using information technology that is both secure and genuinely effective in the complex clinical, organizational and economic environment of healthcare is a significant challenge. This project's multidisciplinary approach will develop and analyze information-sharing technology that ensures security and privacy while meeting the pragmatic needs of patients, clinical staff, and healthcare organizations to deliver efficient, high-quality care.     Dartmouth's Trustworthy Information Systems for Healthcare (TISH) Program addresses fundamental challenges in current and emerging areas of information security in healthcare:	protecting the security of clinical information, while ensuring that clinicians can access information they need, when and where they need it, and securing the collection of sensor data through personal sensor devices (including both physiological and activity data) to enable monitoring of patient outcomes while giving patients usable control over their privacy.    To be effective, such technologies must consider the economic, organizational and sociological dynamics that are critical to creating and implementing IT that is secure as well as usable and effective. Thus, the researchers will consider: usability, and its implications for secure information sharing throughout the organizational environment of medical care; privacy concerns, examining how key stakeholders (patients, clinicians, and other providers) understand and evaluate the trade-offs between information sharing, usability, security, and privacy: economic risks, identifying the economically motivated threats to security and privacy in healthcare information systems and the incentives for adopting security technology; and security challenges related to collection, processing, and medical use of data from sensors worn by outpatients    This research will result scientific advances in several fields. The team will develop new secure and efficient protocols that allow remote health monitoring through a mobile phone and wearable wireless medical sensors; design new machine-learning methods, especially active-learning and relational-learning techniques for analyzing and summarizing sensor data in a user-friendly manner; seek a deeper understanding of the economics of information security in healthcare; and explore how patients and clinicians trade off usability, security, and privacy.     TISH, a collaborative project of the Institute for Security, Technology, and Society at Dartmouth College, involves a team from Computer Science, Sociology, the Dartmouth Medical School, and the Tuck School of Business. Its researchers include computer scientists with expertise in computer security and sensor networks, sociologists with expertise in healthcare organizations and health policy, a clinician with medical informatics expertise, and a business professor with expertise in the economics of information security.  The TISH team will work in collaboration with local hospitals and health systems in the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire."

The target application supports communication between healthcare personnel who speak English only and patients with limited-English proficiency.  The state-of-the-art technologies that enable such cross-lingual interactions are characterized by a pipelined architecture of speech recognition, machine translation and speech synthesis, that largely ignore the rich information present in spoken language beyond those conveyed by words.  They also do not take advantage of the humans in the loop for collaboratively managing the interaction. Overcoming these limitations requires improving robust intelligence at all levels ? signal, system, and human ? and set the research goals for this project.     The project?s intellectual merit comes from the unique combination of theoretical, computational model-ing and empirical elements: The theoretical framework is centered on notions of social co-presence to de-velop new models for translation-mediated communication. The computational modeling focuses on capturing prosody, dialog and user state from spoken language for enriching the technology components.  The empirical work relies on a participatory approach to iterative design and evaluation of the system, working directly with the stakeholders.    The broader impact can be seen in the potential for facilitating multilingual efforts ranging from disaster relief and global business operations to servicing diverse immigrant populations notably in health care. The effort brings together engineers, linguists, human communication experts, and medical professionals to tackle a broad range of problems, and offers integrated interdisciplinary research training and mentor-ing."

Focusing research efforts on issues of harmful algal blooms (HABs) and microbial pollution of recreational marine waters, the University of Miami strategy has been to build upon existing cooperative efforts and seek out new researchers, blending strengths from those activities in oceanography and biomedical sciences.     In the course of the last five years, we have expanded the original breadth of our Oceans and Human Health Center substantially through leveraged funding and involving new researchers. In particular, in the area of microbial pollution, we have performed human health and exposure studies with predictive mathematical modeling in the microbe component and added methacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureas to the microbe component; and in the area of HABs, we have demonstrated that the neurotoxic amino acid, beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), may be an important toxin in the food web, and we have developed diagnostic and prognostic modeling showing a new source for Florida red tide blooms.     With funding from this Accomplishment-based Renewal, research at the University of Miami OHH Center over the next two years will build and expand on two important ongoing areas of Center research: 1) the modeling of the transport of microbes from the shoreline of a nonpoint source beach within a sub/tropical environment as well as pathogen behavior in this beach and near-shore environment; and 2) further exploration of HAB organisms and their toxins in the marine food chain, focusing on the water soluble neurotoxin, BMAA, associated with blue green algae (cyanobacteria) and the lipophilic neurotoxin, brevetoxin, associated with the Florida red tide organism, Karenia brevis.      Broader Impacts:   Research for the next two years of the UM OHH Center will provide: a) a real-time predictive modeling tool for water quality conditions at beach sites as well as important data on pathogens and sand; b) the exploration of the extent of toxin transfer within the marine food chain of two important but different HAB toxins. These research activities will be supported by training and outreach in oceans and human health. Graduate students will be supported in both research projects. There will be an OHH Program to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to work with the Research Projects and their investigators. Opportunities will also be made available for OHH Center investigators and students to travel nationally and internationally to present the results of their OHH research and interact with the other OHH Centers in scientific conferences (including participation in the Second OHH Gordon Research Conference and Graduate Research Seminar in June 2010), as well as interact with visiting OHH Scientists sponsored by the Center. The Center will continue to support the 24/7, 365 day/yr toll-free Aquatic Toxins Hotline (888-232-8635) at the Florida Poison Information Center to provide information on harmful algal bloom exposures and health effects to healthcare providers, patients and the general public, as well as expand the uses and dissemination of the Center Website (www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/ohh/). Finally, the Center researchers are involved in expanding and disseminating an ongoing graduate and upper level undergraduate course in Oceans and Human Health, and the development of a new Textbook on the Socio-Economic Impacts and Human Wellbeing in Oceans and Human Health."

Medical anthropology is a subfield of anthropology that employs social, cultural, biological, and linguistic anthropological methods and theory. Medical anthropologists study how interrelationships between humans and other species, cultural norms and social institutions, and micro and macro politics and economics at multiple scales interact with the health of individuals, larger social formations, and the environment. The field is now just fifty years old. The overarching agenda of this conference is to consider what medical anthropology has contributed to basic scientific research  and to create new research agendas and collaborations for the future.     The four day conference will be anchored by thirteen plenary speakers who will highlight the potential for future research in the most significant research areas. The speakers will report on the social science of health research from a variety of perspetives, including inequality, science and technology, genomics, bioethics, and the science of public policy. The conference also will provide a forum for the dissemination of new findings and the development of international collaborations through research working group sessions.  A special student poster session will provide an opportunity for senior medical anthropologists to offer constructive feedback to the next generation of scientists.      This conference is important because the last half-century of research has shown that across the globe, social and cultural institutions, not just medical practice, have significant influence in human and community health. This conference will bring together the very best researchers in this area to move the field forward at a time of critical need."

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will combine the capabilities of Picarro's WS-CRDS (wavelength-scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy) instrumentation with Gas Chromatography (GC) - Combustion (C) technology. This new high-precision, but low cost analyzer will simultaneously measure hydrogen (D/H) and carbon (13C/12C) isotope ratios of organic molecules and provides critical insight into underlying biochemical processes. One important application is the administration of deuterium- and/or 13C-labeled organic compounds to a subject and the use of isotopic ratio monitoring to track the fate of the labeled compound across time and body tissues. Such high-precision measurements are currently obtained with Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS), which are too large, expensive, and laborintensive for wide use. In addition, two separate IRMS systems are needed for simultaneous hydrogen and carbon isotopic measurements. Picarro's GC-C-CRDS analyzer will be a high-precision, small, and inexpensive single-system replacement for IRMS to quantify both hydrogen and carbon isotopes.     The broader impact of this research is the cost reduction in health care through the advancement of preventative medicine by enabling the large-scale use of stable isotopes as tracers for metabolic research studies and medical diagnosis (insulin resistance, for instance) through the availability of an inexpensive and high-performance isotopic analyzer for clinical deployment and the subsequent possibility of fast, local, advanced medical testing and diagnosis in remote and economically disadvantaged communities. After establishing the GC-C-CRDS analyzer in research laboratories with this grant, Picarro intends to extend its presence to hospitals, clinics, and biopharmaceutical laboratories."

This project will address this divide through a novel approach that employs conversational agent technology to reduce the critical cognitive and social-psychological barriers hindering older users in web-based consumer environments. The goal of this project is to broaden the engagement of the growing yet underrepresented senior population in Internet technology, a medium that can dramatically improve their quality of life. This goal closely aligns with the human-centered computing objective of transforming the human-computer interaction experience through the development of systems that are aware of the abilities and special needs of people that use them. Research on animated pedagogical agents has revealed promising results on the effectiveness of agents in learning and motivation. However, no previous research program has investigated how agent technology can be designed to promote autonomy and empowerment in the older population, particularly in web-based consumer environments, involving multi-dimensional information processing and complex decision-making. To address this critical gap in the research, this project will systematically investigate, three aspects of agent interactions with older users: 1) locus of control (agent vs. user), 2) interactional style (functional vs. relational), and 3) modality of exchange (unimodal-voice vs. unimodal-text vs. dualmodal-voice + text). This research program will apply a multi-phase, mixed-methods approach involving qualitative studies in the first phase, and a series of controlled experiments with over 400 older users in subsequent phases.  The purpose is to examine the effectiveness of the three aspects of agent-user interaction in: 1) reducing cognitive barriers (reducing information load, increasing navigation convenience, enhancing information search and retrieval ease), 2) reducing social-psychological barriers (enhancing control and efficacy, increasing trust, enhancing perception of social support), and 3) increasing Internet technology use intent. The experimental studies will further determine whether users' gender, visual or hearing impairments, and prior Internet competency interact with the three aspects of agent-user interaction to affect the desired outcomes. The findings from this project will generate new knowledge on how multimodal systems employing conversational agents can be designed for the abilities and special needs of older users leading to a potentially transformative and empowering experience for this underrepresented population in information technology.    Seniors are increasingly finding the necessity to engage in web-based consumer environments (e.g., online banking, shopping, trading, travel reservations). While the functionality of agents in these domains merits examination, the broader significance of this project lies in its ability to inform the development of agent-mediated interfaces for other applications such as websites that provide important health and medical information to seniors. Anecdotal evidence gathered by the project team from a prototype system has revealed the transformative potential of this technology for older users. This pilot research funded by the Office of Outreach at Auburn University, has extended the impact of this project to constituents in the state of Alabama. In addition to research, outreach will also serve as an important mission in the dissemination of future findings from this project to stakeholders at local and national levels. With the goal of enhancing diversity in research and education, this project will also involve a greater representation of African-American (AA) study participants from surrounding counties in Alabama, and actively engage AA graduate students, who are already part of the PI's lab in the educational goal of this project.

The medical care costs of people with chronic diseases account for more than 75% of the estimated $1.4 trillion for medical care costs in the United States.  Yet, there are significant challenges in creating technologies that enable individuals to proactively manage their health and that enable physicians, therapists and educators to effectively and efficiently treat people with chronic, long-term health challenges. This research examines the role of personal health technologies for individuals and health care practitioners engaged in chronic disease management and disease prevention and wellness.  Building on our initial research in technologies for diabetes management, we propose four threads of inquiry that are integrated into our research activities: (1) Mobile Technologies for Personalized Health, (2) Automated Techniques for In-The-Moment Health Advice, (3) Tools for Experimentation, and (4) Measurement Techniques to Assess Personal Health Care Technologies.     The broad goal is to design technologies that help people take ownership of their own health and wellness.  Advancing the use of information technologies outside of the scope of traditional critical care is of paramount importance for making progress in this thorny area.  Research results will begin to push the influence of health technologies ?up the chain? from disease management to disease prevention and wellness."

In today's society, life experiences are often processed in an online world. Online resources provide information and support for parenting, health, hobbies, news, and more. However, online resources are often incomplete, may include a diversity of opinions, and may be inaccurate. In a connected series of research studies exploring general theoretical questions, this project focuses on a compelling and common example of uncertainty online - the uncertainty about treatments for a chronic health condition. Chronic disease is a leading cause of ill health world wide, and one in ten Americans lives with a life-altering chronic condition. Unlike acute conditions (such as a high fever), chronic conditions, such as HIV, diabetes, arthritis, and Lyme disease, are prolonged and rarely cured completely. For this reason, management of chronic conditions lies much more in the hands of the patient.    This research will study online health resources and individuals' use of these online resources using interview data, survey data, and text analysis of thousands of pages and posts available in online content. First, it will characterize the uncertainty of different types of online resources. Second, it will focus on how uncertainty impacts a specific community characterized by highly uncertain and even controversial information about the disease process and treatment (the Lyme disease community). And third, the research will test the generalizability of results in a complementary setting (such as individuals with chronic arthritis). The empirical work will answer the following questions: 1) How does the existence of incomplete, divergent and/or conflicting information affect the health choices made by individuals with chronic illness? 2) What factors (community, time, exposure to information) are critical to an individual with chronic illness deciding whether to believe in a specific viewpoint?    The results will drive the design of two technological interventions that can improve people's ability to understand and decide among online resources: (1) A tool to extract and highlight key parameters of decision making derived from the research, that will crawl relevant sources and extract information such as patient consensus, medical research timeline, and risks. (2) A tool to classify online resources in terms of viewpoint, leveraging machine-learning techniques such as co-training to learn classifications on the fly. The second tool will inform the first, but also provide an interface for sorting and filtering online information and compare the information cloud associated with different viewpoints.  The results of this research will add to existing knowledge about how the Internet can support individuals with chronic conditions, and contribute to the development of curriculum for courses on human-computer interaction in the medical area."

In Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) this tessellation (or finite element mesh) is a critical component  for  patient-specific  bio-mechanics  and  bio-fluid finite element (FE)  simulations.  In this project, we target I2M conversion for image guided  neurosurgery and endoscopic neck and head surgery.  Specifically, we  focus  on FE-based non-rigid  registration methods  which  use patient-specific   bio-mechanical  models  to fuse pre-operative  intra-operative brain  images (eg.   Magnetic Resonance Images and/or Computed Tomography Scans).    The objective of  this project is to  extend the Delaunay  refinement  algorithms and theory for guaranteed quality    I2M   conversion  that  meets     additional requirements related to:  (1)  accuracy of non-rigid registration   of brain images, and (2)  real-time constrains imposed by neurosurgery or head and neck surgery. The intellectual merit of this work is the development of novel  theoretical framework  which  extends existing point  insertion methods for both scalar  and parallel guaranteed quality Delaunay mesh generation.  These  extensions increase algorithm flexibility which is important to  satisfy application-specific requirements like fidelity.    The  proposal will have a  broader impact on several areas in both  CAS and Computer Aided  Design (CAD).  Non-rigid registration of medical images is an enabling  technology for many applications in CAS which is  a  rapidly  growing  area in   health  care industry.    Our algorithms will contribute in the prevention of medical errors and the  use of new (more  effective/accurate)  technologies which can lead  to products (i.e., image  guided neuro-navigation systems) that will help reduce medical and  hospitalization expenses.  Specifically, (1) image guided neurosurgery  increases  the  percentage  of  successful  tumor resections while minimizing the  potential for neurological deficit by preserving critical tissue  and hence improves prognosis for  patient, and (2) minimally invasive  endoscopic  surgery results in less  blood loss  and reduced  post-operative  pain  lead  to faster recovery  and earlier discharge of patients.   In addition  technology based on  our I2M conversion algorithms can be  used in medical simulators which can improve doctor training and minimize errors in medical procedures."

Changes in patterns of the secretion of one to six or more different hormones alter the normal female physiology.  For example, some 6-9% of adult women have the disorder known as polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS) making it the most common of all endocrinopathies. PCOS has a profound adverse impact on the health of many women since it commonly causes infertility, is associated with unhealthy body composition, and increases key risk factors for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The menopause transition is another example of changes in hormones secretion with resulting symptoms that might be mild, moderate or severe and lead to significant medical intervention. To study cycle abnormalities in a mathematical setting, this project will develop a model for a woman's reproductive life span. Using data sets from three consecutive age groups, three submodels will be integrated into one whole-life model represented by a system of delay differential equations with some slowly varying time-dependent coefficients. The resulting model will be the first endocrine system model which encompasses three time scales (days, months and years), with possible ensuing mathematical difficulties. For such systems, techniques for parameter identification and parameter sensitivity will be developed. The tools of dynamical systems such as stability, bifurcation and perturbation theories will be used to study model behavior.    Mathematical simulations will be used to investigate cycle abnormalities due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and to the menopause transition. These studies may help to identify subtle hormonal changes in the aging process and to predict optimal types, doses and durations of hormonal therapies for young and aging women.   In turn, given the broad consensus that hormone therapies be used at lowest doses for the shortest intervals necessary to achieve specifc therapeutic aims, the impact of these studies on women's health could be beneficial. A key ingredient for understanding PCOS is the relationship between the endocrine (hormone) system and the glucoregulatory (blood sugar) system.  A working model incorporating the hormonal imbalances of PCOS may illuminate the connections between excess androgens, insulin resistance and PCOS. Thus, in addition to applications to the treatment of infertility and menopause, this work may also advance our understanding of diabetes and metabolic disorders, the incidence of which has increased dramatically in recent years."

While social status differentials are common to all human societies, the origin of human status differentials remains unclear. What traits enable individuals to achieve higher status in a given culture, and what potential benefits motivate their status-seeking? Existing ethnographies of male status tend to explore the link between only one particular trait and social status, or lack a longitudinal design to properly assess causal relationships. Filling this knowledge gap in fast-disappearing small-scale societies is critical, in part because these societies provide unique insight into the ancestral socio-ecologies in which human status-seeking behavior originated.     The researcher will conduct 12 months of fieldwork among the Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of the Bolivian Amazon. Photo-ranking, interviews, medical exams, and collective action experiments will be used to compare several measures of social status (e.g. small-group leadership and community-wide influence), several determinants of status (e.g. age, hunting skill, personality, income, and number of close kin), and several outcomes of status acquisition (e.g. fertility and health). Data gathered in previous field seasons will be used to evaluate how investments in particular traits may or may not have led to subsequent status acquisition. Research will extend across four Tsimane villages, which differ in size and level of acculturation, such as access to education and material wealth.    This study represents one of the only quantitative analyses of social status to consider different determinants of status simultaneously and will be among the first to evaluate the health outcomes of social status in a non-industrial, small-scale society. The cross-village research design will provide a unique opportunity to investigate how socio-economic changes within a society shape the determinants and outcomes of social hierarchies. Funding this research also supports the education of a social scientist."

The study of implicit processes has been especially prevalent in the area of stereotyping and prejudice where researchers have determined that attitudes and associations activated implicitly may be consistent with or strikingly contradictory to attitudes activated explicitly.  For example, White people's explicit attitudes may lead them to espouse egalitarian and non-prejudiced attitudes toward African Americans. However, various cognitive, motivational and social processes can simultaneously lead to negative implicit attitudes and stereotypic associations in relation to African Americans. These associations have been linked to discriminatory outcomes in many domains, including education, psychological health, employment outcomes, medical care, and policing. Therefore, understanding how implicit biases can be changed is critically important not only for advances in our knowledge of attitudes, but also for reducing the pervasive consequences of implicit prejudice.      The purpose of the research in this grant is to improve understanding of the potential effectiveness of different strategies for changing implicit attitudes, the time course and persistence of change brought about through these strategies, as well as the underlying processes through which change may be achieved.  In addition, the research examines the effects of implicit bias reduction strategies on judgmental and evaluative behavioral outcomes in short and long term contexts, and with respect to interracial interactions. The first set of experiments examines the effectiveness of intergroup bias reduction strategies among Whites. The second set of experiments examines the effects of the change strategies on judgmental and evaluative behavioral outcomes.  The final set of experiments focuses on the outcomes of implicit bias change among members of stereotyped groups who have negative implicit biases related to their own group.  Ultimately, this research will advance current understanding of the interplay of automatic and controlled processes by providing and testing a framework of implicit bias change."

Under what conditions? Since 1989, nearly every country in the world has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, making it the most widely ratified treaty ever. The world has thus made a formal commitment to promote children's rights. This project assesses the impact of this formal commitment on the lives of children and identify the range of factors that work with international law to improve children's well-being.     International child-rights treaties may only be window dressing, designed to make countries look good but easily evaded. If this is true, other factors may also be necessary to encourage nation-states to live up to treaty obligations. Perhaps national laws promoting child rights, or the presence of child-rights interest groups within countries, are also essential. Where do global economic trends fit in? In the recent past, international financial institutions promoted the privatization of social services, requiring families to pay fees to use those services. This may have discouraged parents from sending children to school and or getting the children medical treatments. Global economic policies were also, until very recently, promoting the global flow of capital unhindered by borders or regulation. This could also affect child well-being, although more indirectly. This project will identify the many factors that facilitate or impede the implementation of international law.      To answer the questions posed, the researchers gather and code data on international and national child rights policies and international and national economic policies and characteristics. They also compile measures of several dimensions of child well-being over time for most countries in the world. These dimensions include child survival (e.g., health and mortality); child development (e.g., educational enrollments); equal opportunity for children regardless of race, creed, gender, etc.; and the integration of children?s best interests into policymaking. The researchers use these data in pooled time-series analyses to determine the circumstances under which international law is most effective. The comprehensive dataset constructed for this project will be made publicly available so that other researchers can answer related questions concerning child rights."

The research will be carried out in Israel, where female citizens have unparalleled access to assisted reproductive technologies enabling pregnancy at advanced (40-51 years) maternal age.    Doberne will conduct twelve months of ethnographic research in Tel Aviv, the hub of Israeli fertility medicine. Data collection will include participant observation in a fertility clinic and a hospital maternity unit; semi-structured interviews with patients, medical practitioners and relevant professionals; direct observations of medical conferences and online patient support groups; and analysis of popular representations of reproduction in media and other public sources.     This research examines the changing intersections of gender, technology, family, and aging, a site of emerging public health issues as women in many countries delay childbearing. By focusing particularly on later motherhood, this study will elucidate the wider effects of assisted reproductive technologies on such culturally-specific concepts of kinship and family. The researcher also will examine how accepting risk for pronatalist goals affects the meaning of technology in the context of nation-building.

A series of influential papers by Christopher Ruhm document that recessions are good for your health  or more specifically that state-level mortality rates are pro-cyclical. The magnitude of the correlation is economically meaningful: a typical estimate from the literature suggests that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate of a state is associated with a 0.54% reduction in the mortality rate of that state, which would translate into about 12,000 fewer deaths per year. This provocative finding immediately raises the question of what mechanisms are behind the relationship. Possibilities include: direct negative effects of employment such as occupational injuries or stress, changes in the opportunity cost of time associated with medical appointments or other time-intensive health promoting behaviors, changes in the consumption of goods that have negative health consequences, externalities associated with the business cycle, such as changes in pollution or traffic fatalities, and selective migration. At the same time, research linking individual job displacements to individuals own mortality finds that individuals who experience a job loss have higher probabilities of dying. These results would seem to be at odds with those based on state-level analyses, unless the increase in state level mortality rates that corresponds to improvements in the economy is mostly driven by factors external to changes in individuals own health behaviors.     The intellectual merit of this project is that it improves our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to pro-cyclical mortality. Particular emphasis is placed on disentangling effects that result from an individuals own behavior from changes that are related to externalities associated with economic fluctuations. This provides a key link to reconciling estimates produced by state-level and individual analyses. The broader impacts of the project lies in its implications for public policy: changes in the health of individuals that result from changes in their own behavior have different associated policy prescriptions than changes that result from external factors. In addition, the literature on the effects of job loss is rapidly expanding, and it is increasingly understood that the impact of job loss reaches much further than its impact on individuals own income. This project substantively advances the literature on job loss. A third broad impact of the project is that it adds to recent efforts to understand and measure the welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations.  It investigates these mechanisms by 1) estimating detailed mortality-unemployment rate correlations by age and cause of death, 2) estimating the effect of own group vs aggregate unemployment on group mortality, and 3) looking at cyclical changes in the quality and quantity of health care. In addition, it investigates the possibility that non-random migration plays a role in the connection between mortality and the business cycle, either by inducing mis-measurement of population denominators, or by generating compositional changes in the health distribution of states. Because the preliminary analyses suggest that most of the pro-cyclical relationship is driven by deaths among the elderly, the project focuses on understanding the cyclical nature of health care choices among the elderly (for example choosing to live at home vs. choosing nursing home care)."

The instrumentation will be used in various research projects on topics such as: 1) Global consequences of interruption of microbial population signaling pathways.  2) Analysis of fuel combustion products: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in airborne particulates. 3) DNA-binding properties of synthetic aziridinomitosenes. 4) Tyrosine-O-sulfation as a mechanism for stabilization of molecular interactions within the extracellular matrix during vertebrate skeletal development.  5) Environmental and health impacts of nanotechnology. 6) Identification of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands during cell cycle progression.     Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and to determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample.  A tandem mass spectrometer system is two mass spectrometers in series to better identify the constituents under study.  Chromatography is an isolation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis.  It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed and identified by the mass spectrometer.  These are some of the most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques used to identify and quantify the chemical composition of a sample. The LC-MS/MS would improve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students at Boise State University through its incorporation into lecture and laboratory work in advanced instrumentation, biophysics, and biochemistry.  Faculty and investigators at surrounding institutions, College of Idaho, Northwest Nazarene, the Boise Veterans Affairs Medical Center and State of Idaho labs will have access to the mass spectrometer system."

It is time to reconsider how we approach biology undergraduate education.  To this end the American Association for the Advancement of Science sponsored a series of conversations to enable a wide spectrum of the biological sciences community to provide insight into the changes that need to take place and how best to effect those changes.  The report from those conversations is being produced and will serve as the basis for this project, a major meeting of faculty, students, administrators, professional societies to address the need for change and exchange information concerning effective efforts to upgrade undergraduate biology so that the biology taught to undergraduates reflects the approaches and concepts current in the discipline and takes advantage of new teaching technologies and findings.  The published proceedings and the meeting itself are designed to produce an informed biology community and enhanced undergraduate education in the discipline, resulting in a transformative activity that engages a broad spectrum of the science community.    Intellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit of this project resides in the opportunity to have a vigorous discussion and exchange of information on ways to upgrade biology undergraduate education so that the content taught, the experiences offered to students and the pedagogy used truly represents the needs and resources of the 21st century.  The proceedings will provide a resource for those engaged in biology education but who could not attend the meeting itself.     Broader Impact: The broader impact of this project is in the diversity of the people who attend the conference, the diversity of the subdisciplines within biology and the institutions of higher education they represent, and the varied skills and experiences they bring to changes in approach to undergraduate education The dissemination plan includes both a printed and web based publication and is flexible enough to encompass other methods developed at the conference itself. In addition this meeting will include input from the three major funding agencies currently supporting advances in undergraduate education, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thus enlarging the scope of its influence."

The Phase I wearable device measures multiple noninvasive biosignals from a person in their daily home routine (or in the hospital), providing unprecedented visibility into health or disease status outside a critical care setting. The Phase II platform will comprise an ""ecosystem"" of software for providing automated, scalable intelligent monitoring of the signals from the device using advanced machine-learning algorithms, and exception-based alerting of medical staff upon early indication of deteriorating health of an ambulatory patient.     If successful this platform will provide a substantial improvement in the capability of the healthcare system to proactively manage the health of the large population of patients with costly chronic diseases. Current methods for remote (home) patient monitoring ""while better than a complete lack of monitoring"" involve extremely sparse data (once per day) and require proactive patient compliance to make manual measurements, typically of weight or blood pressure. These methods do not handle ambulatory variation; in contrast, the proposed algorithms uniquely detect health anomalies otherwise hidden in ambulatory variation. This Phase II project not only has the potential to fundamentally improve healthcare with continuous automated visibility into patient health in the home environment, but also stands to provide unique insight into new signatures of disease heretofore not recognized by medical science. The advanced detection algorithms are able to learn empirically the normal physiological variation (e.g., variations in blood pressure, metabolic activity, etc., throughout the day) of the human system, and reveal incipient anomalies from normal behavior which are not visible upon a plain, univariate inspection of the data. Moreover, the device itself provides data from human activities not customarily encountered in the static conditions of a medical facility, where patients are supine and sedated. It is highly likely that this new approach to multivariate analysis of human biosignals will unveil new signatures providing early warning of disease progression, for example, decompensation in a heart failure patient."

He will investigate the relationship between the politics of public health, psychiatric logic, and everyday experiences of self and mental illness. Disease categories are known to affect perception; the case of New Guinea allows a researcher to investigate these processes in new and dynamic situation while they are developing.    Preliminary research in New Guinea found that psychiatric practitioners often reformulate diagnostic categories, particularly those related to stress, to compete for resources with other, better known, medical needs such as the treatment of communicable diseases. The researcher will investigate the multiple effects of these efforts on the urban poor. He will carry out the research at two hospitals and a mental health rehabilitation center in Port Moresby. He will employ a combination of social science research methods, including: long-term participant observation, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, and the collection illness narratives.     This research will contribute to better understanding of how limitations on healthcare resources in the developing world impact those with less visible forms of disease, sometimes in ways that only become visible through micro-level social science research and analysis.  The project is timely because it also can contribute to discussions about whether or not contemporary global health initiatives adequately address mental illness prevalence in low and middle-income countries.

In doing so, it places these health seekers in the framework of contested racial, class, and gender ideologies informing turn-of-the-century society. It also seeks to establish whether and in what ways efforts to promote intangible qualities of health and climate helped to justify and encourage internal expansion in the American West, as well as the social and natural impacts of health seeking. Though perceptions of aridity, altitude, temperature, and sunshine often motivated western development and shaped its narratives, attitudes about health and landscape have been largely neglected in previous historical treatments of the settlement of this region.    This project draws from the methodologies and perspectives of environmental history, history of science, and social and cultural history. It utilizes archival and organizational records of various booster organizations and health colonies, personal and family papers, popular periodicals, as well as journals, monographs, and records of medical and scientific groups, particularly in the field of medical climatology. It places these varied sources in dialogue with one another across three uniquely western landscapes?the desert Southwest, Rocky Mountains, and Southern California Coast. The resulting dissertation will establish why multiple discourses depicted certain western environments as healthful and beneficial to the body, and how these beliefs were shaped by diverse populations and contributed to fashioning an American identity."

Dr. Joyce V. Millen of Willamette University will undertake a three-year research and educational program to advance understanding of African diaspora-driven health philanthropy in the context of Africa's acute shortage of medical personnel. She will compare two migratory linkages: (1) between Senegal and France and (2) between Ghana and the United States. The research is designed to follow the circulatory trajectories of Senegalese and Ghanaian associations and health professionals from host countries of employment to countries of origin.     The researcher and her colleagaues will conduct ethnographic research among a select sample of Senegalese and Ghanaian diaspora associations in France and the United States.  They will document the networks and processes through which these associations articulate with state and multilateral agencies in their efforts to transfer medical skills and health resources to their countries of origin. They will collect life history interviews among individual Senegalese and Ghanaian medical providers in the diaspora to ascertain on migration, work, and philanthropic efforts. The histories will provide data to assess whether class, duration away from homeland, and level of connectivity with homeland, among other variables, are predictive of diaspora philanthropic engagement. The last year of the study will culminate with ethnographic research in the Senegalese and Ghanaian towns identified in the first phases of research as recipient communities of diaspora-led efforts. The aim of this last phase of research is to ascertain how the medical philanthropic projects are being implemented and received locally.     The educational component of the program employs a novel collaborative model that enables select American students to conduct ethnographic research in direct collaboration with African counterpart students from universities in Senegal and Ghana. The findings of this research will bring needed critical analysis to bear on current received wisdom regarding the potentials of ""diasporas for development."" The study will also bring empirically-grounded anthropological insights to broader disciplinary debates on transnationalism and deterritorialized citizenries."

First, it develops activity monitoring with accelerometers as an innovative and non-invasive method for estimating energy expenditure in human ecology field studies. Second, it explores the relationship of energy expenditure profiles in adolescent females in a subsistence agricultural society to body composition and pubertal maturation. Third, it investigates whether the relationship between energy expenditure and adolescent development is modified by early life energy availability.    The project takes advantage of a unique opportunity in The Gambia to directly address the effects of early life factors in a human population where differences in maternal energetic status during pregnancy are known. Between 1989 and 1994, the British Medical Research Council gave standardized nutritional supplements to a sub-set of pregnant women in the West Kiang District. This project follows up both the children of both supplemented and unsupplemented individuals to investigate the interaction of developmental and current energetic conditions on adolescent development.    Broader Impact: Populations in developing nations show evidence of a shift over time toward sedentism and associated health problems, including obesity and diabetes. This study will help to establish a field technique capable of generating high-quality, comparative data on energy expenditure with minimal invasiveness and low cost. It will quantify energy expenditure in activity in a subsistence agricultural population and its relation to body composition and pubertal progression, providing an important comparison for urban industrial settings. It will constitute a rare randomized test of the impact of prenatal conditions on adolescent physiology and development. Furthermore, it will build capacity in an undergraduate research assistant, who will participate in data collection and complete a senior thesis, and in three Gambian field assistants in the West Kiang District, who will be learn accelerometer techniques. This doctoral dissertation research project will also provide training and development opportunities for a female graduate student."

The approach is using novel ultrasonic data-communication devices and electronics. In wireless sensor and tag networks for ambient intelligence, structural and asset monitoring and personal health monitoring, sensing tags employ wake-up receivers to monitor requests for information from the central control node. These always-ON devices need to operate with extremely low power to save battery life or enable operation from energy scavenged from the environment.     The proposed ultrasonic data communication technologies offer two orders of magnitude of power reduction over current radio communication-based solutions. A novel technology platform combining flexible polymer piezoelectrics and integrated circuits will enable miniature ultrasonic transducers. These advances can also enable significant advances in proximity sensing, ranging, and communications through a variety of media with applications in automation, ambient intelligence and medical diagnostics and health monitoring, where radio transmission is poor or interference is not acceptable.      The use of sensor and tagging networks is still in its infancy and the proposed research and education program will offer new technology and human capital to apply these technologies for the benefit of society. The graduate and undergraduate education and outreach activities of this cross-disciplinary program help train the next generation of researchers in ultra-low power electronics, device microfabrication and integration, and sensor networks. Ultrasound communication and localization modules will be developed with the Harlem Robotics League, a community outreach program for public high school students from underrepresented minority groups in Harlem."

Multi-core and many-core chip and processor designs promise significant breakthroughs in computing platform performance that are used in critical applications in our daily lives. Such computing technologies and designs require the rethinking of power delivery technologies by defining new research directions and activities to improve energy efficiency, improve performance, and reduce size and cost. These applications, for example, include medical applications, complex weather simulations, virtual reality and advanced graphics, video conferencing, manufacturing processes controls, engineering complex analysis, education and entertainment. Such applications impact peoples' daily life, scientific advancement, economical growth, health, safety and security.    Intellectual Merits: Recent chip and processor designs have started to utilize few cores and currently are powered using conventional power delivery technologies, which may be sufficient for now even though not optimum, until the research in this area advances. Future chip and processor designs are expected to include tens and hundreds of cores that can be homogeneous and/or heterogeneous with multiple non-uniform workloads. This will result in the power delivery system being subjected to highly varying and unpredictable power demands thus impacting energy efficiency and dynamic performance.  This research addresses these challenges by developing an integrated simulation platform including efficiency model(s), dynamic response model(s) and homogeneous and heterogeneous many-core loading profiles model(s) that will be used to investigate and rethink power delivery design for many-core platforms. Based on the preliminary results obtained from the developed simulation platform, a reconfigurable research platform will also be developed that includes different power converter topologies, and programmable control and power management implementations supporting multiple heterogeneous and homogeneous many-core workloads.    Broader Impacts: The research activities and related educational activities are designed to attract the participation of engineers from all segments of the engineering community, including those from underrepresented and minority groups such as women and African Americans, to the area of power delivery and energy systems management especially as applied to the state-of-the-art and future computing platforms that has an impact on wide range of applications and markets. Research and educational activities include research presentations and seminars at selected Historically Black Colleges and Universities institutions, the University of Alabama Student Introduction to Engineering program, and the organization of a Many-Core Power Delivery Open House Day involving industry, students, and persons from underrepresented groups. The results will also be disseminated through refereed publications and through a new course for many-core power delivery designs that will be developed and disseminated."

This project will develop novel methods to more efficiently capture and communicate this activity in environments that currently rely on human observation, verbal communication, and collective memory. More efficient teamwork capture processes will enable both larger-scale collection (which supports retrospective analysis that is critical for improved training and technology design) and contemporaneous collection (which provides real-time feedback to workers to assist in error detection).     To achieve these goals, domain-specific knowledge and probabilistic reasoning will be used to identify patterns of work and communication. The representative domain of trauma resuscitation is ideal for this work since the roles and tasks of players are well-defined and the flow of work follows a general schema regardless of the patient?s injuries. Because of the complexity of this environment, manual tracking of all activities using video recordings requires repeated review and is very time-consuming even for experienced observers. A computer system will be developed that uses video analysis to determine the location of each player, motion analysis to track their movements, and speech recognition targeted at a limited lexicon to identify their communication. Using these inputs, a probabilistic reasoning model will be constructed that correlates data from the environment with a domain-specific model of teamwork. The tagged recording of the resuscitation event will be available in real time during the event as well as post-event for analysis.     The scientific importance of this work is in the need to tag these video observations. Many forms of videos are of repetitive behaviors, whether in surveillance applications, work situations, or other uses. In all such cases, applying a grammar to the video, and matching actions and sounds to that grammar, has the possibility of greatly simplifying work analysis, which is the critical phase in the development computer support for complex, high-risk human activities.     The proposed approach will develop novel algorithms and methods for: (i) person and resource tracking in crowded collaborative environments; (ii) recognition of human activity based on fusion of unreliable data from multimodal sensors and a model of the process being recorded; and (iii) reasoning about human activities at different time scales based on heterogeneous technologies (Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian Nets, and Petri Nets) that mutually interact for activity and event detection. Moreover, the methods will be developed and evaluated in a clinical environment that currently uses limited information technology.     Broader Impacts. This work will also provide the foundation for implementing decision aids in environments such as trauma resuscitation and related medical domains that lack effective methods for instrumented tracking of teamwork.

Intellectual Merit: This project lays the foundation for a systematic continuation of the PI?s prior NSF and NASA funded research in e-medicine (for sub-Saharan Africa) and multimedia instructional technologies. Using these funding sources, the PI and his team have implemented and assessed e-medicine technologies in developing nations in sub-Saharan Africa, and rural Louisiana. Further, they have been funded to develop multimedia instructional technologies to bring real world information technology issues to the classroom. The project completion depends on disciplines relying on one another, and the collaboration of US and Cameroonian universities and medical institutions. The two-day workshop will focus on two measurable objectives: (i) To bring together a suite of international collaborators who are engaged in student learning and research, and to use the dynamic of our interaction to develop the human capacity of all participants and that of participating institutions; (ii) To establish specific practical steps towards active research collaborations, in terms of journal and conference publications, collaborations between students and faculty from participating institutions.    Broader Impacts: Cameroon demonstrates the relative resource poverty, and characteristic uncertainties as with all developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The need for affordable and accessible health care services in the country is critical. However, the primary challenge is lack of well-trained medical health professionals, and exodus of new graduates to richer countries. The projects to be discussed at the proposed workshop will lay the foundation for a several publications and certifications in e-medicine for participating institutions as well as broader dissemination of existing funded grants.

This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase 1 project will research and develop continuous micro stereo lithography as an enabling manufacturing platform of biocompatible, multifunctional material structures and systems such as plastic fiber microarray plates. These plates will have important advantages over existing glass fiber microarray plates: the platform of choice for biochips, microtiter plates, micro and picowell plates, microfluidic arrays and microcapillary arrays. The glass fibers have been extensively used to perform optical readout of fluorescence signals indicative of specific biochemical reactions. Use of special polymers will give the plastic fibers numerical apertures of up to unity, which has never been reached previously and will give the highest possible sensitivity. Because of the use of lithography, the plastic optical fiber arrays will have 0.1 micron position alignment compared to a few microns for glass fibers. This major difference in alignment accuracy will be increasingly important as array densities increase and size of fluorescent light sources decrease. The manufacturing cost of plastic fiber array plates are  shown to be an order of magnitude less than for glass microarrays.  Different types of microarray plates will be fabricated, characterized and tested for multifunctional biological assays and ultrasound imaging for biometric identification.    Principal societal benefits from this project will be improvements in health care and national security. Improved biotechnologies will include: gene sequencing, proteomics, disease diagnostics, drug discovery and agriculture. These fields can benefit from the improved accuracy and lower cost microarray technology. Investments at the University of Florida in state of the art lithography and molecular biology equipment will be leveraged by using these facilities and collaborating with expert Faculty and students. The first commercial microarray products resulting from this project will be used in existing gene sequencing equipment and medical diagnostic arrays. The annual sales for glass microarray products in these market segments are $30M and growing at 25% per year. There will be a total $20M market in plastic fiber microarray plates for the ultrasound biometric market and Night Vision market.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop nanoconstructs with catalytic activity which is controllable via an external trigger. Nanoscale metal oxides have unique properties that will be leveraged to change the catalytic activity. Nanoalloys composed of domains of free radical generators and domains of free radical scavengers can be designed to limit catalytic activity until an external control is provided, stimulating changes in the chemical structure and enhancing the catalytic activity of one domain over the other. The ability to switch the catalytic activity will enable several applications to be developed, including medical therapies. The synthesis and characterization of nanoconstructs with controllable catalytic activity and demonstration of switching capability under external stimulation will be developed. Catalytic activity of the nanoconstructs will be characterized as a function of pH, illumination, and temperature. Measurements will be correlated with composition uniformity, average composition, size, and defect concentration. As ceria is a phosphor used in solid state lighting, a secondary objective is to apply the same techniques to increase efficiency, tune the wavelength, or alter the fluorescence lifetime.    The broader impact/commercial potential will be the development of externally switchable catalysts that are large and the applications varied. Applications would include health care applications, solid state lighting, solar cell, bio-chemical sensing, and remotely triggerable catalysts. The ability to switch the nanoparticle's free radical scavenging and generating behavior will have an enormous impact on the field of nanobiotechnology and may become a necessary property to minimize the toxicity of nanoparticles uptaken in the body. Markets for selective killing of cancer cells or bacteria are potentially multi-million dollar industries. The nanoconstructs can be incorporated as phosphors into new or existing solid state lighting fixtures to improve efficiency as well as achieve desired modifications of the spectral output and light modulation. Other potential applications could include the development of water-based catalysts that can self-clean to eliminate biofouling for near room-temperature fuel cell designs, or remote biochemical sensing. Beneficiaries of the technology will be a wounded soldier, a factory worker using circadian lighting to stay alert on third shift, users of improved batteries, solar cells, or antibacterial bandages."

This research explores the potential and multiple risks of suicide for Native (Yup'ik) Alaskan soldiers and veterans returning from the Middle East war theatre as they reintegrate into their rural isolated communities located in  the Yukon - Kuskokwim Delta of southwest Alaska. Native Alaskan communities in general  - and Yup'ik communities in particular - have some of the highest suicide rates of anywhere in the United States and young Native men are at the greatest risk (Perkins 2006). Insofar as veterans from the Middle East war theatre are committing suicide at an alarming rate these Native soldiers/ veterans are returning to a doubly charged social and emotional landscape (Tanielian, 2008). Moreover, two of the primary factors that can inhibit soldiers and veterans from obtaining the needed behavioral and mental health services are access to care and willingness to seek care.     The exploratory study has three key objectives; first, to investigate the multiple strategies utilized by Native soldiers and veterans to negotiate this dual risk environment. Secondly, to examine the particular ways in which the struggles that some of these young Native men face affect their everyday lived experience, that is social relations with their families, their peers and their community.  Lastly, to explore under what circumstances these young Native adults may or may not choose to seek help for what has been characterized as the ""invisible wounds of war"" (Tanielian, 2008).     The researcher's hypothesis is that without a culturally - sensitive, community - based modality of care - a middle ground - that can serve as a bridge between not seeking any care at all, ie., ""going it alone"" and actively engaging with evidenced based medical care for suicide ideation and associated problems of depression, PTSD, substance abuse, these Native soldiers/veterans in rural communities are doubly at risk for suicide as they are isolated - not only from their military peers ( Messinger 2008) - but also from their families and their community (Lifton, 1973; Appendix C). This study seeks to understand what the parameters of that middle ground might look like that is at once socially, culturally and historically contextualized.    This phase of the research contributes to our understanding of the complexity of the social and emotional problems faced by these young Native Alaska soldier/veterans in new ways that allows for more in depth insights usually missed by more prosaic community research methods. Although many community studies have now incorporated an ethnographic component into their research design, it is usually delimited by rapid response techniques, which usually involved a stay in village a week or so, thus mitigating an understanding of a locally lived social lives embedded within local history. This study not only explores the lived experiences of individuals at risk for suicide, but places them within the context of their families, their history, their community and their culture. In doing so both the strengths as well as the vulnerabilities of such emerge that may map new ways to reach and reach out to people in such circumstances."

Although the conventional wisdom is that lead in school water poses little health risk, substantive gaps in understanding may have caused the magnitude of this problem to be underestimated. The combination of ""worst case"" plumbing configurations and water flow patterns, and susceptible populations of very young children, makes a detailed evaluation of this issue desirable.     Three phases of research are directed at resolving the most important issues. The first examines key aspects of lead occurrence in potable water of schools using intensive sampling events designed to statistically characterize the natural variability of lead in water. A similar analysis will be conducted for selected ""problem"" taps that are known to dispense hazardous waste levels of lead with at least some frequency. The level of lead in hot water will also be systematically tested for the first time. Sampling protocols are designed to ensure that none of the lead in water is ""missed"", as often occurs when using conventional lead in water analytical procedures and guidance. The occurrence of high lead in water will then be forensically linked to specific plumbing sources using an array of analytical techniques.     The second phase of work systematically evaluates the bioavailability of the lead. It has been speculated that the particulate lead in water is not bioavailable and poses little health risk, but on the other hand several recent cases of lead poisoning for children were unambiguously tied to the presence of small particles of lead solder in the water. Samples of particulate lead from water of schools will be exposed to a range of representative simulated gastric acids, churn conditions, and stomach retention times. Lead dissolution will be tracked in samples as a function of particle size and type of lead particle present. Tests will also be conducted to examine partitioning of particulate lead in water to pasta during cooking, and the role of trace reducing agents in gastric acid in rendering particulate lead more or less bioavailable. This fundamental research has not been previously conducted for lead particulates derived from real drinking waters.     Finally, bio-kinetic models will be utilized that incorporate results of the first two phases of research, in order to evaluate a range of realistic exposure scenarios by which children might be exposed to lead in water while in schools. Prior modeling efforts were significantly biased towards underestimating the elevation in blood lead that might result from exposure to lead contaminated drinking water. This modeling work will be the first to: 1) consider acute as well as chronic health risks, 2) evaluate the potential hazard that arises from use of hot water for instant infant formula, soups, and tea (it is suspected that there is often much more lead in hot water than cold water), and 3) determine the possible contribution of lead in foods cooked in contaminated water.     This research work is a collaborative effort between Virginia Tech, the Children?s National Medical Center (CNMC), the Alliance for Healthy Homes, Parents for Non-toxic Alternatives, and a network of concerned parents and high school students/teachers. Results will be used in considering the protectiveness of existing approaches that are used to control and mitigate lead hazards in potable water of schools and homes. Our unfunded preliminary efforts have already had a significant effect, as evidenced by tougher standards in the State of Washington and in Canada, and through a re-evaluation of effects of high lead in water on blood lead of children in Washington D.C. from 2001-2007. These initial successes, interdisciplinary approach, and clear public health implications support the need for the research."

Together, immobilized cells and EPS form a biofilm. Reports from many water utilities in the US have shown that biofilm survives in water distribution systems despite the continuing presence of disinfectants and causes significant health threats to the public. Currently, the persistence of biofilm in water distribution systems is believed to be strongly related to EPS. The principal objective of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms of the persistence of biofilm in water distribution systems. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the role of biofilm EPS, using microelectrodes techniques and fluorescently labeled probes for in-situ biofilm monitoring.     The proposed studies with microelectrodes techniques and biofilm analysis tools will broaden our understanding of pathogenic biofilm formation and its control with disinfectants. Specifically, this research will enable quantitative evaluation of the role of EPS and biofilm structure on the transport and reaction of disinfectants. This will result in the development of modeling parameters obtained with microelectrodes and biofilm analysis. In addition, we will identify the role of EPS on pathogen attachment, detachment and redistribution. Finally, this research will result in combined assessments of the effects of multiple distribution parameters (water age, reactive pipe material, phosphorous corrosion inhibitor) on multi-species biofilm growth. This research has new key approaches which can be differentiated from previous studies. First, the unanswered transport and reaction kinetics of secondary disinfectants in biofilm will be determined with newly developed microelectrodes and in-situ biofilm analysis. Second, a systematic approach will be used to observe the role of EPS on the detachment and redistribution of biofilm, monitoring physiological states of detached clusters which couldn't be understood with particle size analyzers.     Beyond enlarging our understanding of biofilm control in academic society, the proposed research has direct and broad impacts on water utilities, industries, and public health. The information gleaned from this research will enable local water utilities to incorporate biofilm control strategies and enhance our current understanding of biofilm control mechanism in many other industries including medical and chemical industries. The outcomes will contribute to protecting public health by improving the prevention of biofilm related pathogen infection via drinking water and providing a fundamental understanding of the role of EPS against antimicrobial agents. In addition, the proposed project will result in the training and education of two Ph.D students, summer research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students, and implementation of research findings into PIs three undergraduate courses."

The instrument is essential in advancing current and planned research at CPSS in such areas as 1) health and environmental safety and chemical reactivity of nanoparticles (NPs); 2) greener chemicals for industries; 3) new silicone surfactants and polymers with enhanced performance. Among current projects in the Department of Earth and Environment Engineering and other departments which would also definitely benefit from the use of Raman are: 1) carbon dioxide sequestration, alternative energy, gas separation membranes; 2) biocolloid engineering for medical applications in molecular imaging and targeted therapy; 3) determination of geological processes through identification of dissolved volatiles in high silica magmas, identification of mineral phases in multi-micron sized inclusions within host crystals; 4) new nanoelectronical systems; unique electronic, rotational, vibrational and spin interactions between an incarcerated guest molecules with the inner concave walls of a C60 host.

The development of an alternate transplant site which could be conditioned by the localized administration of anti-inflammatory agents, and/or other compounds to induce neovascularization could facilitate use of fewer islets and consistent islet graft success using a single donor pancreas. Toward this end, the proposed research will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which sphingosine1-phosphate (S1P) receptor subtype signaling regulates adult microvascular remodeling in diabetic animal models. Diabetes is a well known and significant risk factor in the development of vascular disease, and diabetes is known to impair new blood vessel formation and endogenous neovascularization of ischemic tissue. Therefore, the proposed research specific aims will address the overarching hypothesis that selective pharmacological activation of S1P receptor subtypes S1P1 and S1P3 induces formation of mature microvascular networks in diabetic animals by promoting recruitment and proliferation of upstream mural support cells (smooth muscle cells and pericytes) on arteriole microvessels. Aim 1 will determine the role of selectively induced S1P1/S1P3 signaling during pharmacological induction of arteriogenesis in diabetic mouse dorsal skinfold window chambers; Aim 2 will determine the role of selective S1P1/S1P3 signaling during tissue ischemia and consequent arteriolar remodeling in diabetic mice using in a spinotrapezius model. The intellectual merit of the proposal concerns how selective activation of S1P receptor subtypes by engineered S1P receptor targeted compounds can be utilized to locally suppress early inflammatory events and induce neovascularization and topics critical to improving pancreatic islet transplant success. Moreover, as many significant aging associated diseases arise from impaired or abnormal function of microvasculature, the development of effective strategies to promote formation of mature microvascular networks is a critically important medical need with potential for transformative broader impact on treatment of many important diseases. Integrated education activities will emphasize cultivation and advising of integrated Capstone Design teams to 1) establish multiple peer-to-peer relationship that cross ethnic, cultural, and economic boundaries, 2) give students an appreciation for the impact that TE/RM applications can make on human health worldwide. A short course in regenerative medicine will also be developed and taught at the University of Ghana to cultivate greater participation in new ""globally distributed design"" teams within the NSF-sponsored BME Planet Network."

In humans, the compromised immunity with aging is realized in an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections, reactivation of latent viruses, and decreased responses to vaccines. It is well known that the adaptive immune system such as T and B-cell progressively deteriorate with advancing age. Cytokines are secreted regulatory proteins and play vital roles in controlling cell survival, growth differentiation and function.    The multi-disciplinary and tri-institutional ""Linked Collaborative Research- Interdisciplinary Proposal"" brings together several research groups with broad expertise and research interest to conduct experimental and theoretical studies aimed at engineering of novel nanostructures for sensing and high resolution imaging of cytokines. The group at the University of Michigan lead by Dr. Kotov will carry out the materials and nanotechnology aspect of this project, while the investigation at the University of Texas Medical Branch lead by Dr. Motamedi will concentrate on imaging and proteomics of this work. The experimental efforts of these groups will be complemented by the theoretical and modeling efforts of Dr. Govorov at Ohio University who will be developing models capable of predicting the response of the sensors. Specifically, they propose a novel sensing nanotechnology to image cytokines gradient of macrophages for the immunosenescence study of innate immune system. Successful demonstration of the versatile NW superstructure with cytokine-dependent frequency shift during the next three years allocated for this proposal will establish a concept and protocol for sensing and imaging of various cytokines while providing a unique opportunity to characterize the secretion of various cytokines from different age groups of macrophages, and developing the fundamental foundation for engineering of a new class of optical sensor for detection and imaging of various proteins.    Broader Impact    The proposed work is inherently multidisciplinary. The project combines expertise in new materials, imaging, bioengineering, biophysics and modeling as well as proteomics. From educational point of view, PIs, and graduate students will be immersed into a highly diverse environment, learning to interact and communicate effectively with professionals in several different fields of science and engineering. Special attention will be given to providing research opportunities to undergraduates and minority. The goals and scope of the interdisciplinary research (IDR) program at NSF appear to be an exact match for the proposed research. The joint efforts of the proposed multi-disciplinary team will create a powerful tool for the fundamental understanding of cell biology, characterization of proteomics of many diseases, clinical diagnosis of cell-secretion related diseases and the potential for rational control of cell differentiation in tissue engineering using novel optical sensors to detect and monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of small molecules such cytokines using high resolution imaging techniques. The proposed research combines the synergistic activities of a chemist and engineer with expertise in material sciences, nanotechnology, nanophotonics and sensing (Dr. Kotov, U of M), a bioengineering team specializing in cellular and biomedical imaging working with internationally known expert in the area of proteomics and inflammatory responses (Dr. Motamedi and his collaborators at UTMB) and a biophysicist and modeler with expertise in modeling of complex nanostructure and their behavior. The proposed joint efforts will significantly advance fundamental knowledge in multiple engineering and life science areas, including sensing, imaging and proteomics and if successful could have enormous long-term impact on health care and our national needs."

Currently, management protocols for monitoring blood glucose in the hospital setting are overly simplistic and often ineffective. An interdisciplinary team consisting of a diabetologist/endocrinologist and a control engineer seeks to improve the regulation of blood glucose levels in patients in the intensive care setting, especially those who are there postoperatively. The current insulin dosing protocols are actually feedback control algorithms for blood glucose levels, but little work has been done to analyze them as such. The central theme of this proposal is that feedback control techniques can lead to better performing and safer insulin dosing protocols. The PIs will build and validate a dynamic model of blood glucose response to intravenous insulin infusion rate that is adapted to various classes of patients seen in the ICU. The model will be based on patient data and will account for important perturbing factors such as dextrose infusion rates, nutrition (oral and parenteral), insulin resistant or sensitizing drugs, patient body temperature and clinical severity when entering the ICU. They will perform an extensive control analysis of existing insulin infusion protocols in closed-loop with the obtained dynamic model, with an emphasis on studying their nominal response as well as their response to a wide range of model parameter variations. On the basis of the model building and closed-loop control analysis performed above, the PIs will propose improvements to the existing protocols, including the so-called paper protocols that are employed in hospitals worldwide, which reflect a superior control law.    Intellectual Merit:     There have been no published comparisons of various protocols for such factors as rapidity and consistency of reaching targets or frequency of hypoglycemia. Neither has there been a systematic study of robustness of the existing protocols to patient variations such as nutrition (especially carbohydrates), changing vasopressors, steroids and other drugs. Published protocols claim between 46 to 69 % of blood glucose levels reach goal. Hypoglycemia rates can range from 0.3 to 15 % in several studies. A protocol that could bring blood glucose levels to goal quickly, respond appropriately and in a timely manner to changing insulin resistance/sensitivity, and address meals and drug regimes would have a significant impact on patient care. Preempting hypoglycemia by automatically noting the changing insulin sensitivity could address the fear of low blood glucose levels. In an unresponsive sedated patient, this would help minimize the concern for hypoglycemia which is the biggest barrier to the use of insulin. Lastly the ideal protocol in addition to addressing all the above issues would allow the health care provider to titrate a different blood glucose range and sensitivity for patients in different ICU settings (medical, surgical, cardiac, or trauma burn), minimize blood glucose swings with meals or infusions containing dextrose, and prevent hypoglycemia. The work proposed here will take us a significant step toward this goal.    Broader Impacts:     The general principles developed by this research should be transferable to the outpatient management of diabetes where the scope is of an enormous magnitude and a variety of other settings, including anesthesia and pain management."

Critical wetting is the property of a two-fluid system where the relative wettability of the solid container, described by the contact angle of a liquid on the solid, and the shape of the container determine whether the liquid will form a finite-height single-valued static interface in a container. 3D models will track conditions where the critical wetting phenomenon lacks the solid mathematical foundation and experimental verification that exists for critical wetting in two-dimensional cylindrical containers. Failure to properly predict critical wetting leads to reduced performance or failure in devices or systems that rely on capillary fluid physics when the liquid remains in one region or the liquid wicks away to another region. Both behaviors are important in numerous small-scale fluids systems operating today and envisioned for the future. Predicting such conditions is important for proper two-phase fluid system operations, such as for water management in small fuel cell channels, pulmonary health, MEMS-based medical and other instrumentation, and liquid propulsion systems. The planned experiment will be one of the first to fly in the emerging commercial sub-orbital rocket flight industry. It will deliver results that cannot be obtained by other methods and will deliver these results far faster and cheaper than through traditional sub-orbital rocket test programs. Locally, the impact will be through the impact that this NSF-funded research will have on undergraduate opportunities at Purdue. Past research advances of this research area publicized by Purdue News Service have generated positive news of international scope. This experimental program will show how the emerging sub-orbital rocket industry may be effectively used for critical research for the near future."

An important motivation for the GRC/GRS is the fact that as a new scientific discipline, Oceans and Human Health does not have a forum to facilitate interactions and dialogue among the scientists and students involved in relevant research. The significance of the field is reflected by ongoing support of oceans and human health research by the National Science Foundation. The topics to be discussed in the second Oceans and Human Health GRC/GRS are:  Session Topics: Ocean Pharmacopia, Recreational Waters,  Modeling and Prediction, Practical Applications of ""Omics"",  (R)evolution in Seafood Safety,  Oceans and Human Health International, Cyanobacteria, and Oceans in a Warmer World.    Broader Impacts:  Through formal presentations, poster sessions and informal interactions between scientists and students, the conference will:  (1) assemble the highest caliber of academic, government and industrial scientists and students to examine recent developments in the fields of Oceans and Human Health and review the latest pertinent research in algal and microbial biology, physical and biological oceanography, epidemiology and public health, genomics and proteomics, toxicology, pharmacology, and economics; (2) foster the open exchange of information and ideas among scientists at the cutting edge of Oceans and Human Health research by providing opportunities for participants to interact in a relaxed and friendly environment; and (3) 3ngage female, minority and junior faculty and students (postdoctoral and graduate) in the field of Oceans and Human Health research through participation at formal sessions, poster presentations and informal interactions. The Graduate Research Seminar in Oceans and Human Health is targeted specifically at mentoring students in this new emerging discipline. Information concerning these meetings will be broadly disseminated through professional societies and by personal contact. Minority participants will be sought by advertising and personal contact at minority and other institutions."

This project will address this divide through a novel approach that employs conversational agent technology to reduce the critical cognitive and social-psychological barriers hindering older users in web-based consumer environments. The goal of this project is to broaden the engagement of the growing yet underrepresented senior population in Internet technology, a medium that can dramatically improve their quality of life. This goal closely aligns with the human-centered computing objective of transforming the human-computer interaction experience through the development of systems that are aware of the abilities and special needs of people that use them. Research on animated pedagogical agents has revealed promising results on the effectiveness of agents in learning and motivation. However, no previous research program has investigated how agent technology can be designed to promote autonomy and empowerment in the older population, particularly in web-based consumer environments, involving multi-dimensional information processing and complex decision-making. To address this critical gap in the research, this project will systematically investigate, three aspects of agent interactions with older users: 1) locus of control (agent vs. user), 2) interactional style (functional vs. relational), and 3) modality of exchange (unimodal-voice vs. unimodal-text vs. dualmodal-voice + text). This research program will apply a multi-phase, mixed-methods approach involving qualitative studies in the first phase, and a series of controlled experiments with over 400 older users in subsequent phases.  The purpose is to examine the effectiveness of the three aspects of agent-user interaction in: 1) reducing cognitive barriers (reducing information load, increasing navigation convenience, enhancing information search and retrieval ease), 2) reducing social-psychological barriers (enhancing control and efficacy, increasing trust, enhancing perception of social support), and 3) increasing Internet technology use intent. The experimental studies will further determine whether users' gender, visual or hearing impairments, and prior Internet competency interact with the three aspects of agent-user interaction to affect the desired outcomes. The findings from this project will generate new knowledge on how multimodal systems employing conversational agents can be designed for the abilities and special needs of older users leading to a potentially transformative and empowering experience for this underrepresented population in information technology.    Seniors are increasingly finding the necessity to engage in web-based consumer environments (e.g., online banking, shopping, trading, travel reservations). While the functionality of agents in these domains merits examination, the broader significance of this project lies in its ability to inform the development of agent-mediated interfaces for other applications such as websites that provide important health and medical information to seniors. Anecdotal evidence gathered by the project team from a prototype system has revealed the transformative potential of this technology for older users. This pilot research funded by the Office of Outreach at Auburn University, has extended the impact of this project to constituents in the state of Alabama. In addition to research, outreach will also serve as an important mission in the dissemination of future findings from this project to stakeholders at local and national levels. With the goal of enhancing diversity in research and education, this project will also involve a greater representation of African-American (AA) study participants from surrounding counties in Alabama, and actively engage AA graduate students, who are already part of the PI's lab in the educational goal of this project. This project will further enhance the infrastructure for research and education across two disciplines through an interdisciplinary seminar course will be offered to graduate students in computer science and consumer affairs to enhance the understanding of the future researchers on how humans perceive and use computing artifacts such as conversational agents."

Unfortunately, these ecosystems are being degraded worldwide due to infectious disease, human activities, and climate change.  Poorly studied members of this rapidly deteriorating ecosystem are the Bacteria and Archaea.  Although recent studies have made progress toward our understanding of coral-associated microbial communities, there are substantial areas that have not been explored.  Since these coral reef ecosystems are at risk, it is important to assess microbial biodiversity before habitat destruction worsens.  Their two key objectives for the NSF Biodiversity Survey and Inventories proposal are to (1) survey microbial diversity associated with three different coral species collected from two sites in the Caribbean, and (2) disseminate this information in an online database while promoting education and training of students and junior personnel.  Samples of coral mucus, coral tissue, and background seawater will be analyzed to distinguish the microbial communities uniquely associated with each sample type.  They will take both a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach to the survey. Carbon source utilization patterns and DNA fingerprinting approaches (e.g., denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, 16S rDNA cloning) will be used to characterize whole communities.  Microbial isolates will be characterized in terms of cell morphology and motility, growth characteristics, antibiotic resistance patterns, production of cell-signaling molecules, and phylogeny.  The data obtained will be channeled into a public, online database that will be developed by all members of the research team for the purposes of disseminating and sharing of information regarding coral microbial communities among the broader scientific community.   Educational opportunities at the high school, undergraduate  (through two NSF undergraduate research programs), graduate, and postdoctoral levels will be incorporated into each stage of the proposed project.  All members of the research team will work cooperatively in a very dynamic setting to both collect and evaluate the data, as well as contribute to website development and database design.  They will also develop a special topics course to be offered each summer of the proposed project entitled ""Coral Biology:  The Complex Role of Microorganisms in Coral Health and Disease.""  The proposed work will foster collaboration between two US-based educational institutions (Medical Univ. of South Carolina, Univ. of South Carolina-Aiken,), The Institute for Genomic Research (TGIR), and an international organization, the Colombian Institute for Marine and Coastal Research (INVEMAR)."
