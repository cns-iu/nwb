Unlike scientific visualizations, KDVs are created from data that have no spatial reference, such as publications, patents, or grants.  The research component of this project comprises the setup of an advanced, open architecture, computing infrastructure for KDV education and research as well as the development and comprehensive evaluation of algorithms for incremental and scalable data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and spatial layout. Cartographic principles are employed to facilitate the use of skills traditionally associated with geographic maps for the exploration of KDVs.   The education plan includes the development of an Information Visualization Data and Software Repository that together with associated Learning Modules provides public access to and training for existing and newly developed IV and KDV software. The value of KDVs for educational purposes, e.g., to equip students with a \"big picture\" or global view of teaching material, is explored.  The project will make KDVs available as a new information access and management tool that has the potential to dramatically improve the communication of scientific results for students, researchers, agencies, R&D managers, industry, data providers, and society; (2) create an advanced computing infrastructure for IV/KDV researchers to contribute, run, and compare new and existing algorithms on diverse data sets; and (3) improve IV/KDV teaching, training and learning by means of an online IV/KDV repository, associated learning modules, as well as a textbook.

The envisioned data-code-computing resources environment will provide a one-stop online portal for researchers, educators, and practitioners interested in the study of biomedical, social and behavioral science, physics, and other networks.    The NWB will support network science research across scientific boundaries. Users of the NWB will have online access to major network datasets or can upload their own networks. They will be able to perform network analysis with the most effective algorithms available. In addition, they will be able to generate, run, and validate network models to advance their understanding of the structure and dynamics of particular networks. NWB will provide advanced visualization tools to interactively explore and understand specific networks, as well as their interaction with other types of networks.     A major computer science challenge is the development of an algorithm integration framework that supports the easy integration and dissemination of existing and new algorithms and can deal with the multitude of network data formats in existence today. Another challenge is the design and implementation of an easy to use menu-based, online portal interface for interactive algorithm selection, data manipulation, user and session management. The NWB will be evaluated in diverse research projects and educational settings in biology, social and behavioral science, and physics research. It will be well documented and available as open source for easy duplication and usage at other sites. An annual summer school and a series of workshops and tutorials are planned to introduce the tool to diverse research communities.     The NWB will provide members of the scientific research community at large (biologists, physicists, computer scientists, social and behavioral scientists, engineers, etc.) with the means to carry out network analysis, modeling, and visualization projects in their own fields. This will result in a direct transfer of knowledge and results from the fields of specialist network research to a wider scientific community. Researchers will have access to validated algorithms that in the past have been obtained through time-consuming personal developments of ad hoc computer programs. The NWB is expected to enhance and encourage the empirical analysis and model validation of networks, generating an eventual acceleration in the development of network science research. Online instructional material will support the use of the NWB in educational settings.     The NWB will provide a unique tool for network science researchers in many disciplines. In effect, NWB can deploy the knowledge accumulated in network theory and practice across sciences with just one web click to any interested researcher, practitioner, or student. The NWB shared resources environment will speed up and ease network science applications and education in biology, social and behavioral science, and large infrastructure analysis, thereby accelerating the rate of scientific discovery."

The idea is to utilize advanced data mining and visualization techniques to analyze citation links among papers in the approximately 1300 journals related to chemistry, biochemistry and the life sciences over the past 30 years. Knowledge domain maps will be employed to communicate the growth of both fields of science over time as well as their inter-citations patterns.  The work plan includes data cleaning and parsing, mapping and analyzing the structure of the domains, identification of interdisciplinary information producers and consumers, diffusion of information studies, and validation in cooperation with domain experts in chemistry and the life sciences.    This proof-of-concept project will create baseline visualizations that show the potential of knowledge domain mapping techniques to better inform decisions on programs that require accurate knowledge of the current science and technology infrastructure.  New opportunities in the interdisciplinary areas between chemistry and biology merit study in order for the research community to evaluate the best next steps.  This project will support graduate students in a research university/research lab collaboration.

The Workshop and Conference will bring together leading researchers and practitioners in network science --- analysts, modeling experts, and visualization specialists --- with graduate students from many different research areas for interdisciplinary communication and collaboration.  The Workshop will feature tutorials focusing on a variety of network science research areas.  The Workshop will lead into the Conference, which will feature intellectual discourses and conference presentations from the invited graduate students.    For network research to achieve its potential impact on scientific research, students and faculty need to be broadly trained in this area, learning not only the basic measurement and modeling tools but also their meaning and range of applicability.  The Workshop will provide cross training in the theory and methods of network science, incorporating the perspectives of diverse disciplines such as sociology, organizational science, information science, mathematics, statistics, informatics, biology, and physics.  By bringing together leading researchers and emerging network scholars, the Workshop and the Conference will also promote the development of new mathematical and statistical models with broad application in the social and behavioral sciences.

The Workshop will help acquaint the scientific and engineering community with the potential of social networking tools to enhance the communication and knowledge networks within the communities supported by cyberinfrastructure. Traditionally, social network analysis has focused on small and \"single mode\" or bimodal affiliation networks. The workshop will help the social network analysis community in identifying a research agenda for extending existing theory, methodology, and computational tools to enable large-scale and multidimensional networks. By bringing together leading social network researchers and leading developers of cyberinfrastructure in diverse science and engineering communities, the Workshop will also promote: (i) the specification of new mathematical and statistical models with broad application in the social and behavioral sciences, (ii) the development and extension of scalable algorithms to analyze and visualize the large scale and multidimensional networks that exist within these cybercommunities, and (iii) the development and extension of advanced user-driven software and web services that implement these algorithms to help members of a cybercommunity leverage their communication and knowledge networks.   Broader impacts: The Workshop will offer a unique means for a symbiotic exchange of insights between the social network analysis research community (which cuts across many disciplines, but especially sociology, psychology, communication, organizational science, information science and economic) and the key developers of cyberinfrastructure (which cuts across many disciplines including atmospheric sciences, geo sciences, environmental engineering, ecological research, and public health). The Workshop will help network scholars and students identify the challenges as well as the opportunities of social networking to enable research and education within a cyberinfrastructure. This will result in a direct transfer of knowledge and results from the fields of specialist social network research to wider scientific communities exploring the development of cyberinfrastructure in their fields. The workshop will also assess the viability and contours of developing a Social Network Analysis Cyberinfrastructure for advancing network analysis, modeling, visualization research and education. The broad mix of researchers from these various communities has the potential to unleash a new generation of theory, education, and practice on the role of social networking and 21st century cyberinfrastructure."

At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration system."

They also need a tool that lets them analyze and mine terabytes of relevant data and presents aggregated results in an easy to understand way, enabling them to increase the quality of their decisions. However, more than just a tool is needed. The design of tools that truly support science policy making requires a detailed characterization and prioritization of the information needs of science policy makers, along with a conceptual framework that links the information needs of the policy maker to the available data, analysis and indicator types. Once these are in place, tool development that truly addresses the needs of today's science policy makers given the constraints of existing datasets as well as theoretical and algorithmic approaches can proceed.   This study addresses three challenges.  First, a detailed analysis is conducted of the information needs of a representative set of science policy makers including existing data, approaches and tools.  Second, a theoretic conceptualization is developed of tasks relevant to science policymaking that maps the needs of policy makers to theoretically grounded and practically valuable processing pipelines that transform data into actionable information. This conceptualization is then made available online in a wiki-like format for community review and consensus building.  Third, a prototypical tool--a macroscope--is designed to visualize structure, patterns, trends, and outliers in science and technology data sets that are too large and complex to be comprehensible to the researchers through direct observation--just like microscopes and telescopes make it possible to see things that are too small or too far away. The prototypical macroscope supports a well defined set of information needs, e.g., identification of emerging research frontiers or correlation of funding with publications and patents in an area of research and exploration of results using graphs and geospatial and science maps. Macroscope tool development will benefit from the NSF funded Scholarly Database (SDB)) that provides access to more than 20 million scholarly records, and the Cyberinfrastructure Shell (CIShell), which supports the easy plug and play of datasets and algorithms and the design of stand-alone tools. Usability studies are conducted to evaluate and optimize the macroscope. The macroscope as well as its support of advanced science mapping techniques will be introduced to a broader audience by means of the Places and Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit.  Researchers and science policymakers in Japan will participate in this project, generating a bi-directional flow of best theory and practice.  The scientific study and management of science and technology requires a shared terminology and conceptualization of how science works. It requires shared data repositories that can be used to run benchmarks and comparisons of algorithms, to thoroughly validate the combination of algorithms, indicators, and evaluation procedures. The theoretical component of this study, as well as the extension of the SDB and the prototypical design of a macroscope, will create a basic shared understanding and a freely available cyberinfrastructure and tool for the science of science (policy) community.   The same capabilities that could make the macroscope a tool of choice for science policy makers could also make it attractive to other potential users. For instance, students or members of the public will be able to see the large scale structures of science, and find potential areas of interest for further study; researchers will be able to monitor and access research results, relevant funding opportunities, or find potential collaborators within and without their fields of inquiry. Program managers and reviewers will use it to meet their individual needs."

Many scientific projects and experiments require access not only to results published in papers but also to the raw or processed data used, the services/algorithms/tools applied, the people which performed the work as the paper might not report results in a way that the experiment can be re-run, or new data can be analyzed using the same tools, or all experts familiar with a dataset/algorithm can be retrieved, etc.      The proposed workshop aims to identify the general features of cyber-enabled knowledge management tools in support of discovery. Specifically, the focus is on two major challenges:   * How to better capture and interlink scientific data, algorithms, publications, and expertise?   * How to improve access, navigation, understanding, and discovery by means of visual interfaces to digital resources such as scientific data, algorithms, publications, and expertise?  The two challenges and potential solutions will be discussed in detail using two application domains of major economic and societal importance: science of science studies and biomedical research.     The two-day workshop will bring together about 20 leading US and international experts in databases, digital libraries, cyberinfrastructure/e-Science design, social science of cyberinfrastructure, as well as practitioners in the areas of science of science studies and biology. The goal of the workshop is to identify high impact research directions, technological opportunities, synergistic collaborations across disciplines and application domains towards more effective knowledge management and visualization tools that will support discovery and innovation.

Borner, Indiana University    A new field of Sustainability Science and Engineering is emerging that seeks to understand the fundamental character of interactions between nature and human society and to help steer the impact of humanity's needs on the planet's natural resources towards sustainable trajectories. Sustainability Science and Engineering is unified in clear terms by its ultimate goals but occupies an interdisciplinary position among traditional research fields, spanning both science and engineering and spreading across disciplines as diverse as agriculture, ecology, oceanography, climate studies, economics, a diverse set of social sciences, energy and materials and several additional aspects of engineering, physics, biology, and chemistry. Although Sustainability Science and engineering is by now widely discussed in the scientific and engineering community, and is beginning to be connected to the political agenda for economic and social development, it remains unclear to what extent its many facets are being integrated into a global perspective and whether researchers are utilizing it as a nexus to collaborate across traditional scientific and engineering fields. This project will address such issues by delineating, analyzing, and mapping both basic research on sustainability. Specifically, a comprehensive dataset of scholarly publications, patents, research grants, policy documents and popular science pieces that together define the integrated knowledge of the field will be compiled.     Analysis results will be presented as tables, graphs, and in form of geospatial and science maps. Sustainability experts will be invited to interpret these results. Findings will be presented, discussed, and disseminated via scholarly publications, online, and at a workshop on the topic of sustainability. Encouraging timely scientific and engineering progress across a large set of traditional disciplines requires generating a global perspective (a view 'from above') to determine the most effective actions and incentives to be created by governments, funding agencies, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, and the public at large. This work will map the current state of sustainability science and engineering worldwide and provide actionable insights into its future development. The resulting maps will  be useful for communicating the state of the art as well as to point out challenges and opportunities. They might be extended and adopted as a visual interface into research and practice of Sustainability Science and Engineering. Several graduate students will be involved and trained in this project."
