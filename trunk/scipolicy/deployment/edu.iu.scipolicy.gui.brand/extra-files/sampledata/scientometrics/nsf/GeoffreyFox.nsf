Indiana University - Bloomington  	  RI: A Research Infrastructure for Collaborative, High-Performance Grid Applications    This project, developing an experimental infrastructure for distributed high performance computing, supports ten research projects extending the location-transparency that the Grid provides for computation resources to the full spectrum of activities which end-users require. Services being explored include software development, parallel code middleware, distributed software components for scientific computing, security for parallel remote method invocation,   managing large-scale data streams, and collaboration methodologies. The research builds on and extends the institutions collaborations with several national Grid research teams. In contrast to existing national and university infrastructure available through production machines, this research requires an environment tolerant of experimental network protocols, temporary middleware, and other system-level changes. The infrastructure will contribute to the following research projects:  a. Opie:  basic work on parallel matrix algorithms that achieve high efficiency across many architectural platforms  b. LAM: middleware MPI implementations supporting hierarchical and fault-tolerant parallel computing  c. dQUOB: application of SQL queries to live data streams  d. RMI Security: basic research into security mechanisms for remote method invocation, allowing security to be traded off with efficiency  e. HPJ: High Performance Java creating a language platform for portable high performance coding  f. Grid Broker: reliable, robust publish/subscribe service for introducing fault tolerance into the distributed Grid environment  g. Community Grids Collaboratory: advanced collaboration capabilities with applications to both distance education and distributed communities  h. Xports: design of methodologies for remote instrument access and data management of the resulting extremely large data sets  i. Software Components: distributed software component model designed for applications that use parallel computing \"nodes\" in wide-area Grid environments  j. Science Portals: set of tools that allow programmers to build Grid distributed applications accessed and controlled from desktop environments and web browsers  Major improvements to infrastructure supporting all these projects include a 16-node cycle server and a large-scale file server as well as network upgrades to and within the building."

This approach separates portal control and basic services from content.  A central control server provides basic portal services such as authentication, access control, and user customizability.  Into this framework, portal content and custom services are plugged in using software components called portlets.  The container manages the organization and interaction of the portlets, and the portlets deliver specific web content (either local or remote), including Grid service interfaces.    The portlet-based design concept supports distributed, loosely coupled development and deployment: user interfaces and science interface components can be developed independently, using the standard portlet API, and then reused between portals. Services and interfaces may be installed and added to various portals in a well-defined way.  The portlet model is also an ideal fit to the emerging Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) and its implementation specification, the Open Grid Service Infrastructure (OGSI). Because OGSI is based on the new web-service standards, each Grid service can be directly accessed by a custom portlet.       The impact of making the Grid readily approachable by the international community of researchers is potentially extremely large, as the immense resources that have been collected and organized in recent years by the underlying Grid technologies become visible as usable components of the global research community's desktop.  This project will greatly simplify the use of Grid technologies and allow new services to be made readily available to individual researchers and groups by enabling the proliferation of Grid portal technology through reusability and simplification of installation.  Scientists will be able to easily form flexible groups with collaborators across the world and use the Grid to share data and resources.  This project provides tools for collaboration between established and ad hoc groups of users, enabling those scientists to communicate effectively with each other about the science they are doing, and providing customized views of the Grid that are tailored to meet the needs of collaborating groups."

Much of this data originates from on-line sensors that act as streaming data sources, providing a continuous flow of information. As sensor sources proliferate, the flow of data becomes a deluge, and the extraction and delivery of important features in a timely and comprehensible manner becomes an ever increasingly difficult problem. More specifically, developing data mining and assimilation tools for data deluged applications faces three fundamental challenges. The amount of distributed real time streaming data is so large that even current extreme scale computing cannot effectively process it. Second, today's broadly deployable network protocols and web services do not provide the low latency and high bandwidth required by high volume real time data streams and distributed computing resources connected  over networks with high bandwidth delay products. Finally, the vast majority of today's statistical and data mining algorithms assume that all the data is co-located and at rest in files. Here, the real time data streams are distributed and the applications that consume them must be optimized to process multiple high volume real time streams. The goal is to develop novel algorithms and hardware acceleration schemes to allow real-time statistical modeling and change detection on such large-scale streaming data sets.  By using Service Oriented Architecture principles, a framework for integrating high -performance change detection software services, including accelerations of commonly used kernels in statistical modeling, into a Grid messaging substrate will be developed and tested. Geographical Information System (GIS) services will be supported using  Open Geospatial Consortium standards to enable geo-referencing.     This project has the potential to have near-term and long-term impact in several important areas. In the near-term, the implementation of kernels and modules of statistical modeling and change detection algorithms will allow the end-user applications (e.g., homeland security, defense) to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance for data driven decision support. In the longer term, the availability of toolkits and kernels for the change detection and data mining algorithms will facilitate the development of applications in many areas including defense, security, science and others. Furthermore, this research will bring the use of reconfigurable  architectural acceleration of functions on streaming data including change detection and data mining, thereby opening new avenues of research and enabling newer data-driven applications on complex datasets. Both graduate and undergraduate students (through undergraduate fellowships) are engaged  in the research. In addition, team members actively engage with minority serving institutions using audio/video and distance education tools."

The Minority-serving Institutions Cyberinfrastructure Institute (MSI CI2) initiative will launch the strategic planning process with national CI leaders, host residential and online training employing active learning models, and establish a virtual community of e-Science practice as strategies for building the capacity of MSI faculty to fully exploit CI.     MSI CI2 will build and enhance meaningful collaborations between MSIs and national CI initiatives to engage minority faculty and students in e-science and the international CI community. Initiative goals are to:  (1) Develop the MSI faculty and technical staff CI and e-Science training and support program; (2) Build an MSI e-Science community of practice; and (3) Establish the MSI CI Institute portal. The project will bring together national leaders in CI with leadership of the three MSI communities to develop and provide curricula for a series of \"train-the-trainer\" sessions, a semester long internet course, seminars over the internet and at MSIs, and a summer residential institute. Mentors from the CI community will help guide individual MSI faculty projects.  In addition, the project will include \"Executive Awareness\" activities for MSI presidents and their leadership teams.    Broader Impact: This initiative lays the foundation for a scalable, national effort in which a representative group of stakeholders (in this case, key CI leaders and the broadest coalition of minority serving institutions in American higher education) act as the \"human middleware\" necessary to the development of a universally accessible and comprehensive infrastructure with the capacity to significantly accelerate the discovery and dissemination of scientific knowledge and further the national research agenda.      This initiative will provide a model for the development of the MSI capacity to prepare underrepresented minority students for a future in CI-enabled science, the knowledge-based economy, and the scientific professoriate.  Currently, MSIs are a significant source of science talent producing one-third (33 percent) of the minority baccalaureates in science.  This is critical for the nation's future STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce and the nation's global leadership in science and engineering.  Through the three member organizations that comprise the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education (the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium), at least 335 Minority Serving Institutions could be impacted under full implementation of the Institute."

The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes how quarks are bound together by particles called gluons and suggests that the glouns holding the quarks together manifest themselves in small bundles or tubes between the quarks. Excitations of these \"flux tubes,\" which can be visualized like a jump rope rotating between the quarks, lead to a new family of particles called exotic hybrids that exhibit both the properties of quarks and gluons. The experimental observation and study of these exotic particles is the goal of several current and planned experiments and will ultimately require utilization of computer grids to analyze the petabyte-scale data sets that will be produced by future experiments.    Exotic hybrids have unique sets of so-called quantum numbers that characterize their intrinsic spin, differences in how the matter and antimatter partners behave, and what happens to their properties when one examines them in a mirror. The identification of a particle's quantum numbers is done by using detectors to collect large samples of decays of the particle and then describing the patterns of decays using a procedure called an \"amplitude analysis.\" The observed distributions that characterize decay patterns are then fitted to mathematical functions that depend on the particle's quantum numbers and other theoretical assumptions.  The unambiguous identification of exotic hybrids requires a systematic application of this amplitude analysis and this, in turn, calls for a close collaboration between experimentalists and phenomenologists to understand how experimental and theoretical biases could affect conclusions.    This project will develop a suite of analysis tools built on the backbone of the Open Science Grid, that would allow transparent analysis of current and future experimental data. The open access analysis paradigm being developed in this project will facilitate direct access to data by phenomenologists and their students for testing theoretical models that underpin the amplitude analysis technique. The tools developed will be open-source and will be utilized by future projects or experiments that plan to provide open access to data.      Our analysis framework, coupled with new high quality data, will address problems that hindered earlier analyses that sometimes led to ambiguous or erroneous conclusions."

PolarGrid consist of an intermittently disconnected field and base grids feeding information to \"lower 48\" data and computing resources. True real-time processing at the field camp is backed up with increasing fidelity, but increasing delay at the base and \"lower 48\" systems. The requested system includes an expedition grid consisting of ruggedized laptops in a field grid to a low power multi-core based camp cluster. A prototype and two production grids feed into a Teraflops system at Indiana and Elizabeth City State Universities. PolarGrid will be integrated with TeraGrid for both resource utilization and curricula sharing. Modern open data access standards will be followed so that raw processes, and simulated data can be archived outside PolarGrid by and for the science and engineering community. The innovative architecture of PolarGrid with intermittently disconnected components also has applications to other power- and bandwidth-challenged applications. The instrument responds to the recent polar satellite observations that show disintegration of ice shelves in Antarctica and the speed-up of several glaciers in Greenland.    Broader Impact: The infrastructure addresses an important current problem that touches all beings in one way or another, the key issue of polar ice disintegration. Strong educational activities are involved, mainly through the training of students.

Of the various ways in which a         parallel computer can be implemented with individual computational              processing elements, the hypercube is one.  It is arrived at by taking          the sequence of a point to a line, a line to a square, a square to a            cube and subsequent generalizations to hypercube architectures.  A              processor is located at each vertex.  Such a topology is not as tightly         connected as others but is sufficient to allow significant speed-up in          those calculations involving processors in relatively close                     neighborhoods.                                                                                                                                                  The neural architecture is connected much more densely.  It is also             analog and involves nonlinear summing of signals with subsequent                thresholding (taking a large signal or nothing depending upon whether           the sum is large or small).  It is thus quite different, although it has        parallelism in common.  The hypercube is a good parallel computer on            which to study the behavior of potential neuroengineering systems, for          example an artificial vision system.  Vice versa, the neuroengineering          approaches in development are excellent tools by which to control the           loading of the processors in a parallel machine such as the hypercube           and to control the actual numerical procedure itself.                                                                                                           The fields of endeavor are highly cross-disciplinary.  The benefits to          the engineering profession by support of such a parallel computing              effort will be enormous in terms of speeds of processing and                    calculations which will be attained, as well as large problems which can        ultimately be handled.                                                                                                                                          The orientation of the specific cross-disciplinary team is that of              neuroengineering.  This is an effort which involves vision in particular        and is directed towards its understanding and its operation as an               engineering system.  In addition, effort is being directed towards              understanding of learning and memory processes.  Learning in particular         involves complex processing which for the moment is too complex and too         little understood to be effectively, if at all, integrated into the             hardware of a neuroengineered chip or optical system."

These modules will consist of hypertext documents  combining text, still images, video, and sound using state-of-  the-art technology.  Two prototype units covering topics of a  successful new two-semester course taught at Syracuse  University called Science for the 21st Century have already  been tested in the classroom.  Advanced information-transfer  technologies such as video-on-demand and simulation-on-  demand will be implemented to increase active student  involvement.  New units will be developed to cover other  important science topics, such as evolution and imaging  science phenomena.  The five modules will constitute an  introduction to science for undergraduates who are not science  majors.  Each module will be self-contained and easily  expandable; it will be portable since it will be delivered  through the Internet or in other formats, such as CD-ROM.   There will be three phases of this project:  a) design and  development of modules, b) implementation, testing, and  assessment of modules in our course, and c) dissemination of  products and training of teachers.  Through this pioneering  project, we hope to contribute to the process through which  revolutionary information technology connects with  improvements in our ability to educate our citizenry."

The project combines these ideas to  achieve high performance on parallel machines in a robust fashion over a  range of languages.    Building on earlier research in the Parallel Compiler Runtime Consortium  (PCRC) project, this project will investigate a language model that  combines data-parallel features from High Performance Fortran (HPF) with an  explicitly parallel SPMD programming style.  This \"HPspmd\" model allows  direct calls to many established libraries for parallel programming with  distributed data. By relaxing HPF's single-threaded semantics and having  the programmer explicitly manage non-local references, the task of the  compiler is hugely simplified. However, good library bindings (e.g. class  libraries) supply the required expressiveness for programming.  This  project will develop and optimize a Java version of the language model  (HPJava); design and implement bindings to parallel libraries such as  CHAOS, DAGH, Global Arrays, MPI,and ScaLAPACK; and implement large  applications within the resulting framework.  The implementations are  expected to drive further refinement of the language model, especially in  support of irregular problems."
