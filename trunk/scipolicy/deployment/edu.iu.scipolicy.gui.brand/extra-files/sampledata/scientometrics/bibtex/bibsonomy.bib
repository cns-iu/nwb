	abstract = {This joint LGA and Defra guide is intended to help you  build on your existing work by giving practical ideas and case studies about how each shared priority or outcome can be delivered in a way that helps achieve social, environmental and economic goals together. It is only by taking account of this 'triple-bottom line' in the delivery of local outcomes that we can create genuinely sustainable communities. This means taking account of the overall impact and interactions of delivering each shared priority and ensuring that the efforts on one do not undermine the others.},

	abstract = {Lifetime neighbourhoods are those which offer everyone the best possible chance of health, wellbeing, and social, economic and civic engagement regardless of age. The concept of Lifetime Neighbourhoods is not a new one, but has yet to make a significant impact on planning and neighbourhood design. Most features of lifetime neighbourhoods will benefit all generations. Older people play a major social, economic and civic role alongside other generations. Older people are not just beneficiaries of Lifetime Neighbourhoods, they also have a key role to play in their creation. Sustainable planning of the human environment is interdependent with the development of healthier and wealthier communities. Cross-sectoral engagement in planning is essential for lifetime neighbourhoods. Better representation of the issues of Lifetime Neighbourhoods and an ageing population must be made in local and regional strategies. Planners must be ready to seize strategic opportunities to plan for an ageing population as and when they occur, whether for new communities or existing ones. Intellectual leadership is needed to explore the issue of lifetime neighbourhoods.},

Im Vergleich dazu muss man die empirische Seite der Community-Euphorie als unbefriedigend bezeichnen. Ungeklärt ist nicht nur, ob etwa das angenommene Kreativitäts- und Innovationspotential von Communities praktisch tatsächlich gegeben ist. Offen ist auch die Frage, inwieweit derartige Gemeinschaften auch selbstorganisiert entstehen und existieren können, wie dies das theoretische Community-Konzept fordert. Der Beitrag möchte die Anziehungskraft und Chancen von  Communities näher beleuchten und gleichzeitig auf die kritischen Aspekte aufmerksam machen, die man als Forschungsaufgaben verstehen kann.},

	abstract = {User profiles can be used to identify persons inside a community with similar interests. Folksonomy systems allow users to individually tag the objects of a common set (e.g., web pages). In this paper, we propose to create user profiles from the data available in such folksonomy systems by letting users specify the most relevant objects in the system. Instead of using the objects directly to represent the user profile, we propose to use the tags associated with the specified objects to build the user profile. We have designed a prototype for the research domain to use such tag-based profiles in finding persons with similar interests. The combination of tag-based profiles with standard recommender system technology has resulted in a new kind of recommender system to recommend related publications, keywords, and persons. Especially the latter is useful to find persons to potentially cooperate with and to monitor the community to be able to enhance a user’s current Community of Practice.},
