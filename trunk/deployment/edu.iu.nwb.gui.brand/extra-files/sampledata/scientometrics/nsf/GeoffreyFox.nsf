Understanding the relationship between sea level rise and melting ice sheets is the application domain of this proposal. It is an issue of global importance, especially for the populations living in coastal regions. Scientists are in need of computationally intensive tools and models that will help them measure and predict the response of ice sheets to climate change. The goal for this project is to create a virtual classroom and a TeraGrid gateway for ice-sheet research and education. The major effort will be to utilize the research perfomed by the NSF Science and Technology Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheeets (CReSIS), for educational purposes, through collaborations with the Minority Serving Institutions Cyberinfrastructure Institute (MSI-C(I)2), and the Association of Computer and Information Science/Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI). The vision is to prepare the current and next generation of traditionally, underrepresented, minority scientists, engineers and educators with the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct interdisciplinary research in areas of cyberinfrastructure, remote sensing, engineering and modeling related to glaciers and ice sheets. Broader Impacts: This project brings together effective partners to incorporate both academic year research and summer outreach in conjunction with minority serving institutions to reach a diverse student population."

These include topics ranging from authentication, authorization, scheduling, virtualization, middleware design, interface design and cybersecurity, to the optimization of grid-enabled and cloud-enabled computational schemes for researchers in astronomy, chemistry, biology, engineering, atmospheric science and epidemiology. The project team will provide a significant new experimental computing grid and cloud test-bed, named FutureGrid, to the research community, together with user support for third-party researchers conducting experiments on FutureGrid.<br/><br/>The test-bed will make it possible for researchers to conduct experiments by submitting an experiment ?plan? that is then executed via a sophisticated workflow engine, preserving the provenance and state information necessary to allow reproducibility. <br/><br/>The test-bed includes a geographically distributed set of heterogeneous computing systems, a data management system that will hold both metadata and a growing library of software images, and a dedicated network allowing isolatable, secure experiments. The test-bed will support virtual machine-based environments, as well as native operating systems for experiments aimed at minimizing overhead and maximizing performance. The project partners will integrate existing open-source software packages to create an easy-to-use software environment that supports the instantiation, execution and recording of grid and cloud computing experiments. <br/><br/>One of the goals of the project is to understand the behavior and utility of cloud computing approaches. Researchers will be able to measure the overhead of cloud technology by requesting linked experiments on both virtual and bare-metal systems. FutureGrid will enable US scientists to develop and test new approaches to parallel, grid and cloud computing, and compare and collaborate with international efforts in this area. The FutureGrid project will provide an experimental platform that accommodates batch, grid and cloud computing, allowing researchers to attack a range of research questions associated with optimizing, integrating and scheduling the different service models. The FutureGrid also provides a test-bed for middleware development and, because of its private network, allows middleware researchers to do controlled experiments under different network conditions and to test approaches to middleware that include direct interaction with the network control layer. Another component of the project is the development of benchmarks appropriate for grid computing, including workflow-based benchmarks derived from applications in astronomy, bioinformatics, seismology and physics.<br/><br/>The FutureGrid will form part of NSF's TeraGrid high-performance cyberinfrastructure. It will increase the capability of the TeraGrid to support innovative computer science research requiring access to lower levels of the grid software stack, the networking software stack, and to virtualization and workflow orchestration tools. Full integration into the TeraGrid is anticipated by 1st October 2011. <br/><br/>Education and broader outreach activities include the dissemination of curricular materials on the use of FutureGrid, pre-packaged FutureGrid virtual machines configured for particular course modules, and educational modules based on virtual appliance networks and social networking technologies that will focus on education in networking, parallel computing, virtualization and distributed computing. The project will advance education and training in distributed computing at academic institutions with less diverse computational resources. It will do this through the development of instructional resources that include preconfigured environments that provide students with sandboxed virtual clusters. These can be used for teaching courses in parallel, cloud, and grid computing. Such resources will also provide academic institutions with a simple opportunity to experiment with cloud technology to see if such technology can enhance their campus resources. The FutureGrid project leverages the fruits of several software development projects funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy."

This problem cannot be addressed by existing cryptographic techniques alone, which are often too heavyweight to manage the computation involving a large amount of data. As a result, many computing tasks have to be run on individual organizations? internal systems whenever they touch even a very small amount of sensitive information.<br/><br/>The research in this project seeks practical solutions to this critical security challenge. The PIs are working on an approach to split a computing job over a hybrid-cloud platform, delegating to a public cloud the computation over public data, while keeping the computation on sensitive data within a private cloud. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs are developing a privacy-aware MapReduce system, which transparently partitions a computing job and schedules its components across the public/private clouds according to the security levels of the data involved. The system is designed to achieve high security assurance and outsource most of its workload when possible, at small computational and communication overheads. It includes support for analyzing and transforming the code for legacy jobs as well as developing new jobs. We are also working to extend these techniques to facilitate other secure work-flow processing over hybrid clouds.

PolarGrid will be integrated with TeraGrid for both resource utilization and curricula sharing. Modern open data access standards will be followed so that raw processes, and simulated data can be archived outside PolarGrid by and for the science and engineering community. The innovative architecture of PolarGrid with intermittently disconnected components also has applications to other power- and bandwidth-challenged applications. The instrument responds to the recent polar satellite observations that show disintegration of ice shelves in Antarctica and the speed-up of several glaciers in Greenland.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The infrastructure addresses an important current problem that touches all beings in one way or another, the key issue of polar ice disintegration.

The Center?s vision is to understand and predict the role of polar ice sheets in sea level change. In particular, the Center?s mission is to develop technologies, to conduct field investigations, to compile data to understand why many outlet glaciers and ice streams are changing rapidly, and to develop models that explain and predict ice sheet response to climate change. The Center?s mission is also to educate and train a diverse population of graduate and undergraduate students in Center-related disciplines and to encourage K-12 students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM-fields). The long-term goals are to perform a four-dimensional characterization (space and time) of rapidly changing ice-sheet regions, develop diagnostic and predictive ice-sheet models, and contribute to future assessments of sea level change in a warming climate. In the first five years, significant progress was made in developing, testing and optimizing innovative sensors and platforms and completing a major aircraft campaign, which included sounding the channel under Jakobshavn Isbræ. In the second five years, research will focus on the interpretation of integrated data from a suite of sensors to understand the physical processes causing changes and the subsequent development and validation of models. Information about CReSIS can be found at http://www.cresis.ku.edu.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the STC are the multidisciplinary research it enables its faculty, staff and students to pursue, as well as the broad education and training opportunities it provides to students at all levels. During the first phase, the Center provided scientists and engineers with a collaborative research environment and the opportunity to interact, enabling the development of high-sensitivity radars integrated with several airborne platforms and innovative seismic instruments. Also, the Center successfully collected data on ice thickness and bed conditions, key variables in the study of ice dynamics and the development of models, for three major fast-flowing glaciers in Greenland. During the second phase, the Center will collect additional data over targeted sites in areas undergoing rapid changes; process, analyze and interpret collected data; and develop advanced process-oriented and ice sheet models to predict future behavior. The Center will continue to provide a rich environment for multidisciplinary education and mentoring for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, as well as for conducting K-12 education and public outreach. The broader impacts of the Center stem from addressing a global environmental problem with critical societal implications, providing a forum for citizens and policymakers to become informed about climate change issues, training the next generation of scientists and engineers to serve the nation, encouraging underrepresented students to pursue careers in STEM-related fields, and transferring new technologies to industry. Students involved in the Center find an intellectually stimulating atmosphere where collaboration between disciplines is the norm and exposure to a wide variety of methodologies and scientific issues enriches their educational experience. The next generation of researchers should reflect the diversity of our society; the Center will therefore continue its work with ECSU to conduct outreach and educational programs that attract minority students to careers in science and technology. The Center has also established a new partnership with ADMI that supports faculty and student exchanges at the national level and provides expanded opportunities for students and faculty to be involved in Center-related research and education activities. These, and other collaborations, will provide broader opportunities to encourage underrepresented students to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>As lead institution, The University of Kansas (KU) provides overall direction and management, as well as expertise in radar and remote sensing, Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and modeling and interpretation of data. Five partner institutions and a DOE laboratory play critical roles in the STC. The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) continues to participate in technology development for seismic measurements, field activities, and modeling. The Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing, Education and Research (CERSER) at Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) contributes its expertise to analyzing satellite data and generating high-level data products.

Of the various ways in which a parallel computer can be implemented with individual computational processing elements, the hypercube is one. It is arrived at by taking the sequence of a point to a line, a line to a square, a square to a cube and subsequent generalizations to hypercube architectures. A processor is located at each vertex. Such a topology is not as tightly connected as others but is sufficient to allow significant speed-up in those calculations involving processors in relatively close neighborhoods. The neural architecture is connected much more densely. It is also analog and involves nonlinear summing of signals with subsequent thresholding (taking a large signal or nothing depending upon whether the sum is large or small). It is thus quite different, although it has parallelism in common. The hypercube is a good parallel computer on which to study the behavior of potential neuroengineering systems, for example an artificial vision system. Vice versa, the neuroengineering approaches in development are excellent tools by which to control the loading of the processors in a parallel machine such as the hypercube and to control the actual numerical procedure itself. The fields of endeavor are highly cross-disciplinary. The benefits to the engineering profession by support of such a parallel computing effort will be enormous in terms of speeds of processing and calculations which will be attained, as well as large problems which can ultimately be handled. The orientation of the specific cross-disciplinary team is that of neuroengineering. This is an effort which involves vision in particular and is directed towards its understanding and its operation as an engineering system. In addition, effort is being directed towards understanding of learning and memory processes. Learning in particular involves complex processing which for the moment is too complex and too little understood to be effectively, if at all, integrated into the hardware of a neuroengineered chip or optical system."

The Minority-serving Institutions Cyberinfrastructure Institute (MSI CI2) initiative will launch the strategic planning process with national CI leaders, host residential and online training employing active learning models, and establish a virtual community of e-Science practice as strategies for building the capacity of MSI faculty to fully exploit CI. <br/><br/>MSI CI2 will build and enhance meaningful collaborations between MSIs and national CI initiatives to engage minority faculty and students in e-science and the international CI community. Initiative goals are to: (1) Develop the MSI faculty and technical staff CI and e-Science training and support program; (2) Build an MSI e-Science community of practice; and (3) Establish the MSI CI Institute portal. The project will bring together national leaders in CI with leadership of the three MSI communities to develop and provide curricula for a series of ""train-the-trainer"" sessions, a semester long internet course, seminars over the internet and at MSIs, and a summer residential institute. Mentors from the CI community will help guide individual MSI faculty projects. In addition, the project will include ""Executive Awareness"" activities for MSI presidents and their leadership teams.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This initiative lays the foundation for a scalable, national effort in which a representative group of stakeholders (in this case, key CI leaders and the broadest coalition of minority serving institutions in American higher education) act as the ""human middleware"" necessary to the development of a universally accessible and comprehensive infrastructure with the capacity to significantly accelerate the discovery and dissemination of scientific knowledge and further the national research agenda. <br/><br/>This initiative will provide a model for the development of the MSI capacity to prepare underrepresented minority students for a future in CI-enabled science, the knowledge-based economy, and the scientific professoriate. Currently, MSIs are a significant source of science talent producing one-third (33 percent) of the minority baccalaureates in science. This is critical for the nation's future STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce and the nation's global leadership in science and engineering. Through the three member organizations that comprise the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education (the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium), at least 335 Minority Serving Institutions could be impacted under full implementation of the Institute."

The primary goal of the next phase of the TeraGrid, XD, is to enable major advances in science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engineering by under-represented groups, by providing researchers and educators with usable access to extreme-scale digital resources, beyond those typically available on a typical campus, together with the interfaces, consulting support and training necessary to facilitate their use. The target for XD is innovation in the design and implementation of an effective, efficient, increasingly virtualized approach to the provision of high-end digital services ? extreme digital services - for researchers and educators. The XD infrastructure is intended to integrate extreme-scale digital resources and services into a common framework that makes it easy for researchers to take advantage of multiple resources and services, including the ability to move between using local resources and national resources within a single, well integrated environment. <br/><br/>The proposed activity is a planning activity for a project that, if successful, will provide infrastructure for research and education across a broad range of areas in science and engineering. In addition to users who are career researchers, it can reasonably be expected that this infrastructure will be used by several hundred graduate students and post-doctoral researchers each year as part of their research. The planning activity includes outreach to scientists and engineers from many fields."

This approach separates portal control and basic services from content. A central control server provides basic portal services such as authentication, access control, and user customizability. Into this framework, portal content and custom services are plugged in using software components called portlets. The container manages the organization and interaction of the portlets, and the portlets deliver specific web content (either local or remote), including Grid service interfaces.<br/><br/>The portlet-based design concept supports distributed, loosely coupled development and deployment: user interfaces and science interface components can be developed independently, using the standard portlet API, and then reused between portals. Services and interfaces may be installed and added to various portals in a well-defined way. The portlet model is also an ideal fit to the emerging Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) and its implementation specification, the Open Grid Service Infrastructure (OGSI). Because OGSI is based on the new web-service standards, each Grid service can be directly accessed by a custom portlet. <br/><br/>The impact of making the Grid readily approachable by the international community of researchers is potentially extremely large, as the immense resources that have been collected and organized in recent years by the underlying Grid technologies become visible as usable components of the global research community's desktop. This project will greatly simplify the use of Grid technologies and allow new services to be made readily available to individual researchers and groups by enabling the proliferation of Grid portal technology through reusability and simplification of installation. Scientists will be able to easily form flexible groups with collaborators across the world and use the Grid to share data and resources. This project provides tools for collaboration between established and ad hoc groups of users, enabling those scientists to communicate effectively with each other about the science they are doing, and providing customized views of the Grid that are tailored to meet the needs of collaborating groups."

The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes how quarks are bound together by particles called gluons and suggests that the glouns holding the quarks together manifest themselves in small bundles or tubes between the quarks. Excitations of these ""flux tubes,"" which can be visualized like a jump rope rotating between the quarks, lead to a new family of particles called exotic hybrids that exhibit both the properties of quarks and gluons. The experimental observation and study of these exotic particles is the goal of several current and planned experiments and will ultimately require utilization of computer grids to analyze the petabyte-scale data sets that will be produced by future experiments.<br/><br/>Exotic hybrids have unique sets of so-called quantum numbers that characterize their intrinsic spin, differences in how the matter and antimatter partners behave, and what happens to their properties when one examines them in a mirror. The identification of a particle's quantum numbers is done by using detectors to collect large samples of decays of the particle and then describing the patterns of decays using a procedure called an ""amplitude analysis."" The observed distributions that characterize decay patterns are then fitted to mathematical functions that depend on the particle's quantum numbers and other theoretical assumptions. The unambiguous identification of exotic hybrids requires a systematic application of this amplitude analysis and this, in turn, calls for a close collaboration between experimentalists and phenomenologists to understand how experimental and theoretical biases could affect conclusions.<br/><br/>This project will develop a suite of analysis tools built on the backbone of the Open Science Grid, that would allow transparent analysis of current and future experimental data. The open access analysis paradigm being developed in this project will facilitate direct access to data by phenomenologists and their students for testing theoretical models that underpin the amplitude analysis technique. The tools developed will be open-source and will be utilized by future projects or experiments that plan to provide open access to data. <br/><br/>Our analysis framework, coupled with new high quality data, will address problems that hindered earlier analyses that sometimes led to ambiguous or erroneous conclusions."

The amount of distributed real time streaming data is so large that even current extreme scale computing cannot effectively process it. Second, today's broadly deployable network protocols and web services do not provide the low latency and high bandwidth required by high volume real time data streams and distributed computing resources connected<br/>over networks with high bandwidth delay products. Finally, the vast majority of today's statistical and data mining algorithms assume that all the data is co-located and at rest in files. Here, the real time data streams are distributed and the applications that consume them must be optimized to process multiple high volume real time streams. The goal is to develop novel algorithms and hardware acceleration schemes to allow real-time statistical modeling and change detection on such large-scale streaming data sets. By using Service Oriented Architecture principles, a framework for integrating high -performance change detection software services, including accelerations of commonly used kernels in statistical modeling, into a Grid messaging substrate will be developed and tested. Geographical Information System (GIS) services will be supported using<br/>Open Geospatial Consortium standards to enable geo-referencing. <br/><br/>This project has the potential to have near-term and long-term impact in several important areas. In the near-term, the implementation of kernels and modules of statistical modeling and change detection algorithms will allow the end-user applications (e.g., homeland security, defense) to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance for data driven decision support. In the longer term, the availability of toolkits and kernels for the change detection and data mining algorithms will facilitate the development of applications in many areas including defense, security, science and others. Furthermore, this research will bring the use of reconfigurable<br/>architectural acceleration of functions on streaming data including change detection and data mining, thereby opening new avenues of research and enabling newer data-driven applications on complex datasets. Both graduate and undergraduate students (through undergraduate fellowships) are engaged in the research. In addition, team members actively engage with minority serving institutions using audio/video and distance education tools."

The assessment task will be conducted from the perspective of the global scale program towards educational VR. The planning task will identify a set of pilot modules to be developed at NPAC, tested in local schools, and included into the global infrastructure developed by several sites. Within the assessment task, we expect to interact within the NSF guided electronic forum with other sites developing components of information infrastructure. This will allow to both establish unified global strategy and to identify the most appropriate focused modules to be prototyped at NPAC. ***"
