The biggest limitation for currently commercialized low temperature fuel cells is the high cost and degradation of membranes and platinum-based electrocatalysts. AEM-DEFCs have several key advantages over these fuel cells: (1) faster, more efficient oxygen and ethanol reactions to produce more energy with less raw material; (2) wider choices of cheaper, non-platinum electrodes; (3) greater stability of fuel cell components; and (4) increased fuel safety and portability by using bio-ethanol. Since 2008, the PI's team has innovated and patented the technology for affordable, highly efficient polymeric electrolyte membranes and catalysts in anion-exchange-membrane fuel cells. The remaining challenge for advancing this early-stage technology to the marketplace is demonstrating its stability and efficiency in a wide range of applications and fuel types.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are to create technology alliances among partners that build innovation capacity from the unique multidisciplinary interaction of experts in fuel cell technology and adjacent fields. The innovation capacity of IUPUI will be increased through the establishment of integral partnerships to obtain AEM-DEFC component materials, fuel sources, marketing strategies, and fuels optimization research expertise. The innovation capacity of the small business partners will be reinforced through applications for their existing intellectual property by: 1) providing a new market for bio-ethanol fuel production (Xylogenics, Inc.); 2) expanding existing market strategies and prototyping and validation processes into fuel cell technologies (Faraday Technology, Inc.); and 3) refining AEMFC technologies by addressing the catalyst challenges in addition to membrane development (Tremont Technology LLC). More broadly, AEM-DEFCs have great potential to replace combustion-powered generators and rechargeable batteries for remote military operations and portable electronic applications, respectively, because of their high efficiency, portability, low-detection (lower heat signature), no battery recharge, and low cost. The timely development of efficient, durable, and cost-effective AEM-DEFCs and corresponding bio-ethanol fuels is imperative to meeting current and future energy demands while reducing operating costs and military vulnerability through locally-source bio-fuels. Commercialized AEM-DEFCs will have local impact by revitalizing industrial and rural economies and global impact by alleviating pressure on non-renewable resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution: Indiana University/Purdue University Indianapolis, including the Department of Engineering and Technology, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and the Richard G. Lugar Center for Renewable Energy; small technology-based business partners: Faraday Technology Inc. (Clayton, Ohio), Tremont Technology LLC (Fishers, Indiana), and Xylogenics Inc. (Indianapolis, Indiana); and other partners in the following sectors: non-profit--Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation (Indianapolis, Indiana); government--Indiana Department of Corrections (Indianapolis, Indiana); and small business--Melon Acres, Inc.(Oaktown, Indiana)."

The project provides for two pathways to produce the STEM teachers: 1) a discipline-specific B.S./M.S. program in biology, chemistry, physics, and geology, in which qualified science majors earn both a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline and a master's degree in education, as well as science teacher licensure and 2) the Transition to Teaching (T2T) program, which is a vehicle for graduate science majors and career changes who hold degrees in science and engineering fields to meet the requirements for science teacher licensure in Indiana.<br/><br/>The conceptual framework for this Teachers for a New Decade project is summarized by ""Six Principles for Teacher Education,"" which have been developed over multiple years by IUB faculty and speak to Knowledge, Meaningful Experience, Personalized Learning, Community, Critical Reflection, and Growth. This program is NCATE approved. The project includes a Noyce Mentor Coordinator who serves as a resource to Noyce Scholar-Teachers during their first year. This individual complements the teacher mentors in the schools by connecting them with relevant IUB faculty, thus ensuring responsiveness to content-driven needs of the fledgling Noyce Teachers. In addition to face-to-face mentoring, the project will utilize the ""PBS TeacherLine Peer Connection"" online induction delivery platform, which embeds research briefs along with short video podcasts modeling research-based best practice instructional strategies, along with Twitter or other real-time social media applications that are adaptable to coaching. <br/><br/>The formative aspect of the evaluation will examine: the extent to which faculty and administrators make use of results and materials from prior NSF projects and the research literature on minority recruitment and supports; the effectiveness of ""cohort"" and mentoring in scholar/teachers' retention and completion; and institutional capacity building and changes needed to recruit and support cross-disciplinary students entering STEM education. The summative evaluation will focus on: how the scholar/teachers' content knowledge and prior experiences influence their instructional decision-making; which components of the preparation program have the greatest impact on induction experiences; how the supervision and mentoring components facilitated the transition from pre-service into teaching; and how these aspects of the project influenced teacher retention of the scholar/teachers."

Continued investigation of natural products is essential for the discovery of small molecules to probe biological processes, as therapeutic leads, and to identify new molecular architectures for synthetic and biosynthetic studies. Current isolation strategies facilitate enrichment based on a restricted set of mechanisms that are dependent upon physical properties such as solubility or size. Generation of a method that separates compounds by a unique and complementary mechanism, such as functional group composition, would represent a major advance in the field and is a major goal of the proposed research. Preliminary work in Professor Carlson's lab has resulted in the generation of a tagging strategy for the enrichment of alcohol-containing natural products and confirmed the ability of this method to facilitate detection of low abundance species. This award will enable pursuit of tagging strategies for additional functional group classes and application of these tools to the exploration of myriad natural products sources resulting in the discovery of new natural products and novel chemical scaffolds.<br/><br/>This CAREER award to Professor Carlson of Indiana University will result in a number of broader impacts. Of particular emphasis will be the utilization of natural products as a platform to ignite an interest in and appreciation for chemistry, especially in girls and young women. Girls often do not feel a connection with science - they lack an understanding of how it is useful or relevant to their lives and cannot relate to the people they perceive as being scientists. Interest in science needs to be generated and nurtured to encourage girls to continue with science education. The PI will develop an outreach program called Natural Products and Lighting the Fire of Curiosity to ignite an interest in science in local elementary and middle school aged girls. This program will introduce students to natural products, focusing on compounds produced by plants. The outreach materials generated will be broadly disseminated via the internet to enable teachers worldwide to utilize these resources. To date, this program has been shared with over 125 students and is now published as an official activity available to Girl Scout troops throughout southern Indiana. Natural products will also be used as inspiration for the development of laboratory curriculum at Indiana University that more closely resemble genuine research experiences. Inquiry-based modules will be devised and included in both introductory and advanced organic laboratories."

Particles emitted when high-energy beams of spin-aligned protons collide in the STAR detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider can reveal how much of the proton's spin is carried by its gluons or by different types of quarks and anti-quarks. The group will search for the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton and explore spin differences among antiquarks. They will also measure how polarized quarks turn into mesons and baryons and search for indications that strongly interacting matter breaks mirror symmetry;(2) The properties and interactions of neutrinos. Neutrinos can change from one form to another, but all the evidence doesn't quite fit at low energies. They will study the reasons for the larger-than-expected neutrino interactions they have measured; (3) How strong the weak force really is. They will gain new insights by observing the angular distribution of the particles created when a neutron decays, and by testing whether nature respects mirror symmetry as neutrons get captured in hydrogen; and (4) What are the properties of the early universe. They will sharpen theoretical predictions of the amount of helium left over in the Big Bang by measuring the decay rate of the neutron.<br/><br/>Their research activities educate the next generation of skilled PhD scientists for jobs in research and teaching universities, industry and national labs, and medical and computer technology. They redirected their cyclotrons to form the Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute, which has treated more than 1000 cancer patients. They co-organize and lecture at summer schools. They participate in the NSF REU program. They mentor their postdocs to facilitate their future entry into teaching and research institutions and the scientific community. They develop undergraduate laboratories emphasizing nuclear technology, bring undergraduates on field trips and assist with programs that encourage pre-college participation in the Indiana University science curriculum. They engage bright young undergraduates in science through jobs or projects which develop the research skills they will need for success in graduate school. They reach out to the local community through a variety of activities to awaken the interest of students in our local public school system by visiting local high school science classes, acting as judges in local science fairs and for the State Science Olympiad, and presenting physics demonstrations at the Indiana State Fair. They actively recruit female and minority applicants for positions at all levels within the group and the physics department by serving on selection committees for faculty searches and research fellowships for women.

This understanding will in turn enable application of metal isotope geochemistry to a wide range of important questions, including those related to contaminant metal fate and transport, availability of bioessential metals in natural waters and sediments, origin of ore deposits, and records of early life on Earth and other planets. The MC-ICP-MS will be located in the recently completed Multidisciplinary Science Building II, which also contains a newly constructed, dedicated clean room for experimentation and sample preparation. The instrument shares space with a well-established and internationally recognized gas-source mass spectrometry facility and thus extends the analytical capabilities of that laboratory across the entire periodic table.

This work is organized around the following four questions:<br/><br/>What is the origin of the spin of the proton? Experiments show that, contrary to expectation, the quark spins carry a small fraction of the total. Gluons, the carriers of the strong force, and the orbital motion of quarks inside the proton are the only other possibilities. We use high-energy polarized proton-proton collisions at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to measure the gluon contribution to the proton spin and also search for information on the quark's orbital motion.<br/><br/>Why is more matter than antimatter left over after the end of the Big Bang? Matter and antimatter in the expansion of the universe are created and annihilated in equal amounts unless processes exist which depend on the direction of time. Time reversal violation also gives rise to the spontaneous separation of positive and negative electric charge along the spin axis of fundamental particles. Searches for such a separation are underway using an electric field to induce a bulk matter magnetization in a garnet crystal and to precess the spin axis of neutrons captured in a liquid helium bath.<br/><br/>What are the properties and interactions of neutrinos? These elusive particles formed during nuclear and particle decay can change in flight from one type to another. New data at low energies from the MiniBooNE detector at Fermilab seem to indicate that such changes do not fit into the standard pattern established by the number of known quarks and leptons. Work to compare neutrino and anti-neutrino effects and measure neutrino-induced reactions is underway. We will also check to see if neutrinos are their own anti-particles.<br/><br/>How strong are the parts of the weak force? This force causes nuclear beta decay and other nuclear reactions that violate mirror symmetry. Experiments are in preparation to search for mirror-asymmetry in the photons from neutron-proton capture and for a corkscrew motion of neutron spins as they travel through liquid helium. We also propose to measure the lifetime and decay properties of the neutron itself.<br/><br/>We share the knowledge gained by this work and our experiences in scientific research through Open Houses, laboratory tours, science café discussions, and news items in the local public media. We strive to awaken the interest of students in the local school system in science by visiting science classes, conducting career presentations, judging science fair projects, participating in events at the Science Olympiad, and performing physics demonstrations at the Indiana State Fair. We prepare the next generation of scientists, educators, and technically-trained people for industry by educating post-doctoral research assistants, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. We organize summer schools for nuclear physics and its various specialties. With the resources available at a laboratory with its own suite of accelerators, we also provide new detectors and experimental technologies that expand the research possibilities across the nation in ways that are beyond the reach of many university departments. We share this technology base with a proton beam cancer treatment facility at the IU Health Proton Therapy Center, which has treated more than 1000 patients with a staff composed in part of our former students and postdocs."

Through the NSF MRI award, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) acquired the iMIC Andromeda to develop a state-of-the art microscope facility benefiting the research and research training of several departments within IUP?s College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (CNSM). More specifically, the acquisition of the iMIC strengthens a current research emphasis on plasticity and cell-signaling. Researchers can address basic biological and biochemical questions about the structural and functional remodeling that occurs in several physiological events, including normal development pathways, metabolic processes, the generation of biological rhythms and vacuole formation in yeast. Additionally, IUP researchers are using the iMIC in an innovative way to measure fluorescence and the absorptive spectra of novel optical materials to further the goal of enhancing telecommunications and sensor applications. Overall, the augmented imaging capabilities of this facility allow for in-depth analyses of several biological, biochemical and physics projects, as well as the initiation of additional research projects for which highly developed fluorescent microscopy is required.<br/><br/>The iMIC expands CNSM research capabilities and has the inimitable advantage of being used by a significant number of students and university professors in a variety of scientific disciplines. In addition to providing faculty members with opportunities to broaden their research repertoire, the iMIC enhances intra- and interuniversity collaborative research efforts between faculty and students. The iMIC also impacts the advancement of science education at IUP, including undergraduate and graduate CNSM students. Regional high school students interact with the iMIC through workshops and outreach programs designed to enhance STEM training. This promises to be a significant recruiting tool as approximately 75% of IUP students are from rural Pennsylvania and have not been exposed to state-of-the-art microscopes like the iMIC Andromeda. Importantly, graduate, undergraduate and secondary students are able to design research projects involving advanced microscopy techniques under the careful mentorship of IUP faculty?experiences that will better prepare them for careers in biology. Thus, the iMIC is expanding the range of techniques that can be offered to introduce CNSM students to the rapidly advancing field of microscopic imaging that has changed the paradigm for basic and applied sciences."

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a fundamental analytical technique for surface and materials-based research. It is the equivalent of nuclear magnetic resonance to organic chemists, providing those studying solids with elemental composition and chemical/electronic state information of surfaces. This dual-use instrument will have immediate impact on research ranging from the development of organic or inorganic materials for solar energy, chemical sensing, and catalytic applications to fundamental studies involving structure determination of new materials and the interactions of water or organic molecules with surfaces. Critical to these projects is chemical and electronic state information for prepared materials, of which XPS and UPS are the state-of-the-art methods used to obtain such information. This instrumentation will allow us to elucidate the complex structure-function relationships of the nanomaterials we are studying, addressing fundamental questions while also propelling our projects forward towards more functional materials that address societal needs. The information garnered from these projects will have broad impacts, forging links between scientific disciplines that include organic/inorganic/solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics, surface science, material science, and the geological sciences.<br/><br/>General Abstract<br/><br/>Nanoscience is concerned with the unique properties of materials with sizes less than about a millionth of a meter. The ability to measure and understand the fundamental phenomena associated with such materials is essential to advancing many areas of modern science, including energy production, environmental remediation, and biomedical and information technology. Research in these fields is highly interdisciplinary and requires access to shared instrumentation for creating and characterizing nanoscale materials. Thus, Indiana University - Bloomington has established a shared facility, the Nanoscale Characterization Facility, and is requesting support for the acquisition of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer for research and education. This instrument also will be equipped with Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy. On-site X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy will allow researchers and students affiliated with Indiana University to better understand how the structure and composition of a given material give rise to its unique properties. This information will allow for the better design of nanoscale materials used in a range of applications. The acquisition of this instrument will also have broad impacts, forging links between scientific disciplines, helping to elevate the NCF to a world-class research facility, enhancing undergraduate and graduate training in interdisciplinary science, and contributing to broad outreach activities in which the IU's Nanoscience Center partners with regional academic and research institutions (including HBCUs), industrial groups, K-12 educators, and campus organizations."

Given the current state of the system, can one predict the future state? How does this evolution of the state of the system depend on the parameters of the system? Many such dynamical systems are far too complicated for a rigorous study, so one resorts to simpler models, which are hoped to indicate the types of behavior that one should expect experimentally. One venue for such simpler models is the iteration of holomorphic maps, the topic of this project. Completing these projects will provide a deeper understanding of fundamental properties of dynamical systems in several complex variables and it will build connections with other areas of mathematics. The broader impacts of this project are largely educational, focusing on both high school students and Ph.D. students. Funding for this project will help to develop an interest and talent in mathematics among high school students, both local and throughout Indiana. It will help to train at least one supported Ph.D. student at Indiana University-Purdue University and also to train Ph.D. students from all over the United States by means of two workshops on holomorphic dynamics in several variables.<br/><br/>The main research goal of this project is to explore several examples where the iteration of a holomorphic self-map of a complex manifold has a connection with another area of mathematics or mathematical physics. Not only does the connection allow for applications in the other area, but the context coming from that area usually gives the mapping extra structure, allowing for a significantly deeper study. Four projects are proposed relating dynamics in several complex variables to Thurston theory, the Ising model from statistical physics, the spectra of certain operators arising from self-similar group actions, and complex time ordinary differential equations (the Painleve equations). The proposed research projects are designed around three principles: (1) exploring connections between two or more different areas of mathematics can lead to surprising new results, (2) dynamical systems having an additional context from another field can be studied significantly more deeply, and (3) a study of concrete examples often leads to statements and proofs of more general theorems. Partnered with the main research goals are several educational goals: (1) leading local high school students on specially tailored research projects, (2) helping to run and improve the Indiana University-Purdue University High School Math Contest, (3) leading Ph.D. students on the main research projects mentioned above, and (4) organizing two workshops on dynamics in several complex variables which have a training component for Ph.D. students."

Professor Cook's laboratory works to design reaction manifolds that may lead to new approaches in carbon-carbon bond formation. By utilizing Csp3-carbopalladium intermediates generated from alkyl electrophiles in migratory insertion pathways, the general problem of beta-hydride elimination can be avoided. Once beta-hydride elimination is avoided, complexity building cascade reactions will be developed, which would streamline the synthesis of complex molecular architectures.

The successful development of this research program is expected to have positive impact on a wide range of endeavors requiring the preparation of synthetic organic compounds, including pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials industries, as well as biological and chemical research. The CAREER Award will also provide support for two education programs. The first program allows Indiana University undergraduate students to take their research experience back to their hometowns in rural Indiana to team-teach classes on catalysis with their former high school teachers. These undergraduate Ambassadors of Catalysis will use a hands-on demonstrations and discuss their ongoing research to recruit the next generation of scientists.

While lettuce, sunflower, and safflower are the three most valuable members of this family, over 40 species have been domesticated for a wide variety of uses. The Compositae also contains some of the world's most noxious weeds, which cost the United States an estimated $35 billion annually. The primary goal of this project is to develop genomic resources for the continued study of this important plant family. This work will include: (i) sequencing the gene-rich regions of the lettuce, sunflower, and safflower genomes; (ii) generation of ""gene catalogs"" for 25 additional taxa, including six crops, three weeds, the wild progenitors of ten crops and weeds, representatives of five taxonomically important subfamilies within the family, and an outgroup (i.e., a close relative of the family); (iii) analyses of the prevalence of variation in gene copy number versus nucleotide variation; (iv) analyses of the effects of whole genome duplications on diversification rates within the family; (v) identification of parallel genetic changes across crop/weed lineages; (vi) construction of ultra-high density genetic maps of lettuce, sunflower, and chicory; (vii) development of permanent populations for genetic mapping in key Compositae species; and (viii) the identification and validation of candidates for genes underlying important crop- and weed-related traits. This research will result in the generation of permanent resources for the Compositae research community and will have a significant economic impact through its contributions to both crop and weed science. This project will also result in the training of students at all levels in genetics, biochemistry, physiology, comparative genomics, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project will have a major, lasting impact on both crop and weed science through the production of permanent, publicly available genomics resources. All results will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at national and international meetings, and the resulting data will be made publicly available through the project website (http://compgenomics.ucdavis.edu) and via deposition in GenBank and other freely-accessible, online databases. In addition, all resulting germplasm resources will be freely distributed to interested parties upon request. This project also has a significant outreach component. Not only will it directly support multiple postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates, but it will also contribute to the training of many others, including high school interns. Outreach efforts will be specifically targeted at members of traditionally underrepresented and/or disadvantaged groups. Minority-serving institutions California State Polytechnic University - Pomona and the University of Massachusetts - Boston will serve as feeder institutions for identifying and placing minority student in collaborating labs. Outreach efforts on all participating campuses will also leverage existing, local programs to ensure maximum effectiveness.

Together, the U.S.-Danish team will examine challenges associated with microgrid and power converter architectures that affect current efficiency and reliability. Their approach involves modeling, simulating and experimentally validating newly proposed architectures with arrangements of two- and four-phase microgrids and interfacing power converters. The U.S. team's strengths in modeling and simulation of microgrids and converters complement the Danish partners' expertise in renewable energy systems, power electronics and energy efficiency. With the goal of reducing energy losses while increasing system efficiency, they will start by designing a proof-of-concept setup to emulate an actual microgrid system. The team hopes that their two-phase and four-phase designs will provide a new choice of two ways to move power, either through line-to-line connection or through phase voltages, making it possible to reduce complexity and expense compared to conventional systems requiring larger voltage changes. Specifically, the researchers plan to develop, analyze and validate several designs to demonstrate the advantages, through simulation, design, and experimental tests. <br/><br/>This developmental project fulfills the program objective of catalyzing new international collaboration to advance engineering research on next-generation microgrids for power distribution systems. Preliminary results also are expected to improve our understanding of the potential for new fault tolerant power electronics converters that operate after a fault occurs. If successful, this research could lead to increases in system efficiency with less cost to society and the environment. The ultimate goal is to help build a new electric power distribution system capable of handling more renewable energy sources and more rechargeable cars, at minimum cost and without loss of reliability. Broader impacts also include contributions to the future training of U.S. students, through the preparation of a new IUPUI course, ""Microgrid Systems,"" and by providing one participating Indiana University graduate student with first hand, early career international research experience at Aalborg University in a growing engineering field."

Mediator is a large multi-protein complex that regulates most, if not all, gene transcription by Pol II. It functions as a co-activator by conveying signals from DNA regulatory sequences to Pol II and a set of general transcription factors (GTFs) that assemble at the promoter to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC) for transcription initiation. Mediator is evolutionarily conserved in all eukaryotes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator is composed of 21 subunits, with a total mass of over 1 megaDalton, organized into three three distinct modules, termed Head, Middle/Arm and Tail. Since Mediator's function in PIC assembly is proposed to involve direct interactions with Pol II and GTFs, structural information of functional surfaces within Mediator that interact with GTFs and Pol II is required to understand the mechanisms of Mediator functions. However, the large size and complexity of Mediator has greatly impeded structural studies of these questions. This fundamental bottleneck has been overcome recently by determining a crystal structure of the Mediator Head module at 4.3A resolution. This Mediator module comprises 7 subunits with a molecular mass of 223 kDa and is essential for Mediator function. The Head structure revealed a number of structural features that may be responsible for recruitment and coordination of the PIC. These observations led to the hypothesis that Mediator provides functional surfaces with which transcription factors and Pol II interact to bring about transcriptional regulation. To test this hypothesis, this project will determine functional surfaces by taking a structure-guided mutagenesis approach to improve the resolution of the current structure. Structural and functional studies will be combined to determine how the Head module of Mediator interacts with a module of Pol II. Together, the results will provide a picture of how Mediator spatially coordinates different components of the transcription machinery to facilitate a sequence of event leading to transcription initiation. Such structural and functional insights will greatly transform understanding of gene expression regulation by Mediator.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will provide research training opportunities for Indiana University graduate students and for undergraduate students from Indiana University, Purdue University at Indianapolis through the Life-Health Science Internship program. Research training opportunities will also be available for summer students through the STEM program for undergraduate minority students and the Indy SEED project for underprivileged high school students. Students will learn and implement cutting-edge technologies, including the latest molecular cloning and protein complex engineering technologies, X-ray crystallography, bioinformatics, biochemical assays, and yeast genetics."

Dr Ye is a second-year tenure track Assistant Professor. Metagenomic sequences are vast in number and as obtained in the lab, fragmented and short (due to the limitations of sequencing techniques). The complexity of metagenomics data can also be overwhelming, as it contains sequences (by random sampling) from different individuals of different species, or different strains of the same species living in the same niche. As a result, many of the computational methods that have contributed to the success of numerous individual organismal genome projects are not directly applicable to metagenomics projects. New computational methods need to be developed to optimize the analysis of metagenomic sequence data and advance the field. This grant to Dr. Ye will develop computational protein function annotation of metagenomic sequence data to improve functional annotation of metagenomic sequence data. In this project, software is being designed and developed for improved protein sequence prediction by using ORF (Open Reading Frame) assembly and by specifically designing a gene finder for DNA fragments that can tolerate sequencing errors. Annotations of various biological functions including biological pathways, transmembrane transporters and enzymes are being carried out with computational tools. Exploratory projects are being developed to test several ideas for utilizing metagenomic sequence data to improve function annotation methods. Several computational tools and pipelines, designed specifically for metagenomic sequence data analysis, will be released as open access (e.g., through collaboration with CAMERA). The tools will be available through the Ye lab website:<br/>http://mendel.informatics.indiana.edu/~yye/lab/index.php<br/><br/>As a part of her CAREER award, Dr. Ye will develop highly-integrated activities using metagenomic science as a model for education-research integration.

The 30% attrition rate of new science teachers within IPS and inadequate numbers of new teachers pursuing science degrees statewide are two particular areas of concern that the IUPUI-IPS Noyce partnership is addressing. The goal is to graduate 30 Biology, Chemistry, Physics, or Earth Science teachers over four years, who have earned a STEM bachelor's degree from Purdue University (IUPUI) and also fulfilled the Indiana Division of Professional Standards requirements for teaching Science in grades 6 -12. The Advance Urban Learning: Teach Science project is based on current pedagogy and educational research existing within IUPUI's successful ""Learning to Teach, Teaching to Learn"" program, known for its focus on the challenges of teaching in an urban context. Experienced teachers serve as mentors and host Noyce Scholars in their classrooms. Recruitment efforts focus on attracting minority students into teaching and include a course for freshman and sophomores on exploring teaching as a career. This project broadens and expands the current Robert Noyce Scholarship post-baccalaureate program at IUPUI to include undergraduate Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Earth Science students. Noyce Scholars are future leaders who have undergone extensive preparation in their content areas and are also well-versed in current pedagogical practice, benefiting both colleagues in the profession as well as the students they guide and instruct. This diverse group also serves as future mentors for successive Noyce teacher candidates."

The project takes advantage of a newly available suite of data from a 240-station network of continuous and campaign GPS sites in the Philippine plate boundary zone, collected by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), together with international collaborators. The project builds on a successful research collaboration between Indiana University, PHIVOLCS, and two research institutes in Taiwan. The work will focus on (1) improvement of regional plate motion and intraplate deformation models for the Philippine island arc; (2) evaluation of strain partitioning between subduction-related compression and intra-arc shear deformation in Luzon, including assessment of post-seismic transient effects associated with the large (Mw 7.7) 1990 Luzon earthquake; and (3) assessment of spatially variable subduction zone coupling along the Manila and Philippine trenches and its impact on earthquake potential. This proposal seeks to extend and expand the ongoing studies in Luzon through analysis of existing crustal deformation data, in collaboration with Philippine and Taiwanese counterparts. Tasks include (1) extending kinematic modeling of elastic block interaction to include the entire Philippine archipelago; (2) developing 3-D deforming block models of fault-related deformation at the Philippine Fault and interaction with subduction boundaries; and (3) examining spatially variable coupling along the Manila and Philippine subduction zones through dynamic modeling of subduction-zone creeping and locked segments. The expected models of plate boundary earthquake potential can be used as input for ground-motion and tsunami-generation models.<br/><br/>This project has significant societal impacts in the form of improved methods for detecting fault-related deformation and subduction-zone activity in active plate boundary zones. In particular, these observations will provide critical information for assessment of long-term seismic hazards for the Philippines.PHIVOLCS and other Philippine collaborators provides an avenue for technology transfer to colleagues in the developing world. Because of the large population at risk from future earthquakes and related secondary effects, the research conducted as part of this project could have significant impacts in hazard mitigation for the Philippines.

The research will be conducted at three locations in Indiana, North Carolina and Georgia so that soil and climate effects can be separated, and a combination of observational measurements, controlled experiments in labs and greenhouses, and experiments in the field will be used. <br/><br/>This research addresses important questions about how individual plants, especially invasive species, affect how forests use and cycle carbon and nitrogen. The investigators will also develop a general framework for predicting the impacts of invasives more broadly that will enable predictions of when and where biological invasions will have the greatest effects. As part of this project, the scientists will work with high schools to conduct training programs for teachers in Indiana and Florida that will include the development of new curricula and activities. The project will also train several undergraduate students each summer of the project, will provide an opportunity for a new PhD and Masters students, and will train a post-doctoral associate as well. The results of the project will be made available to land managers, other scientists, and to the general public through a web site, public presentations, and publications. Stiltgrass is one of the most common invasive plants in the forests of eastern North America, so that helping land managers to more efficiently target its removal and restoration efforts will have lasting benefits for conservation and forest restoration projects in the future."

The depth of transcript data accumulating for many plant species under numerous experimental conditions provide unprecedented evidence for the evaluation of all aspects of transcription, including precise mapping of transcription start sites as well as dominant and alternative splice sites. This project engages a team of experts in a wide range of fields, including genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, statistics, machine learning, high performance computing, and software engineering to jointly work toward a solution for accurately predicting the expressed protein-coding gene transcriptome from plant genome sequences. Successful completion of the project will result in the deployment of (1) software that implements the novel prediction algorithms, (2) visualization and data access portals, and (3) a cyberinfrastructure environment implementation of the developed tools for distributed computing, sharing of protocols, and analysis provenance recording. In the long run, the project seeks to explore the extent to which genomic biology can transition from a largely descriptive to a highly predictive science driven by quantitative measurements, with algorithms and computation as the domain-adapted language. <br/><br/>The project will generate standardized, accurate protein-coding gene structure annotation for 25 plant genomes from a wide range of the phylogenetic spectrum. Initial emphasis will be on improved annotation of recently sequenced genomes, which will benefit the entire community of researchers working on these important crops. The anticipated algorithms for transcriptome prediction will be essential to the analysis of the thousands of complete plant genome sequences likely to become available within the next few years. Through the development of reliable gold standard annotations and the dissemination of training and test sets for algorithmic development, a larger community of computational data analysts, in particular from the machine learning community, will be engaged. All software developed and data generated in this research is freely available through project Web sites, in particular www.plantgdb.org. The project's plan for integration of research and education will train a new generation of scientists to work on genomics data with the broad range of interdisciplinary approaches represented by the project team."

Additional theory and methods are needed for analyzing processes and phenomena on the sphere, many of which are of utmost importance in the geophysical sciences. Data from global networks of in situ and satellite sensors, for instance, are used to monitor a wide array of important climatological variables such as temperature and precipitation. The goal of this project is to study random processes on the sphere beyond the usual homogeneity assumption using two approaches. The first approach is to consider axially symmetry on the sphere, where the random process exhibits longitudinal symmetry rather than being rotation invariant on the entire sphere. The second approach of this research extends the intrinsic random functions and generalized covariance functions to processes on the sphere. The notion of intrinsic random functions has been developed in order to handle a process with an unknown and possibly non-constant mean function while preserving a linkage to stationarity. The investigators plan to achieve a fundamental understanding of the covariance structures of the non-homogenous processes on the sphere and to develop associated estimation procedures. In addition, these approaches are extended to more sophisticated situations including multivariate random processes and spatio-temporal processes on the sphere. All of these methods and models are applied to global-scale temperature data from surface and satellite sensors.<br/><br/>The models and methods developed here provide new tools for improving our understanding of global-scale phenomena in general and multi-decadal temperature variations in particular. The motivation of this project comes from a desire to understand the statistical characteristics of global-scale temperature variations during the instrumental (1880s onward) and satellite (1979 onward) periods. As a result, two important and widely used data sets are analyzed here:(1) tropospheric temperature data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite-based Microwave Sounding Unit and (2) surface-based instrumental data from the Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom and Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. The geostatistical analysis of these data sets on the sphere provides profound information on the state of our changing planetary environment. The project also establishes and encourages research and education collaborations between Indiana University and Mississippi State University."

Anderson and Mr. Stephen Yerka of the University of Tennessee, Dr. Eric Kansa of Open Context & the UC Berkeley School of Information, Dr. Sarah Whitcher Kansa of the Alexandria Archive Institute, and Dr. Joshua Wells of Indiana University South Bend. Researchers and land managers at a number of state and federal agencies, public and private universities, and private companies will assist in this effort, both by providing information and evaluating how it may be best used for research and management purposes. <br/><br/>Efforts to collect and compile archaeological data have a long history, and information about archaeological sites and collections is maintained by every state and territory.

Data from some 15 to 20 states (>half a million sites) east of the Mississippi will be integrated using an informatics framework that promotes extensions and reuse by government personnel in state and federal agencies, and domestic and international researchers. Linkage of site file and other datasets will facilitate studies of past human adaptation spanning large areas, and lead to greater collaboration between archaeologists and scientists in other disciplines. As examples, the linkage of archaeological data at broad new scales will permit, for the first time, the exploration of exciting new research topics, such as how the human populations in North America responded to climate change, population growth, and/or anthropogenic environmental issues over the past 13,000 years. <br/><br/>The availability of output online in the form of maps and data tables (at significantly reduced spatial resolution, to protect sensitive locations) will enhance public awareness, education, and appreciation for scientific research in general and archaeology in particular. The demonstration that primary archaeological data can be integrated and used to address fundamental questions at such scales will stimulate similar efforts worldwide. Finally, by creating translating routines rather than dictating procedures, this project will foster archaeological cooperation through cyberinfrastructure with a high ratio of benefits to costs. <br/><br/>The project will help to achieve NSF goals for research and education. It will foster novel networking and data integration among multiple partners, as well as research and educational activities across multiple disciplines and geopolitical boundaries. The project will fund graduate and undergraduate students, and will assist their training in critical information management skills for the 21st century.

Feldspars are the most abundant minerals in the Earth's crust, comprising of more than 50% of the Crust volume. For the former, one global warming mitigation strategy is geological carbon sequestration, for which CO2 is stored in deep underground geological formations. However, the injected CO2 will acidify the native brine and dissolve feldspars in the reservoirs, which could affect the reservoir quality and the long-term safety of storage. For the latter, the weathering of feldspars as an abundant mineral in the Critical Zone is critical to rates of soil development and the buffer capacity of the Critical Zone to stresses. However, to assess how fast feldspar dissolution or weathering takes place (chemical kinetics), we need to wrestle with one of the fundamental challenges in geochemistry. It has been known for a long time that the laboratory measured dissolution rates of feldspars are two to five orders of magnitude faster than rates estimated from field studies. Without resolving this seemingly intractable obstacle, we cannot quantitatively evaluate a number of environmental and geological processes, such as those mentioned above. <br/><br/>This study is designed to test the promising hypothesis that would partly resolve the apparent discrepancy: A large part of the discrepancy between in situ field and laboratory rates results from the coupling of the dissolution and precipitation reaction in the field systems which is absent in most laboratory experiments. Historically, the determination of very slow feldspar dissolution rates in laboratory at ambient temperatures has been problematic. Slow reaction rates mean that solutes may be below analytical detection limits, thus affecting the accuracy of the experiments. Here, the investigator proposes an innovative utilization of newly developed technology - High-Resolution Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry - and uses a novel design of stable silicon isotope 'spikes' to overcome these obstacles in order to determine feldspar reaction rates at ambient and near equilibrium conditions, not previously possible. <br/><br/>The work will involve cooperation among the investigator at Indiana University and his colleagues at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, and at Trent University in Canada. Funding is requested only for the US organization. This study will enhance international and multi-disciplinary collaboration and contribute to the training of a post-doctoral associate and an exchange student from Israel. Te investigator is currently conducting research on the industrial scale CO2 storage project in Norway (the Sleipner project) and will communicate the results from this study to the CO2 storage community and the Critical Zone research community."

During assembly, some viruses will incorporate part of the cell membrane from the host cell into the new virus particles. This project will determine the viral components that are involved in incorporating the host cell membrane during virus assembly. Using Alphaviruses as the model system, this project will characterize specific viral membrane proteins known as 6K and TF that are required during virus assembly, the post-translational modifications required by these proteins to carry out specific functions, how the proteins organize within the particle to create a stable particle, and where in the virus particles these proteins are localized. The proteins being studied from the Alphavirus family are thought to function similarly to proteins in other virus families. Thus, this research could potentially reveal new assembly mechanisms shared by different virus families that are not genetically similar.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS <br/>This research promotes interdisciplinary collaborations and will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from virology, structural biology, and nanoscience programs.

Funds from the Department of State will support participation by scientists from within the region, which will broaden the impact of the workshop. The NSF funds will support travel for US scientists and graduate students working with collaborators in the countries of the LMR and/or collaborating with counterparts in the region, including those from across many NSF divisions. One of the workshop?s broader impacts will include increasing participation by researchers from countries of the LMR in international science and engineering projects. The training provided to both network operators and researchers using cyberinfrastructure tools will be done in a sustainable, train-the-trainer method to encourage ongoing learning."

The primary objective is to determine the total number, specific frequency, spatial distribution, and color distribution of each galaxy's GC system. The data will be used to establish how these properties vary with galaxy morphology and environment, to test models of how galaxies form and evolve, and to constrain fundamental quantities like the redshift at which the first GCs formed in the Universe. The survey data will also be used for two other science applications: (1) follow-up spectroscopy to measure the radial velocities of the GCs and use them to trace the structure of the galaxies and their dark matter halos; and (2) combining the optical images from the survey with X-ray data to study the X-ray sources - including X-ray emitting black holes - in giant galaxies. <br/><br/>This project includes significant components of service to the community, public outreach, and education. In preparation for the survey, Dr. Rhode is leading an effort to produce a well-integrated system for transfer, analysis, visualization and storage of ""One Degree Imager"" (ODI) camera data. The goal is to make it possible for anyone in the astronomical community to analyze ODI data without having to purchase and maintain expensive hardware or write specialized software to work with these large images. The solutions created for the ODI will pave the way for other Gigapixel camera projects and will benefit other disciplines that use large images to do research. Dr. Rhode's team will create high-quality color images of each galaxy with accompanying text and use these to inform educators and the public about galaxies in general and the specific research that is enabled by these types of images. Finally, the survey will allow graduate and under-graduate students to engage in research aimed at exploring some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics and cosmology, using data from a new instrument.

To address this challenge, a self-circulating, self-regulating mechanism is proposed to generate gaseous species from liquid reactants on demand. The system involves little or zero parasitic power consumption and needs no discrete control system for regulation.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>This work seeks to understand the process control and dynamics of an integrated microfluidic gas generator with self-circulation and self-regulation functionalities. This work is expected to establish the engineering and scientific foundation for highly-efficient, autonomous, on-demand gas generation systems for many applications. To achieve this objective, the research efforts will first be focused on fundamental understanding of the reactive multiphase flow in a microfluidic network with the proposed self-regulation, self-circulation mechanism. Catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide will be employed as a basic model system to perform the fundamental studies. The dynamics of bubble-driven liquid circulation, self-regulation, mechanism of gas/liquid separation, and reactant utilization will be experimentally investigated. A comprehensive lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) model will be used to study the physics in the gas generator. Bubble dynamics is a focus for the numerical study. The LBM model and the related numerical simulation will be used to provide benchmarks for the experiments and to guide future designs. The micro reactor configuration will then be tested on two applications: high-performance small fuel cells for portable electronics and energy reclamation/treatment of waste water by MECs. The issues related to these two particular applications will be used to establish the foundation for future commercialization.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>Efficient management and utilization of multiphase flow in microreactors have a broad range of applications. The successful implementation of this research could directly facilitate the development of high-energy-density power generation devices based on fuel cells, where hydrogen storage and delivery remain major technical challenges. The proposed approach may help overcome this problem by achieving autonomous pumping and control for on-demand hydrogen generation with little burden on system complexity and packaging. The work could also benefit a series of portable applications, such as portable electronics, implanted biomedical devices, and distributed microsystems with wireless communication capability. In addition, it could also benefit the development of scalable microbial electrolysis cells for hydrogen generation from renewable energy sources, while cleaning up waste water before its discharge. It is expected to further inspire similar approaches in on-chip cell culturing systems, micro flame ionization detector, solar water splitting systems, etc. <br/><br/>Educational efforts will benefit through the involvement of minority students from the local community. Summer camps will be organized on both campuses to provide local high school students an opportunity to explore the interdisciplinary fields of micro/nanotechnology."

Dr. Hahn is a third-year, tenure-track Assistant Professor. Genome sequencing projects have revealed large and frequent changes between species in the size of gene families. These changes have been shown to be responsible for morphological, physiological, and behavioral differences between species, and to contribute to much of the genetic and genomic diversity we observe in nature. To further understand the importance of these changes, researchers must be able to understand the mechanisms and modes by which gene families evolve. Despite the growing body of data on gene families, until recently we lacked a statistical framework that would allow for inferences regarding gene family evolution among species. In earlier work from his dissertation research, Dr. Hahn proposed such a framework for studying gene family evolution, and showed that it could be used for hypothesis testing, inference of ancestral states, and estimation of gene duplication and deletion rates. This project will be developing novel statistical and computational methods for studying gene families, and examining the biological mechanisms underlying gene family evolution. This work is enabling more refined estimates of gene duplication and loss rates, and will provide new ways for detecting and studying whole genome duplications. Methods for studying gene families from low-coverage genomes will also be developed. Gene duplication can distribute paralogous genes across the genome. Locations of individual genes will allow study of both within-genome and between-genome dynamics of gene families. Lineages differ in their rates of gene turnover which raises the question of how these differences come about. This research is identifying the biological factors determining observed rate variation among lineages and among individual gene families. Dr. Hahn is developing new computational models and free software, which will be available at http://www.bio.indiana.edu/~hahnlab/.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to many fields, including studies of gene and genome duplication to studies of gene regulation, transposable elements, genetic robustness, and RNA interference. As a part of his CAREER project, the PI is integrating knowledge from these diverse fields at high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels to inform biological reasoning and to create new lines of scientific inquiry. Further, the PI will prepare and implement a curriculum for students at a local technology-focused high school. This curriculum will integrate computers into the biology classroom by introducing the basic principles of programming alongside the basic principles of biology."

This is particularly the case in the semi-arid tropics (SAT), which contain 22% of the world's population and high concentrations of chronic poverty and inadequate food consumption. Much of the vulnerability of smallholders within the SAT is driven by surface hydrological dynamics; both directly through rainfall variability and indirectly through additional human- or climate-induced land and water degradation. When crop yields decline due to insufficient or in some cases excessive precipitation, households adopt various coping strategies to survive, many of which have an explicitly spatial dimension. <br/><br/>Tom Evans from the Department of Geography at Indiana University and Kelly Caylor in the Department of Civil Engineering at Princeton University examine the resilience of smallholders in Zambia to climate variability by examining the spatial patterns of water availability and agricultural decision-making. The project particularly focuses on the diversity of coping strategies that smallholders in different locations employ to survive periods of crop failure such as skipping meals, seeking off-farm work opportunities or relying on food aid. The decision and option to choose different coping mechanisms depends on a complex set of social and ecological conditions such as precipitation patterns, surface topography, the spatial distribution of land holdings, social norms within a community and the regional availability of food aid. This project will examine these complex dynamics in two regions of Zambia that present a range of hydrological/climate regimes and socio-economic conditions. Specifically, we will focus on one province with low annual precipitation and relatively frequent periods of drought, and a second province with moderate annual rainfall and less severe seasonal drought.<br/><br/>This research will lead to new understanding of the relationship between hydrological dynamics and the ability of smallholders to respond to climate variability in the semi-arid tropics. While a substantial amount of research has addressed the resilience of systems to understand how societies cope with social or ecological disturbances, the spatial dimensions of resilience have not been fully explored. The results from this research will identify what coping strategies smallholders use in different land use and hydrological contexts and articulate the spatial dimensions of those coping strategies. This project will also develop new methods to identify 'hotspots' of vulnerability given specific scenarios for future climate variability that has implications for development initiatives and food aid distribution activities."

In addition to the development of advanced materials for the anode, cathode, and electrolyte, the structure of the electrodes at the micro- and nano-scales also plays a critical role in determining the performance of a LIB because the electrode?s composite matrix must be designed to provide both electron and lithium ion transportation, which eventually affects the LIB?s voltage, specific capacity, and discharge/charge rate. Currently, a fundamental understanding of the impact of an electrode?s microstructure on LIB performance is still lacking due to the inhomogeneity, complexity, and three-dimensional (3D) nature of the electrode?s microstructure. In this study, a novel approach is proposed to gain greater understanding of the microstructure of the electrode and its impact on the LIB?s physical and electrochemical performances when using liquid electrolytes as well as solid electrolytes (all-solid LIBs). The knowledge gained in this study is expected to help identify the optimal conditions of the composite electrode?s components and microstructure that will yield compact and safe LIBs with high energy and power densities.<br/><br/>This research project takes a unique, interdisciplinary approach using experimental and theoretical analysis tools from the areas of electrochemistry, nanotechnology, transmission x-ray microscopy, material science, and numerical modeling. This work is expected to establish the engineering and scientific foundation for safe and high power/energy density LIBs. To achieve such an objective, the research efforts will first focus on the fundamental understanding of the porous microstructure of the composite electrode and its impact on the electrochemical performance of liquid electrolyte LIBs, followed by exploration into the impact of the electrode?s microstructure on all-solid LIB performances. X-ray nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) with sub-100 nm resolution will be employed to obtain the 3D microstructure of the LIB electrodes. For the first time, synchrotron x-ray nano-CT will be attempted to perform microstructural characterization of the composite electrode and to identify the particle/particle interface in all-solid LIBs. Both liquid electrolyte and all-solid LIB cells with finely tuned microstructure will be designed, fabricated, and characterized in the PIs? labs. A rich array of knowledge will be obtained through systematic experiments regarding the effects of various factors in the LIB electrodes. A comprehensive mathematical model and simulation framework based on the finite volume method will be established to reveal the physical and electrochemical processes in the electrode. The experimental and numerical results will be used to establish the correlations between the LIB?s performance and the electrode microstructure.<br/><br/>The successful implementation of this research would directly facilitate the improvement of current LIBs that use liquid electrolytes and the development of next generation all-solid LIBs. The scientific and engineering knowledge gained from this project will improve battery capability allowing for the widespread use of environmentally sustainable energy sources, especially in ground transportation. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain critical hands-on research experience through this project. Summer camps will provide local high school students and K-12 teachers a unique opportunity to explore the interdisciplinary fields of advanced battery technologies and renewable energy."

Wind turbine wakes in these large arrays are responsible for reduction of total wind-farm power output by up to 20%. These wakes, which encompass the region of decreased wind speeds and enhanced turbulence behind wind turbines, also reduce turbine lifetimes due to increased fatigue loading. <br/><br/>The PIs? previous research has shown that current generation wind-farm models underestimate the magnitude of wind-turbine wakes in large arrays. The main objectives of this project are (1) to improve the physical understanding and modeling of the development of single, double and multiple wakes in a range of wind speed, turbulence, and atmospheric stability conditions, and (2) to assess whether uncertainty in power prediction can be significantly reduced, and array configuration improved, by better quantification and modeling of wind-turbine wakes. <br/><br/>The uncertainty in predicting power output from large wind farms can be substantially reduced by explicit modeling of the interaction between wind-turbine wakes, and between whole wind-farm wakes and the overlying atmosphere. The research will involve advanced measurement and modeling of the factors that dictate wind-farm efficiency, appropriate to the large scales of wind turbines and wind farms currently being deployed. The PIs will focus on the quantification of power losses and additional fatigue loading on downstream turbines due to wind- turbine wakes and comprises three parts: <br/><br/>1) Highly resolved measurements of wind-turbine wakes and associated atmospheric and turbine parameters using Doppler light detection and ranging (lidar). The PIs will conduct measurements in large wind farms using a remote sensing systems to quantify the atmospheric state and continuous wave to accurately quantity both wind and freestream turbulence and their profiles well above tip-heights (150 -200 m) in single, double, and multiple wake situations under a range of atmospheric situations and to provide detailed data on wake behavior under different turbine loading conditions. <br/>2) Data analysis and modeling for multiple wake interaction in large operational wind farms. The PIs have partnered with a number of wind-farm operators to obtain data sets from five large onshore wind farms with a combination of regular and irregular arrays that can be used to evaluate wake behavior in large onshore wind turbine arrays. In conjunction with data collected, this analysis will be used to quantify functional dependencies, and develop model parameterizations of multiple wakes incorporating turbine and atmospheric parameters. <br/>3) Development of a new multiple-wake model. The PIs will develop a new model based on an extension of the numerical wake model developed for single wakes and drawing from the analytical models to include multiple wake interactions.<br/><br/>The PIs? activities are designed to encourage broad participation and scientific rigor in the field of wind-farm modeling by: <br/>1) Expanding the Indiana University virtual wake laboratory to supply wind-farm case study data and time series for modelers to use in model development and evaluation. The virtual wake laboratory is a web-based tool, which supplies data sets that may be used to quantify wind-turbine wakes and to evaluate wake models. <br/>2) Development of wake-model benchmarking in collaboration with international groups to provide better metrics for wind-farm model evaluation and to increase involvement from academia and industry in the process of providing optimal power prediction from wind farms. <br/>3) Train students in wind-power meteorology in collaboration with industry using state of the art models and wind-farm based measurements."

Accurate determinations of hydrogen,<br/>carbon, and nitrogen stable isotopic compositions require a calibration using at least two isotopic RMs (also called standards) having different isotopic compositions to (i) anchor the isotopic scale and (ii) compensate for differences in operation of instruments, which commonly compress isotope scales. The development of suitable organic stable isotope RMs has not kept pace with the rapid development of analytical continuous flow methods. The U.S. traditionally has been an international leader in the development of stable isotopic RMs, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, formerly NBS) now fails to adequately serve the stable isotopic RM needs of the scientific community. As a result, the scientific community is forced to work with temporary laboratory isotopic RMs jeopardizing the mutual compatibility of scientific results among different laboratories. Several of our new organic isotopic RMs will be the first and only RMs for NIST for H, C, and N isotopic calibration of modern gas chromatographic and liquid chromatographic approaches. An additional result of the proposed project will be to recommend improved, accurately calibrated hydrogen isotopic compositions for all inorganic and organic hydrogen RMs relative to the scale-defining international measurement standards. Distribution of newly developed RMs will occur via NIST and IAEA, and also via discounted channels to support NSF-funded applications.<br/><br/>The fields of chemical and biological oceanography, ecosystems, and Geobiology/low-temperature geochemistry use stable isotope analyses as cornerstones for discovery and innovation. They will obviously benefit from having a source of standard materials, so that the results coming from these communities can be precisely compared. Diverse fields beyond geochemistry will benefit from new stable isotopic RMs, e.g. biofuel energy research, forensic tracing of contaminants and animals, biology and ecology (e.g., trophic research), medical science (diagnosing medical disorders), pharmacology (drug authentication), criminal justice (geographic tracing of human remains), and food science (food authentication). The PI has been volunteering in outreach efforts, for example by teaching the Geology Merit Badge to local boy scouts. When the use of stable isotope research was explained to young listeners or the public, the response was always enthusiastic to prominent forensic examples and the fact that RMs from my laboratory at Indiana University are being used by the FBI, EPA, IAEA, U.S. and international customs authorities. Results of this research will also be presented at the IU Crossroad Geology Program, which is an event run by the department?s graduate students aimed at sharing research with undergraduates, graduates from other institutions, and to visitors from industry."

Using products from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Project and state-of-the-art global climate model simulations, Professors Sara Pryor from the Atmospheric Science Program at Indiana University and Justin Schoof from the Geography Department at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale will identify and quantify sources of wind climate variability on time scales from months to decades, and generate uniquely detailed projections of wind climates across the contiguous US under global climate change scenarios using both dynamical and empirical downscaling tools. This research will contribute to improved understanding of spatio-temporal variability in wind speeds, dynamic causes of variability in wind climates, mechanisms responsible for extreme wind speeds, and evaluation of the latest generation of Global and Regional Climate Model simulations. Given the key importance of proper assessment of sources of uncertainty and sensitivity in climate change projections, the relative sensitivity of wind climate projections (defined as spread in projections developed from different scenarios) to key sources of uncertainty will also be developed.<br/><br/>The project is motivated by the need for climate change mitigation and adaptation actions in key economic sectors including renewable energy and critical infrastructure. For example, changing wind climates may have implications for the national goal of obtaining 20% of US electricity supply from wind turbines by 2030. The project will generate better understanding of natural/internal variability of regional wind climates and possible influences of global climate change on regional wind climates and operation of existing wind power plants (to 2035) and quantification of possible longer-term shifts in wind climates, including extreme conditions, over the entire 21st century."

Beyond providing state-of-the-art undergraduate educational opportunities at the PIs' institutions, the project is making the cheminformatics materials available to institutions that wish to participate in the hybrid course wherein a facilitator at each participating institution is responsible for the local students grades and assessment. An additional intellectual merit of this sharing of experience is the latent faculty development that occurs as the non-expert facilitators gain experience in the content delivered by the distant experts. Simultaneously, the community is developing experience in and appreciation of new digital learning modalities that are increasingly comfortable to the new generation of 'free-agent learners'.<br/><br/>The OLCC is leading to the development of modules and digital Teaching and Learning Objects that are coded with meta data, retrievable via national and international archival mechanisms, and which can be repurposed and distributed into other curricular environments. The use of experts distributed beyond one campus or one country is educating current students by a new model that makes traditional boundaries of historical interest only. The on-line component of the hybrid course, with its many-lecturer-to-many-student components, coupled with nurtured student-to-student interactions will aid in the building of a diversified community. The OLCC design is developing modern instructional opportunities that extend beyond the traditional classroom and that industrial learners, non-traditional learners, and distance-learners can all utilize in ways that meet their unique needs."

To improve measurement precision and accurately characterize particle properties, their approach is to measure single particles multiple times and with pores having different dimensions. In this project, simian virus 40 (SV40) is used as the model system. The T=1 SV40 capsid is composed of 12 pentamers and assembles with and without nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) present. Profs. Jacobson and Zlotnick and their students use resistive-pulse sensing, which provides single particle sensitivity in real time and at biologically relevant concentrations. Resistive-pulse sensing combined with rapid on-device mixing permits observation of early time points in the assembly process and the ability to probe pentamers, intermediates, and fully formed capsids without the use of chemical labels.<br/><br/>This project provides a fundamental understanding of how virus-like particles assemble, which is critical in a number of fields, e.g., medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and materials. The measurement techniques developed in this project can be applied to understanding a range of naturally occurring and synthetic assembly systems. Undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to develop state-of-the-art nanoscale fabrication, imaging, and measurement techniques. The project also teaches elementary students about millimeter, micrometer, and nanometer length scales and high school students the concepts of separation and diffusion at the micro- and nanoscale."

The focal animal is a songbird in which populations with separate breeding ranges winter together but differ in whether or not they migrate. When spring arrives the non-migrants begin to breed, while the non-migrants delay breeding despite living in the same environment. Research on the mechanisms that account for different responses to identical environments could help to explain how animals monitor the environment and adjust their physiology to their needs. The dark-eyed junco is a songbird and an ideal model to address these questions. <br/><br/>This project will investigate plasticity in hormone systems using hormonal ""challenges"" and pharmacological manipulations. It will also explore differences in gene expression between resident and migratory juncos from recently diverged populations (California) and longer diverged populations (in Virginia) that over-winter together but breed in different places at different times. The prediction is that migrants will differ from residents in their response to challenges and that recently diverged populations will differ less than populations that diverged longer ago. Another prediction is that gene expression in a common garden will differ between longer diverged populations as compared with recently diverged populations. <br/><br/>Broader impacts <br/>The research will enhance understanding of why and how some animals are able to thrive in changing environments, while other animals' ranges retreat, and some species are lost.

Many enzymes use thiamin, in the form of thiamin diphosphate, as a cofactor to help them speed up biological reactions. Several of these enzymes use pyruvate as a primary substrate, but have evolved to convert it to different products. This project will use directed evolution to generate new thiamin enzymes that use pyruvate. A combination of steady-state kinetics and 1H NMR and CD spectroscopy will be used to determine rate constants for the individual chemical steps in the reactions of these new enzymes and X-ray crystallography will be used to determine the structures of the evolved enzymes. The kinetics of the new enzymes will be compared to those of their naturally-occurring counterparts and related to any structural differences between these two types of enzymes. The goal of the project is to attain a fundamental understanding of the principles guiding the evolution of substrate and reaction specificity.<br/><br/>Most enzymes are very specialized and have evolved to recognize only one or two reactants and form one or two products. This project will explore the way in which an unusual group of enzymes is able to operate in the same manner using the same reactant, but turn the reactant into different products. Understanding this process is significant because this group of enzymes can be used in industrially important reactions. The study will require the evolution of enzymes with altered substrate specificity, and will allow undergraduate and graduate students an opportunity to explore both chemical and biological processes. They will receive training in microbiology, molecular biology, enzyme kinetics, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Importantly, they will also be able to integrate these studies with an outreach component that includes developing a teaching unit and a hands-on enzymology project for middle school students."

King will conduct two field seasons of archaeological research in southern Oaxaca, Mexico. Nejapa is located in the mountainous Sierra Sur and marks the midpoint of a heavily traveled trade route connecting the Mexican highlands to the Pacific coast. For at least 2500 years, armies and traders from highland empires and political centers traveled through Nejapa to try to access rich coastal resources. Not all of these experiences were friendly and mutually beneficial. As is known from archaeological and ethnohistoric sources, Mesoamerica is a world region with a long history of conquest and colonization. While the Mixe, Chontal, and Zapotec peoples in Nejapa clearly experienced Spanish conquest and colonialism, they also endured multiple earlier conquests with potentially greater local impact. In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish, Aztecs were building a large empire, which ultimately encompassed large parts of what is now Mexico. At roughly the same time, highland Zapotecs in Oaxaca embarked on their own hostile takeover of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Nejapa is the place where all of these efforts converged. Initial archaeological research in Nejapa shows that the years between A.D. 1350 and 1650 were incredibly dynamic, with increased numbers of archaeological sites, economic and political diversity, and wider settlement distribution across valleys, foothills, and mountain ridgelines.<br/><br/>Archaeological studies of culture contact and colonialism tend to emphasize interactions between indigenous peoples and Europeans. Despite recent attempts to broaden definitions beyond the realm of first encounters between the Old and New World, in practice, studies often emphasize post-fifteenth century contexts. The intellectual merit of this project is that it breaks new ground by including non-European colonialism and extending the time frame of colonialism earlier and later. The goal is to examine how local sociopolitical relations in rural regions contributed to differential results during multiple conquests and colonialisms by foreigners. Specific questions address the give and take between external and internal political forces, investment in resource-poor high altitude locations, effects of differential access to trade networks on local politics and economics, fortresses and military strategies, and ethnic relations during centuries of political upheaval.<br/><br/>The field work includes two seasons of settlement survey, mapping, and targeted excavations at key sites that span the years A.D. 1350 to 1650. Laboratory analysis consists of geochemical sourcing of ceramics and obsidian, AMS radiocarbon dating, and artifact analysis. This multi-scalar project represents the first part of a longer-term interdisciplinary study of the region's history.<br/><br/>The project has several broader impacts. First, it will facilitate the development of long-term institutional collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico by providing scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students from both countries and by creating ties between Indiana University and agencies in Mexico. The field and laboratory work will also provide valuable cultural resource training to Mixe, Zapotec, and Chontal citizens across the region. Finally, the adoption of innovative methods and technologies for digital data acquisition in high-altitude locations without electricity will be relevant to specialists in various disciplines."

Jarrold from Indiana University to study the interplay between electronic and structural properties of well-defined cluster models used to study the inherently local phenomenon of catalyst-support and catalyst-support-substrate interactions. A three-pronged approach is used to characterize cluster models of new catalysts that have been identified as particularly active toward the industrially-important water-gas shift reaction. (The water gas shift reaction catalytically combines water and carbon monoxide to produce dihydrogen and carbon dioxide.) Anion photoelectron (PE) spectroscopy measurements on model clusters provide a mass-specific electronic profile of the clusters as a function of both metal composition and oxygen content. Cluster structures are determined by reconciling experimental PE spectra with computational results and gas-phase reactivity studies on the clusters allow for the correlation between cluster reactivity and cluster molecular and electronic structures. The first series of studies focus on platinum-containing cluster systems inspired by recent literature. Alternative and less expensive cluster models rationalized to have similar (and possibly improved) attributes are also explored and compared to known industrial catalysts. The broader impacts of these studies include the generation of knowledge that can inform the design of improved, lower-cost and more energy-efficient catalysts for water gas shift reactions and the evaluation of new computational approaches used to study metal oxides in non-traditional oxidation states. In addition, a new generation of scientists are trained to understand industrially-relevant catalysis reactions.<br/><br/>Metal oxides are often used as industrial catalysts. Their composition is often optimized so that the catalysts operate at lower temperatures or with cheaper and more readily available materials. This research project is designed to determine the essential molecular-scale features that govern catalysts used in the water gas shift reaction. The water gas shift reaction combines water and carbon monoxide to make dihydrogen and carbon dioxide. Experimental and computational tools are used to create and study the properties of well-defined nano- and sub-nanometer scale bits of metal oxides used in this industrially important reaction. The technical broader implications of this project include a reduced energy consumption for this industrial process. A more immediate and direct outcome of this project is the training of young women and men in the scientific method using computational and experimental platforms centered on a project that motivated by practical industrial concerns."

Structures in this theme examination of catalytic Bergman vs. Myers-Saito cyclization pathways that are important to radical-mediated chemical transformations; 2) construction of large chromophoric assemblies that use thermal and photochemical Bergman cyclizations to fuse ring systems catalytically to form optically responsive molecules; and 3) incorporation of these reactive ligand sets into large nanoassemblies that can be activated to form all carbon frameworks by template vaporization.

Thermal reaction pathways are evaluated using standard synthetic methodology such as NMR, crystallography, and spectroscopic characterization of reaction intermediates. Optical properties of chromophoric products are examined using nanosecond and ultrafast lifetime and transient absorption methods, while characterization of nanoarchitectures is conducted mainly using electron microscopy.<br/><br/>This research impacts chemical catalysis methodology for constructing new molecules using metal/radical mediated reactions, which is a fundamental need in the chemical community.

Critical to satisfying the countryss needs in the field of high performance computing is the ready access to quality education to train future computational scientists, computer scientists, and design engineers as well as systems' administrators in the application, development, and management of the most powerful computers in the world. The field of HPC as a whole comprises many areas of specialization. But they all share the same common interrelated foundations. This project is developing a new college level course in High Performance Computing to serve as an entry-level introduction for all who wish to enter the field. The new syllabus presents the concepts, knowledge, and skills required by everyone who will be engaged in activities associated with high performance computing. In a closely synergistic manner, the separate topics related to parallel programming interfaces, supercomputer architecture, applications and parallel algorithms, and software environments and tools are combined in a mutually supportive presentation across about two-dozen lectures. Students become familiar with the material through hands-on programming examples and independent exercises for experience with methods and tools, as well as to be exposed to the sensitivity of system operational behavior to a range of alternative approaches and use-cases. Cultural aspects of the field are also shared including the extensive domain specific terminology, the rich history, and key leadership institutions and people. Students who have completed this intense first-year graduate (and advanced senior-level) college course will be capable of proceeding on to advanced areas of specialization, accepting entry-level positions in industry and national laboratories for which computation is of critical importance in fulfilling their mission, or in preparation to guide such courses in the future at home educational institutions.<br/><br/>This course will achieve the widest possible dissemination and impact by being recorded in high definition digital video and made available on-line and on-demand to all who wish to view the lectures. Organized as short segments of between 5 and 11 minutes each, the material is easily viewed and reviewed for best educational experience. Detailed slides to which the lectures are directed are edited into the video stream and made available separately for study. This use of MOOC-like technology will extend the reach of this discipline to many geographic regions and socio-economic groups that do not have ready access to world-class experts and educators in the field of high performance computing but who would greatly value to extend their educational opportunities in these directions.

However, current computational models of semantic learning and representation focus only on linguistic structure. This CAREER award explores how humans use multisensory perception and linguistic experience to organize semantic memory. Dr. Michael Jones at Indiana University will use specially designed web-based experiment protocols to collect large amounts of data about the perceptual structure of word referents. For example, a participant presented with a target word will be required to produce a list of verbal properties to describe the word (e.g., given DOG, a participant might produce ""has four legs, has fur, barks"" etc.). A second participant is then provided with only the list of properties and is required to guess what word is being described. Alternatively, the information to the second participant can be a drawing of what the target word represents to the first participant, who has configured predefined object components into a 2D or 3D display. By designing these experiments as internet based, Dr. Jones will collect very large amounts of data to design and test computer models of linguistic and perceptual integration during word learning. <br/><br/>The models resulting from this research may provide a better understanding of the learning disorders characterized by language deficiencies (e.g. many forms of autism) and age-related disorders characterized by semantic disorganization (e.g., dementias such as Alzheimer's Disease). The integration of perceptual and linguistic information could also lead to better applied algorithms for information search (e.g., Internet search engines) if the computer representation can be made to approximate the semantic representation of the human doing the searching."

Secretion changes over time as cells grow, change structure and function, interact with other cells, and when they become damaged or diseased. Molecules produced by cells play key roles in the growth of embryos, infection, immune response and healing, and in regulating internal body functions despite fluctuating environmental conditions, aging, injury and illness. A tool to measure the types and numbers of molecules secreted by individual cells and their changes in space and time would help researchers understand how cells and organisms function and malfunction, in biomedical, biological and bio-industrial contexts. The tool must be able to sort individual cells based on their secretion behaviors and recover them undamaged for further use, e.g. for tissue engineering or medical treatment. Currently, no technology is simultaneously: 1) Sensitive enough to quantitatively measure many important molecules secreted by single cells at the very low concentrations typical in living organisms, 2) Fast enough to measure changes in extracellular molecular concentrations over periods of minutes, 3) Able to sort and recover live cells for further use, 4) Able to use cells as they occur naturally, without needing genetic modification or an external supply of chemical labels, 5) Capable of quick extension to conduct many different measurements simultaneously on each cell or the same measurement on many cells (high-throughput), 6) Inexpensive enough for wide use in research laboratories, clinics, and industry. The proposed Real Time Secretion-Single Cell Analyzer (RTS-SCA) will be a significant breakthrough that will enable researchers to directly measure secretion dynamics, investigate the degree of variation in secretion behavior within populations of cells and the selection of cells with desired properties. RTS-SCA will find applications in biological and chemical engineering, developmental, immune and cell biology, computational biology, pharmacology and medicine. The technology to be developed is a critical first step towards developing micro- or nano-probes that could later be used as diagnostic tools in living tissues.<br/><br/>Broader impact: Bioengineering, developmental and cell biology, biomedical research, and applied bioagriculture and bioindustry all require a currently unavailable capability to dynamically quantify secretion at the single cell or tissue level. This ability will advance basic understanding of cell functions and interactions, and aid tissue engineering, therapy development and drug discovery. The technology will allow improved versions of common research techniques, such as flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, gene sequencing or microarray analysis.<br/>Immediate applications of the RTS-SCA include the analysis of the key signaling molecules in embryonic development, immunology, wound healing, tissue function regulation, and diseases like cancer, in which both cancer and host-tissue cells send complex chemical messages to each other. Bioengineering and pharmacology need to identify and select particular cells that produce molecules of interest at high levels, and to determine optimal stimulation and culture conditions for molecule production. The RTS-SCA could help in optimizing cell-secretion behaviors, essential for the development of tissue regeneration therapies. The RTS-SCA?s ability to quantify the complex kinetics of insulin release, which involves disrupted pulsatile secretion from pancreatic tissues, could accelerate research in treatments for type-2 diabetes, a disease which accounts for 10% of the U.S. health-care expenditure. Since periodic insulin secretion is an indicator of healthy pancreas function, RTS-SCA would help in selecting tissue fragments for transplant therapy for type-1 diabetes. Dynamic analysis of molecules is especially important in immune system responses and diseases, many of which are mediated by currently unmeasurable time-varying secreted molecules, examples include atherosclerosis, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The RTS-SCA will help understand how immune system cells sense and respond to external challenges facilitating design of more effective treatments and vaccines.<br/><br/>Dissemination Plan: The scientists from Indiana University-Bloomington (IUB) and University of California San Diego (UCSD) have established collaborations with two major research centers, The IUB Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics and The Moores UCSD Cancer Center Microscopy Shared Resource, covering research needs in the Midwest, West Coast, and across the USA. To encourage the RTS-SCA's wide use, each center will receive an operating RTS-SCA.

Traditional parallel programming approaches have relied on static resource allocation and task scheduling through programming interfaces such as MPI and OpenMP. These methods are reaching their efficiency and scalability limits on the new emerging classes of systems, spurring the creation of innovative dynamic strategies and software tools, including advanced runtime system software and programming interfaces that use them. To accelerate adoption of these next-generation methods, a unique environment is being created and operated that provides a comprehensive ensemble of state-of-the-art runtime system software and programming interfaces. Taken from previous research and development projects, some at the host institution, Indiana University, and others from premiere research organizations across the nation, these execution systems are integrated in a single supported Reconfigurable Execution Framework Testbed (REFT) and made available to parallel application algorithm developers as well as researchers in advanced tools for parallel computing. The basic REFT hardware capabilities include a medium- scale heterogeneous Linux cluster with multi-core sockets, high-bandwidth interconnect, and mass storage; field-programmable gate arrays; and instrumentation for power measurement. ParalleX-based HPX-3, ETI SWARM, Berkeley GasNet, Rice University?s Habanero, Illinois? Charm++, Cray Chapel, IBM X-10, and UPC among other programming and execution models comprise the major components of this unique facility.<br/><br/>Supercomputing is making a sharp corner turn in form, function, and methodologies. Unfortunately, few in the field are skilled in the use of the emerging execution and programming models that are becoming increasingly critical to effectively utilizing supercomputers to deliver quality science for extreme-scale applications?either those at the highest end of the performance spectrum (Petaflops currently and Exaflops at the end of the decade) or strong-scaled fixed-size problems. REFT serves the NSF computational science community by dramatically lowering the barrier to training, experimentation, and adoption of new dynamic execution methods and systems. It provides full documentation, on-line tutorials, in-house classes, and workshops for skill development and community building for the broad US HPC community to accelerate application, evaluation, and exploitation. As a repository for competing and complementary software environments it provides a single site for conducting comparative studies by end-users to establish best practices. As an NSF resource, it serves to expedite and further goals of computational science by enabling effective application of the next generation Petaflops-class computer systems of millions of cores and eventual Exascale systems with billion-way concurrency."

Generic extensions of the standard model of subatomic particles predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS), which are excellent candidates for the dark matter. These are expected to interact with ordinary matter rarely and thus be extremely difficult to detect. The COUPP and PICASSO groups are developing new large dark matter detectors derived from the well-known bubble chamber technique. Charged particles traversing the superheated fluid in bubble chambers deposit heat, which creates small bubbles of gas. The bubbles can be photographed before pressurization revealing the paths of these particles. Other non-dark matter triggers can also lead to runaway boiling. These have limited classical chambers to remain in a superheated state for only a short time. The COUPP experiment has paid special attention to material selection and manufacturing techniques to remove roughness and radiocontamination to allow the superheated state to be long lived. The PICASSO experiment suspends superheated fluid droplets in a gel whose surfaces are so smooth that the droplets can stay in a superheated state indefinitely. Both experiments have made the superheated state sufficiently long lived to search for dark matter. <br/><br/>This award will allow the PI to continue his work on the COUPP and PICASSO experiments. The sound sensors produced by the Indiana University group have been used for rejecting cosmic ray induced events and distinguishing the radioactive signals for moderately superheated fluids. The PI and his students have built equipment to test the sound sensors under realistic conditions mimicking those in the detectors and to measure changes in their sensitivity as a function of age. The group has also taken on the task of measuring contaminants in the fluid target and is now prepared to routinely assay the fluid.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Enhancing the education of undergraduates is an integral part of this program. Undergraduates, high school teachers and students have participated in design, construction and characterization of acoustic transducers, measurement of radioactivity, and other projects. In addition, the PI and his group has provided acoustic sensors to other scientific groups to assist in other experiments."

But the data for constructing such maps for the Cambrian and Ordovician Periods, a time of greenhouse climate, are exceedingly sparse for the northern half of the continent, and the Arctic regions in general. This project will improve that situation through detailed study of Cambrian-Ordovician trilobite (extinct marine arthropod) faunas)from the Arctic Alaska Terrane (AAT) of northern Alaska, and the Yukon Stable Block (YSB) of eastern Alaska. It will utilize large fossil collections archived by geologists of the U.S. and Canadian Geological Surveys over the past century, supplemented by new material collected in several key areas in Alaska. The goal for the AAT is to test, by comparing newly discovered faunas from its North Slope Subterrane (NST) with trilobites previously reported from the Seward Terrane (ST) in western Alaska, the hypothesis that the thick limestone succession in the NST was deposited somewhere in northeastern (modern coordinates) North America, whereas the ST originated in or near Siberia. In the YSB, thorough documentation of rocks and fossils in the Jones Ridge Limestone will refine correlation with rocks of the same age in other regions. For many of the horizons targeted for study, the data from Jones Ridge will be the first information acquired from the entire northern half of the continent. The refined time control through this thick (ca. 450m) stack of limestone preserved near the northwestern corner of North America will serve to test the claim of continent wide (and perhaps global) extent for numerous events documented across broad areas in the U.S. and southern Canada, on the opposite side of the continent. These include (among others), 1) a number of significant rises and falls in sea level and 2) episodes of platform-wide suppression of microbial reef development in the aftermath stage boundary extinctions in the late Cambrian. <br/><br/> The scientific results of the proposed project will benefit society by advancing knowledge of the Arctic region, an area rich in vital resources but still a frontier with respect to our understanding of even basic aspects of its tectonic history. Extensive involvement of undergraduate Geology majors and Earth and Space Science Education majors as junior collaborators in the project will produce a cadre of professional geoscientists with exceptional insight and secondary school teachers able to teach science with the enthusiasm and knowledge of someone who has actually done science."

This project will combine evolutionary and physiological approaches to study how sexual differentiation of the brain evolves in relation to sex differences in behavior. The project will address this question by comparatively studying mechanisms that regulate sexual dimorphic signals in a species-rich family of South American electric fish. These animals generate weak electrical signals to communicate information about species, sex, social rank, and motivation. The magnitude and direction of sex differences in electric communication signals vary across species. Sex differences in these signals are regulated by hormones like testosterone and estrogens and by neuromodulators like serotonin. The brain circuit that controls electric communication signals is well-characterized and relatively simple. These features facilitate investigations of how hormone-brain-behavior interactions evolved to produce species diversity in sexual dimorphic behavior.<br/>The project has four goals: (1) to compare sex differences in signals across species and investigate the coevolution of sex differences in different signal components; (2) to determine whether species diversity in sexual dimorphic behavior evolves through changes in the hormonal sensitivity of behavior; (3) to determine whether sex differences in behavior evolve through changes in neuromodulation in brain regions that control communication signals; and (4) to determine whether sex differences in behavior evolve through changes in the intrinsic physiology of brain cells.<br/>Undergraduates will help collect and analyze data and will be trained and encouraged to pursue scientific careers. The project will maintain a robust international collaboration between Indiana University and the National Institute of Amazon Research in Brazil. The project will generate recordings of electric communication signals that will be deposited in a public database and provide resources for research and teaching on animal communication, sex differences, biodiversity, sensory biology, and biophysics."

Like their monometallic counterparts, bimetallic materials often display dramatic changes in their physicochemical properties at the nanoscale. To realize the full potential of bimetallic nanostructures, samples with structural monodispersity on-par with the best monometallic examples are needed; however, it remains a grand challenge to achieve structural and compositional control during the synthesis of bimetallic nanostructures. This challenge arises from reliance on co-reduction techniques to nucleate and grow a defined bimetallic phase, but the Skrabalak laboratory has demonstrated seed-mediated co-reduction as a strategy to overcome the limitations of co-reduction techniques by coupling them with the advantages of seeded methods which provide structurally defined crystals for bimetallic deposition. The aims of this project are i) to identify the synthetic parameters which govern morphology development during seed-mediated co-reduction and quantify their effects on the kinetics of co-reduction and crystal growth, ii) to identify the symmetry relationships between seed structure and the final morphologies of branched bimetallic nanocrystals prepared by seed-mediated co-reduction and quantify the effect of lattice mismatch between seed and overgrowth metals to morphology development, and iii) to identify the synthetic conditions which enable seed-catalyzed co-reduction of metal precursors and quantify the kinetics of this surface-mediated process via in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. Collectively, the experiments being carried out are to identify and quantify the synthetic parameters which contribute to morphology development during seed-mediated co-reduction and enable new architecturally-controlled bimetallic nanostructures to be achieved. Additionally, the optical and catalytic properties of the unique nanostructures synthesized are being studied to understand how composition and architecture compound to impart new functionality. General design criteria for the synthesis of new bimetallic nanoarchitectures by seed-mediated co-reduction are being pursued, as well as the advancement of co-reduction techniques in general.<br/><br/>Bimetallic nanostructures represent exciting multifunctional platforms with the potential to address critical needs in catalysis (e.g., in fuel cells), energy sustainability, chemical sensing, medicine, and beyond. However, predictably achieving architecturally-controlled bimetallic nanostructures has met with only modest success on account of the limitations of current synthetic strategies. This project is to obtain general design criteria for new bimetallic nanostructures and to move the nanosynthesis community closer to the predictive, on-demand synthesis of nanostructures with defined composition and architectures. This research also has the broader impacts of i) forging links between scientific disciplines that include nano/inorganic/solid-state chemistry and colloidal/surface/material sciences, ii) enhancing graduate/undergraduate education through multidisciplinary research and outreach activities that reinforce learning via teaching, iii) introducing nanoscale concepts to non-scientists and connecting undergraduates to their home communities through their research activities; iv) enabling the PI to serve the scientific community as an educator, journal and grant reviewer, and promoter of diversity in higher education; and v) generating and distributing new knowledge based on the proposed research through peer-reviewed publications and presentations."

Present experimental limits allow for undiscovered forces in nature several million times stronger than gravity acting over distances resolvable by the unaided eye. Theoretical models developed over the past few decades that attempt to explain why interactions involving the strong nuclear force always conserve certain spacetime symmetries make specific predictions of spin-dependent forces in the sub-millimeter range. The proposed experiment thus represents an excellent opportunity for discoveries in this range. The experiment uses 1-kilohertz planar oscillators as test masses with a thin shield between them to suppress backgrounds, a technique that has demonstrated the capability to probe micron-scale distances using relatively large (square-centimeter) masses, and to operate at the limit of instrumental thermal noise at room temperature. Spin-polarized materials with high spin density but low intrinsic magnetism, including ferrimagnets that exhibit orbital compensation of the magnetism associated with the aligned electron spins, will be investigated as test masses. With modest aligned-spin densities but good control of magnetic backgrounds, the projected sensitivity of the experiment is several orders of magnitude greater than the current best limits at ranges below 1 millimeter.<br/><br/>Spin is a fundamental property of elementary particles and a crucial aspect of quantum physics. The discovery of a macroscopic force that depends on spin would have enormous implications for physics from subatomic to cosmological scales. A variety of extensions to the Standard Model (the most successful theory particle physics to date, but widely believed to be incomplete) predict short-range spin-dependent forces. These forces are mediated by particles that could contribute to the ""dark matter"" hypothesized to pervade all of space in order to explain the apparent mass distributions of galaxies. The mysterious ""dark energy"" postulated to explain the observed expansion of the universe also seems to point to a length scale on the order of tens of microns as a special range at which previously undetected phenomena might appear. During its execution, this fundamental project will also provide all participants (including several undergraduates who have contributed to this proposal) with experience in mechanical design, vacuum technology, low-noise electronics, semiconductor and magnetic materials processing, and other practical techniques useful in a wide range of science and engineering fields. The experiment will also be a key focus of the Indiana University Center for Spacetime Symmetries (IUCSS), which was founded by the PI and his colleagues to strengthen and publicize IU's growing expertise in the investigation of the structure of spacetime. Success of the proposed experiment will support the IUCSS goal to establish a long-term program of coordinated experimental and theoretical investigation of new physics at sub-millimeter length scales."

The tools involved are partly intrinsic to these areas, but also involve input from other areas, such as combinatorics and algebraic geometry. One important theme is the use of the combinatorial Littlewood-Richardson rule in the study of eigenvalue problems for compact operators on a Hilbert space or for self-adjoint elements in a finite von Neumann algebra. This rule (and its continuous extensions) also plays a role in a different direction concerning the classification of invariant subspaces of certain operators. A second major theme is the study of weak and strong limit laws in free probability, as well as regularity questions for free convolutions. There are many problems here where methods of classical function theory yield interesting, and sometimes unexpected results. Other problems of operator theory to be considered treat the spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem and its analogues, hyperinvariant subspaces, and p-entropies. Of these questions, the Nevanlinna-Pick problem is inspired by control theory questions and may have practical applications, while p-entropies have applications in theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to solve several problems in functional analysis by highlighting their connections to areas of mathematics that do not seem, at first glance, to be related. An example is the use of methods of algebraic geometry in the solution of analysis problems. Some of the areas of study in this project have potential applications in engineering, especially in control theory (specifically, the control of large structures), and earlier results of the principal investigator have actually been incorporated into engineering projects. Besides their purely scientific merit, the activities supported by this grant are expected to have an impact through the training of doctoral and postdoctoral students and the creation of new course materials that will incorporate some of the research findings from the project. The principal investigator has trained a number of Ph.D. students, of whom three are women and one is Hispanic. The work of these students has had a significant impact on the fields that they entered (operator theory, free probability, control theory, and partial differential equations). The principal investigator has also mentored several postdoctoral associates who went on to successful careers. Finally, the principal investigator has directed two undergraduates in the Indiana University REU program. As indicated, mentoring activities at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels will play an integral role in this project."

This work addresses one of the most challenging problems in modern theoretical chemical physics: the combined computational study of electronic structure and nuclear dynamics. QWAIMD involves the simultaneous dynamics of electrons and nuclei though the synergy of quantum wavepacket dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics. It allows the computational implementation of a ""self-contained black-box"" technique for dynamics of electrons and nuclei that does not require a priori knowledge of the potential energy surface. These novel methods are being used to study the vibrational properties of hydrogen bonded clusters. <br/><br/>One of the most challenging issues in modern theoretical chemistry is determining the proper way to combine the inherently quantum mechanical description of the electrons in molecules with the description of molecular motion. Molecular motion is commonly treated using classical mechanics but in many cases quantum mechanical treatment is necessary. This work addresses the issue of how simultaneous quantum treatment of electrons and nuclei can be achieved. If successful, the work will have wide impact on the development of proper descriptions of a number of important application topics including hydrogen transfer reactions in biological enzyme systems, solvation assisted kinetics in atmospheric reactions and hydrogen transfer in fuel cells. The work is, thus, expected to have a broader impact in biology, atmospheric science and materials chemistry and, through the PI's extensive outreach work, on students from under-represented minorities."

However, in contrast to most mammalian cells which are well characterized by this paradigm, the underlying migration processes of weakly adhering cells with less prominent cell substrate linkages, such as leukocytes and certain cancer cells, remain elusive. This type of migration is known as amoeboid migration and is characterized by relatively rapid cell body translocation, enhanced plasticity, and pronounced cellular shape fluctuations. The current proposal seeks to explore underlying processes of amoeboid migration by the use of a novel biomembrane-mimicking cell substrate that allows the systematic variation of viscous drag of cell linkers without permitting formation of tensile force-carrying focal adhesions. By varying the viscous drag of cell-substrate linkages, as well as by selective modification of protrusion and contraction forces using pharmacological agents, this experimental system will enable the PI to determine the interplay between adhesion, contraction, and protrusion forces during amoeboid migration. Tuning of the viscous drag of cell linkers will be accomplished using a stack of multiple polymer-tethered lipid bilayers of adjustable bilayer number on a solid support. Specifically, the PI proposes migration studies in the presence of two types of cell-substrate linkages: (1) cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicking integrin-laminin linkages (Specific Aim 1) and cell-cell mimicking cadherin based linkages (Specific Aim 2). Cell morphologies, cell migration velocities, cellular shape fluctuations, and cytoskeletal organization will be monitored using complementary optical microscopy methods.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The proposed biomembrane-mimicking cell substrates system represents a powerful tool to explore poorly understood properties of weakly adhering cells under well-controlled conditions. These substrates also have substantial translational potential in biomedical cell assays, including drug screening, as they may mimic native tissue environments more realistically than currently existing substrates. Biosensor applications are also envisioned because the enhanced distance between top bilayer and underlying solid in multi-bilayer stacks will likely improve the functional reconstitution of membrane proteins. `The interdisciplinary character of the project will provide excellent training for graduate and undergraduate students. The PI will remain committed to the training of a broad pool of students with diverse social, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. The PI will also expand previous outreach activities at the high-school level and through the IUPUI Nanoscale Imaging Center. In addition, research results from this project will be developed into undergraduate and graduate courses in physical chemistry and biomimetic chemistry. Research will also be disseminated via scientific meetings, peer-reviewed journals, as well as via the internet."

Such mechanisms that integrate sets of correlated traits can potentially constrain further evolution of traits, limiting changes that can occur. The project will detail how sets of correlated traits may be ""pulled apart"" by analyzing physiological mechanisms underlying suites of correlated characters. The project will study twelve closely related species in a genus of lizards in which there are repeated origins of a specific novel trait. The project will study physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying the coevolution of visual and chemical communication, assessing traits involved in signal production and signal reception. The PIs will also develop statistical methods needed to analyze data on correlated traits when the study species are closely related. The resulting software enabling such statistical analyses will be made freely available online for use by other researchers. There are diverse broader impacts. First, undergraduate and graduate student will be trained and they will collaborate with researchers in biochemistry, molecular biology, neurophysiology, animal behavior, evolutionary biology, and biostatistics. Second, the funding will enhance infrastructure for research and education by establishing collaborations between researchers in different disciplines and institutions within the US, and also in Mexico where many of the study species occur. Finally, the PIs will enhance scientific and technological understanding by the public by 1) collaborating with two Indiana science museums to establish displays based on the funded research; 2) making data available by means of an existing online database service (Ethosource); and 3) connecting research outcomes with ongoing outreach activities that the PIs have established with local K-12 science teachers to assist in developing teaching units related to the science topics involved in the project."

Conventional on-screen visual displays may not work well, if at all, in many situations. The most obvious instances occur when persons who are blind or visually impaired need to use technologies designed for sighted users. A much more common situation, however, occurs with users of mobile devices. These users are often engaged in another activity (e.g., walking around a city or driving a car) where it is inconvenient, distracting or even dangerous to continuously look at the screen. On the one hand, Web accessibility guidelines have focused on ensuring that websites are readable by assistive technologies (screen readers). On the other hand, recent aural browsers enable a more intelligent visual-to-aural transformation of specific features of Web pages. These advances, however, do not fully address the larger issue of aurally navigating complex information architectures. Previous work by the PI has shown that an effective aural experience requires the elaboration of new navigation patterns in order to overcome the limits imposed by the linearity of the aural medium. The PI will build on these preliminary results in the current project, in order to provide an advanced level of usability for audio-based web interactions. He will explore conceptual design patterns for aural navigation, by iteratively creating and refining aural design strategies inspired by the structural paradigms of human dialogues for back and history navigation, and browsing in large collections. A series of evaluation studies involving both visually impaired participants using screen readers and sighted participants using mobile devices will assess the potential and limits of the aural navigation paradigms to enhance the effectiveness of Web navigation. <br/>.<br/>Broader Impacts: This project will directly involve blind users in the design and evaluation of new aural design strategies, in collaboration with the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ISBVI). Project outcomes will yield a better understanding of the design issues and solutions for aural navigation, which will provide a solid long-term intellectual basis for the creation of better applications for visually-impaired users and for audio-only navigation contexts. In addition, the PI will work proactively to expand student participation in the research enterprise on his campus, by establishing user experience undergraduate labs."

Recent evidence from both tropical and temperate forests suggests that host-specific pathogens play a major role in shaping forest community development at seedling stage, especially for less abundant species. The seedling to sapling transition is a critical stage of the tree life cycle that will determine forest community composition for years to come. The goal of this project is to determine, using experiments in natural forests and the greenhouse, the role of pathogens in determining the outcome of the seedling to sapling transition in relation to the plants' proximity to adult trees of the same species. Seedlings and saplings will be sampled in three different forests where all trees greater than 1 centimeter diameter have been mapped and tagged. These forests in Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin will provide a broad geographic sampling of eastern temperate forests. The survival and growth of seedlings and saplings of several species will be tracked for two years to determine their rates of mortality and growth around randomly selected adult trees. The results will inform species selection for greenhouse studies to determine the factors behind seedling success or failure in the forests. The researchers predict that rare species in the community will be more affected by pathogens in the early life stages than more common species.<br/><br/>Forests are vital to a sustainable human society and provide an essential renewable resource. It is therefore important to understand how forests grow and develop. This research will inform conservation and management efforts of forest systems by highlighting the role that pathogen-driven mortality has in structuring forest communities. Additionally, it will provide evidence on how forest regeneration may be affected by climate change by examining the regional differences in species performance across a latitudinal gradient. Finally, the researchers will continue their outreach partnerships with local and national land conservancies to educate the public on the results of this research and the importance of forest in general."

Phase 1 consists of a 3-year longitudinal and experience-sampling study of women and men in 3 theoretically informative college contexts: (a) a large, public university (University of Illinois, Chicago), (b) a women?s college (Mills College), and (c) a polytechnic university (California State Polytechnic University). With the public university serving as an ecologically-valid comparison group, the researchers will investigate several situational cues (e.g., numerical representation, gender of professors, explicit institutional values of women and/or STEM, etc.) to identify the ones that most impact women's STEM outcomes. This work assesses critical time periods in students' college careers (years 1-3) when they appraise the cues in their new environments, decide upon a major, take major-related courses, and select career options. The data are analyzed using HLM techniques.<br/><br/>Phase 2 consists of six experimental laboratory studies that investigate the causal mechanisms by which cues affect women's STEM outcomes. In particular, they test whether the orientations that academic institutions adopt towards STEM abilities and learning moderate the extent to which situational cues affect women's STEM outcomes. Two sets of institutional orientations, drawn from the literature, are investigated: (a) fixed v. malleable lay-theories of STEM ability, and (b) competitive v. cooperative orientations. Because STEM settings are complex and likely to contain more than one situational cue, the experiments will investigate these orientations within the context of other cues known to negatively affect women in STEM (e.g., numerical under-representation, gender-segregation, and the congruence between an individual's and an institution's orientation). It is hypothesized that institutional orientations that facilitate effort and persistence while guarding against performance concerns--namely malleable (v. fixed) theories of STEM abilities and a cooperative (v. competitive) environment--will ameliorate the negative effects of under-representation and gender segregation on women's STEM outcomes. Data are analyzed using ANOVA and linear regression techniques that allow for tests of causal mechanisms. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The project offers direct examinations of how situational cues influence women's interests, aspirations, persistence, and performance in STEM. This work has potential to illuminate aspects of STEM settings that negatively influence women's STEM outcomes and provide specific, concrete, and easily adaptable strategies that can be used in STEM classrooms and to train STEM faculty and students. By providing strategies for both institutions and individuals, this work is poised to provide insight into how equitable and inviting STEM environments can be created. The findings will be actively disseminated in psychology and education journals and at national conferences. A website will also be developed to enable broader dissemination. In addition, the findings will be actively shared with STEM educators at both the high school and university levels. The project fosters the integration of research and education as undergraduate and graduate research assistants are involved at every stage. Women and members of underrepresented groups will be recruited as undergraduate and graduate research assistants."

This work will further the use of biological systems for the inspiration, design, and synthetic implementation of functional materials. The specific aims of this work are to: (1) develop programmed co-assembly of a viral capsid with a range of enzymatic cargos including lactonases for disruption of quorum sensing in bacterial biofilms, (2) evaluate the effects of molecular crowding on the activity of the encapsulated enzymes, and (3) co-assemble multiple enzymes into the viral capsids that can chemically communicate with each other to create bio-inspired nanoscale reactors. The enzymes of interest have been selected for their extreme thermal stability commensurate with their use as materials building blocks. In addition, this effort will train a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students in this inherently green chemistry approach to nanomaterials synthesis that incorporates the remarkable materials properties already utilized by nature.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: This research has the potential to enable significant progress in the emerging fields of biomaterials, nanotechnology, and nano-manufacturing. Biological control mechanisms used by natural systems will be exploited to create novel materials and devices exhibiting genetically programmed synthesis in a biomimetic approach to making functional materials. The abundance and unique qualities of these new viral materials will enable researchers to develop new active bio-materials. Integral to this project is an innovative science outreach program developed by the PI that creates meaningful outreach experiences where undergraduate and graduate students learn to communicate effectively their research and their passion for science. The outreach infrastructure that has been developed and piloted provides a template for faculty and students to effectively share their interest in science through hands-on, inquiry-based events. Outreach events will take place in K-12 local public schools and with rural and predominantly Native American schools. They include site visits as well as hosting on-campus events. The fundamental goal of this outreach program is to place active researchers in the front line of community interaction. These events ultimately result in basic science exploration, introduction to current research trends and local projects, and most importantly, contact with active researchers who become role models and recruiters of the next generation of learners."

Complex and specialized ""oxygen sensing"" cells in vertebrate airways and blood vessels have been developed to ensure oxygen delivery to the body as well as its distribution to every tissue. It is not known, however, how these cells sense hypoxia or how this signal initiates subsequent physiological responses. Through previous support from the NSF (IOS 064-1436) the PI's laboratory has provided evidence for a new mechanism of oxygen sensing based on intracellular metabolism of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In this model, H2S is continuously produced by cells and rapidly oxidized (inactivated) when oxygen is present. However, in the absence of oxygen, H2S accumulates and this initiates a cascade of physiological responses. This project will examine the effects of hypoxia and H2S on isolated vessels and tissues, quantify the biochemistry of oxygen dependent H2S metabolism, and identify the intracellular sites of H2S production and inactivation. Vertebrates with wide-ranging evolutionary, environmental, and physiological attributes will be examined including the hypoxia tolerant and most primitive vertebrates (hagfish and lamprey), reptiles (alligators and turtles), hypoxia tolerant diving mammals (seals and sea lions) and hypoxia intolerant fish (trout) and mammals (rats and cows). <br/><br/>These studies will examine whether H2S-mediated oxygen sensing is a fundamental and universal attribute of all vertebrates and this information will be invaluable in understanding the pathophysiology of hypoxia, be it environmental, tissue, or intracellular in origin.

The strong interaction sector of the Standard Model is described by the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as a quantum field theory of quarks and gluons. Such quarks and gluons are deeply confined in normal matter. However when normal matter is heated to a high enough temperature, it changes into a new deconfined form of QCD matter directly made of the quarks and gluons. Such a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) briefly occupied the Universe at about a few microseconds after the ""Big Bang"", and has now been (re-)created as the hottest matter ever in laboratory by heavy ion collisions (""Little Bang""). Its properties are measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the quark-gluon matter created in heavy ion collisions is strongly-interacting both prior to and after reaching thermal equilibrium. Exactly how such strongly interacting nature arises in the many-body setting from the fundamental QCD theory, is a challenging problem that lacks a deep understanding. This project will investigate this missing link and seek to develop effective descriptions of the matter both in and out of equilibrium. The results will advance our understanding of QCD confinement, provide fresh insights into jet quenching mechanism, make significant progress in search of QCD topological effects, and reduce existing uncertainties on the pre-thermal stage. The expected outcome will contribute to our understanding of fundamental questions such as ""how the color confinement phenomenon arises"", and ""how the experimentally observed properties of the quark-gluon matter in and out of equilibrium emerge from QCD"".<br/><br/>The study supported by this award concerns the exploration of new forms of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These activities embody important interdisciplinary aspects, as they are expected to have a profound impact on other areas of physics, ranging from cosmology, supernova, compact stars, to supersymmetric theories, string theories as well as condensed matter physics. This project integrates research with education through mentoring of graduate, as well as undergraduate students. This project will actively pursue a five-year educational outreach plan to develop educational software for computer desktops and mobile devices that utilizes visualization and simulations to demonstrate concepts related to the ""Physics of Extreme Matter"" in an interactive, engaging, and children-friendly manner."

Among the various alternative systems for energy production, fuel cells are particularly attractive because they allow clean and efficient conversion of chemical energy into electricity. Currently, the most active catalysts for the oxidation of fuels such as hydrogen, methanol and ethanol in fuel cells are Pt and Pt-based materials, which are too expensive for affordable clean energy production. This research project focuses on catalysts based on cheaper materials for fuel oxidation reactions in fuel cells. By combining electrochemical measurements, in-situ spectroscopic characterization, density functional theory simulations and fuel cell testing, the collaborative team studies reaction mechanisms of hydrogen, methanol and ethanol oxidation reactions (HORs, MORs and EORs, respectively) on various catalysts in both acid and alkaline media. New multi-functional catalysts based on low cost materials (such as palladium, nickel and other more earth abundant elements) with comparable reactivities to platinum-based catalysts are designed and characterized.<br/><br/>This project is performed in collaboration with Professor Hebe de las Mercedes in Brazil and Professor Shi-Gang Sun in China. Together, these groups combine their separate areas of expertise to examine less expensive and more sustainable fuel cell catalysts.

Viewed analytically, some of the projects seek to understand the structure and fluctuations of the maximum, or minimum, of a collection of correlated random variables; this applies not only to questions of geodesics and estimation of variance in first-passage percolation, but also to the organization of spin glass states. On the other hand the techniques have a geometric flavor, including tools from ergodic theory and Bernoulli percolation.

It also crosses major Proterozoic sutures and the enigmatic Eastern Granite-Rhyolite province. The study is intended to address seven fundamental tectonic issues: (1) structure of intracratonic uplifts and basins; (2) Proterozoic assembly of the North American cratonic platform; (3) deep structure of intracontinental rifts and fault-and-fold zones; (4) lithospheric controls on intraplate seismicity; (5) deep structure of the midcontinent?s unusual anorogenic granite-rhyolite province; (6) structural and lithospheric controls on ?cratonization? of the North American platform; and (7) understanding the nature of the strong gravity and magnetic-field anomalies in the region. <br/><br/>The project is focused on operation of a three-dimensional, broadband, passive seismic array centered over the Illinois Basin.

This project links functional anatomical traits in mammals and reptiles to temperature, precipitation, and vegetation cover using a Bayesian framework that allows us to explicitly test these vertebrate environmental proxies against independent pedogenic and paleobotanical evidence in order to reconstruct paleoclimates of the North American interior during the Miocene. We build estimates of paleoenvironment from entire faunas rather than individual species in order to combine the predictive strengths of ectotherms (reptiles) and endotherms (mammals). Our objectives are: (1) assemble a database of functional traits from Miocene vertebrate fossils at the local assemblage and biocenosis scale in the central Great Plains based on the extensive fossil collections of the Nebraska State Museum and biomolecular proxy data from select fossil localities; (2) develop Bayesian probabilistic climate spaces from sampled traits in modern faunas; (3) use the trait-climate spaces to estimate Miocene paleoenvironment and test for consilience between vertebrate estimates and independent proxies; (4) use the trait-based proxy results to test competing hypotheses of mid-continental floral composition and to determine the extent of coupling between global climate change and local environments during episodes of warming and cooling. This study is the most taxonomically and anatomically comprehensive analysis of faunal traits ever performed on a continuous terrestrial vertebrate fossil record, and our method can be extended to other proxies (stable isotopes, biomolecules, paleoflora) as a general method for paleoenvironmental estimation. We will generate paleoclimate profiles through the Miocene that can be used to test General Circulation Models and to forecast regional impacts of future anthropogenic global climate change. <br/><br/>Non-technical description. This project uses the relationship between the physiology and ecology of living mammals and reptiles to their modern environments to reconstruct the past climates and environments of the interior of North America during the Miocene Epoch (5.3 to 23.0 million years ago) using the fossil record. We will use the functional properties of different living and fossil species that are represented by their skeletal anatomy, such as method of locomotion, dietary specializations, and physiological regulation of body temperature, to reconstruct temperature, precipitation, and floral composition during known histories of global climate change. This approach provides paleontologists with a sophisticated way of understanding the geographic complexity of environmental change using fossils and it provides a record of what changes actually occurred in the Miocene. We will develop a new statistical framework for conducting such research that allows us to determine the relative probabilities of different past climates. For example, environmental temperature and precipitation are correlated to body size and tail length in modern snakes and correspond to the relative proportions of ankle bones in modern carnivorous mammals. By measuring these traits in fossil assemblages, we can statistically estimate past climates based on the relative probabilities of different temperature and precipitation values from both snake and mammals. Our method allows us to better assess the complex relationship between organisms and changing climate at both local and global scales, and will provide precise past climate values that can be used to test General Circulation Models and refine the ability to forecast future climate change. <br/>In addition to increasing our understanding about these important issues, the funds spent on this project will provide training in geology, anatomy, computer programing, and mathematics to university undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, it will contribute to scientific conferences and museum exhibits for the general public."

Supercomputers conventionally operate in dual or separate modes: one to do the computations in their temporary (ephemeral)-main memory-and the other to supervise the use of large persistent data storage. As supercomputers get larger, perhaps to the scale of an Exaflops by the end of this decade, the comparable scale and ease of use of mass storage is severely challenged. This research will address the problems of efficiency and scalability of data migration through the vertical memory hierarchy and will unify the way both main memory data objects and persistent storage data are named creating a single, easy to use programming. This will revolutionize data intensive supercomputing and establish a new path towards future Exascale system design and programming. This research is in collaboration with Clemson University to provide a proof-of-concept system to evaluate the new concepts.<br/><br/>The semantic and performance barriers between computing in main memory and manipulation of mass storage for persistent data have imposed significant limitations to performance and programmability. Because of uncertainties of access latency times combined with overheads and the need to exploit data access parallelism for high throughput, a new relationship between ephemeral storage and persistent objects is needed to unify their association and manage the asynchrony of operation while achieving high efficiency. This research is deriving an innovative execution model and developing a proof-of-concept experimental system to test and evaluate its underlying concepts for a new generation of persistent mass storage at extreme scale. It will address the challenges and provide the means for the unification of the semantics of ephemeral and mass storage through a single abstraction of data manipulation and the integration of meta-data and synchronization to manage asynchrony and uncertainty of response time as well as logical conflicting accesses while automatically hiding latency. The new model will support dynamic data path management for the asynchronous vertical storage hierarchy, exploiting adaptive runtime event-driven techniques for enhanced efficiency and scalability including management of vertical transport of data, which demands an innovative strategy of dynamic control of the entire data path."

Our understanding of alkamide function in plants is in its infancy, but recent data suggest these compounds may have novel signaling functions in addition to insecticidal properties. This work will lay the foundation for further studies of the importance of these compounds in plant biology as well as open up research on this plant genus which has been used medicinally for hundreds of years. Because the pathways in alkamide biosynthesis involve amino acid metabolism and novel chemical linkages, there are also multiple future biotechnological applications for the enzymes involved. The proposed research will strategically apply high-throughput global profiling technologies to elucidate this natural product biosynthetic pathway. Alkamides appear to be biologically assembled via a modular metabolic pathway that may be an adaptation of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Experiments that combine metabolite profiling, metabolic flux studies and transcriptomics will be used to identify genes and enzymes that assemble a diverse collage of alkamides. Defining the alkamide pathway offers the potential of discovering new metabolic processes that generate novel combinations of chemical functionalities, which have wide-ranging applications (e.g., lubrication and detergent industries). In addition, this research project outlines a general methodology that should be broadly applicable to discovering how primary and specialized plant metabolism are juxtaposed and evolve to generate the physiochemical phenotypic differences among plant taxonomic groups. The multilayered bio-prospecting to be used offers the opportunity to browse the metabolic repertoire of an organism, and the system-wide knowledge of the involved biochemical processes should translate to the creation of novel bio-derived compounds relevant to the chemical industries, as well as strategies for pest resistance.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This project will facilitate a multidisciplinary partnership between IUPUI, ISU researchers and scientists at the USDA North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station.

The MESUR project has, over the course of the past 2 years, captured a significant sample of the world?s scientific activity, via a collection of more than 1 billion article-level usage events acquired from some of the world's most significant publishers, aggregators and university consortia. The Eigenfactor project has demonstrated the power of mathematical network models (cf. Google's PageRank) to rank disciplines and journals according to the lattice work of scientific citations that records the collective history of S&E research. Predictions of the ""flow"" of scientific activity have been used to produce detailed maps of scientific activity that may identify potential foci of scientific innovation.<br/><br/>This project expands the Eigenfactor models to include MESUR's indicators of actual, real-time scientific activity. On that basis the project develops a set of early indicators that can detect the emergence of scientific innovation in real-time - before such trends are visible in citation data - and relates these indicators to public policy and decision making. The project also develops explanatory and predictive frameworks that connect observations of individual behavior with emergent, collective phenomena such as scientific innovation. Since the focus of the research is whether it is possible to develop analytic and predictive tools that indicate why, how and where scientific innovation is most likely to occur, the existing eigenfactor.org services will be leveraged to produce freely available, expandable tools that rank, analyze, predict and chart areas of scientific innovation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: this research project produces freely available, expandable services to form an ""early warning"" system for scientific innovation that are expected to lead to a better public understanding of science as a complex, dynamic system. Such services should foster public participation in efforts to establish a more diverse, innovative research landscape that can meet the challenges of the 21st century."

For example, recent advances in acquiring multi-modal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Major computational challenges are, however, bottlenecks for comprehensive joint analysis of these data due to their unprecedented scale and complexity. This project will employ the new capabilities of large-scale data mining techniques in multi-view learning, multi-task learning, and robust classification to address critical challenges in systematically analyzing massive multi-modal genetic, imaging, and other biomarker data. Specifically, this project will: (1) develop new multi-view learning methods to detect task-relevant phenotypic biomarkers from large scale heterogeneous imaging and other biomarker data, (2) implement new sparse multi-task regression models to reveal the genetic basis of phenotypic biomarkers at multiple levels (e.g., SNP, haplotype, gene and/or pathway), (3) design novel robust classification methods via structural sparsity for outcome prediction using integrated genotypic and phenotypic data, and (4) package these new methods into a data mining toolkit and release it to the public. <br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this project derive not only from the development of novel data mining methods, but also from their application to imaging genetic studies. These methods are designed to take into account interrelated structures among multiple data modalities and offer systematic strategies to reveal structural imaging genetic associations. The proposed methods and tools are expected to impact neurological and psychological research and enable investigators to effectively test imaging genetics hypothesis and advance biomedical science and technology. In addition, the proposed data mining framework addresses generic critical needs of large-scale data analysis and integration and, therefore, will impact a large number of research areas where high-value knowledge and complex patterns can potentially be discovered from massive high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets. This project will facilitate the development of novel educational tools to enhance several current courses at UT Arlington and IUPUI. Both universities are minority-serving institutions, and the PIs will engage the minority students and under-served populations in research activities to give them a better exposure to cutting-edge scientific research."

Funds are provided to test the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications. The research will provide a framework for understanding the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental scales. The research encompasses datasets ranging from household surveys to regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to determine how household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions, land management practices and ecological structure and functions at local, regional and continental scales.

Peatlands are wetlands that accumulate carbon because high water tables inhibit decomposition. More extreme summer drought in recent decades has caused large mid-summer declines in peatland water tables. Lower peatland water tables could cause carbon dioxide release to the atmosphere by accelerating peat decomposition and, in addition, cause changes in peatland plant community composition and microbial assemblages. In this study, a peatland mesocosm facility, where both water table and plant communities can be experimentally controlled, will be used to assess how water table and vegetation combine to affect microbial communities and carbon cycling in peatlands.<br/><br/>Peatlands represent 3-5% of the land surface, but harbor 12-30% of global soil organic carbon. This large amount of carbon is vulnerable to release back to the atmosphere if environmental conditions change. Insights from the proposed work will provide options for natural resource management and inform ecosystem models describing the plant communities, microbial dynamics, and carbon storage or release within northern peatlands in the face of climate change.

It is expected that further analysis will reveal connections with various other fields of mathematics. Second, the question of differentiability and boundedness of singular integrals along vector fields has gained a huge momentum over the last five years.

Given the expansive forest cover and relatively high particle deposition velocities over forests, the role of forested ecosystems in removing aerosol particles is drawing increased attention in a number of scientific disciplines and regulatory agencies. However, significant uncertainties remain due to: (1) difficulties associated with field measurements of particle size resolved fluxes and mean concentrations, (2) lack of detailed and simultaneous measurements of the canopy medium and, more importantly, foliage surface characteristics, and (3) challenges in describing all the main features of the transporting agent (turbulence) within and immediately above the canopy. This project will address three key aspects of particle deposition onto forested surfaces using a combined experimental and modeling approach at multiple hierarchical scales (leaf-to-canopy) by exploring: (1) the relative importance of, and correct descriptions of, the foliage collection mechanisms at the leaf scale, (2) deposition flux partitioning between foliar and non-foliar elements, and (3) up-scaling results from aspects [1] and [2] to the entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>Canopy scale size-resolved particle fluxes and mean concentration profiles will be measured in a diverse array of forested sites (conifers and broadleaf) endowed with ""idealized"" micrometeorological conditions and in controlled experiments in an environmental chamber. Findings from these experiments will guide the development of new particle collection schemes at the leaf level by accounting for leaf surface properties, turbo- and thermophoretic components. Also, how to upscale these results to the canopy level from measurements that can now be acquired from remote sensing platforms (e.g. leaf area density) using multi-level and particle size-resolved canopy turbulence closure models will be explored. The model results will be evaluated at three forested sites using size-resolved mean particle concentration profiles and two-level eddy-covariance particle flux systems positioned above the canopy and in the understory.<br/><br/>This project will provide improvements in process-level understanding of particle dry deposition and for mechanistic descriptions suitable for application in a range of numerical models from earth system models to regional scale air quality models.

One powerful mechanism that leads to the maintenance of diversity is ""nontransitive interactions."" Nontransitive interactions occur when the dominance relationships among three or more players are not hierarchical, such that A>B, B>C, and C>A. Because no one competitor is superior to all others, diversity can be maintained in the absence of environmental variation. These interactions are thought to be important in preserving both species diversity and genetic diversity within species. Nevertheless, few studies have linked variation observed in nature with empirical tests of theory. The proposed work examines natural isolates of the insect-parasitic bacterium, Xenorhabdus bovienii. Assays of the bacteriocins (narrow-spectrum antibiotics) produced by these isolates suggest that nontransitive interactions may be important in maintaining diversity even at small spatial scales. The researchers will further characterize these antibiotics, and will use these bacterial isolates to rigorously test theoretical models of ecological dynamics. In addition, they will examine whether interactions among bacteria within an insect host have consequences for the insect and other species in the community. Finally, they will experimentally test theory explaining why bacteria resistant to these antibiotics do not come to predominate in the environment.<br/><br/>This work will increase our knowledge of an agriculturally, and potentially pharmaceutically, important system. Moreover, this work will test the assumptions and predictions of theory that can be applied generally to other systems.

This trend is disturbing because overweight children tend to become overweight or obese adults with potentially life threatening chronic conditions. By focusing on children?s physical activity, we can shift the problem from treatment to prevention. There are numerous academic and commercial applications that aim to help individuals monitor and make proactive decisions about their physical activity; however they do not integrate well into an individual's daily life because they may require manual activity input, asynchronous visualization, and non-instinctive awareness of the application for actionable feedback. Thus, while existing devices have had some success in monitoring, inferring, and presenting activity, they do not always convey the value of physical activity in an intuitive visual abstraction. The feedback design is important in designing wearable technology for children because children are less likely to connect quantifiable measurements - in this case with their health.<br/><br/>In response to these issues, we design innovative wearable computing components that empower children to craft their own intuitive abstractions of wellness data for physical activity promotion. This project builds on existing socio-technical research in health informatics by extending the nascent research subarea, wellness informatics, that studies how technology can be utilized to empower lay populations to stay well and adopt preventative health behaviors. The research objectives of this project are to: (1) Design plug-and-play wellness monitoring Health Sense systems; (2) Design a graphical programming environment to control the actions of the Health Sense systems; and (3) Understand how children use Health Sense systems. The research methodology is inspired by participatory design activities including participant observations, design workshops, and iterative evaluation of prototypes. Overall, the proposed system provides innovations in computing by creating new, wearable computing prototypes and paradigms of interaction. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of Health Sense include undergraduate and graduate research assistant interdisciplinary research training.

There are two types of singular structures to be studied here: vortices (i.e., zeros of complex-valued order parameters) and phase boundaries (i.e., nodal sets of real-valued order parameters). Much of the work concerns the setting where the physical model--Ginzburg-Landau, Gross-Pitaevskii, Allen-Cahn, or Kawasaki-Ohta--is considered on a curved surface. The general goal is to further our understanding of what role curvature plays in the stabilization or destabilization of vortices and phase boundaries. The principal investigator plans to attack these problems through a combination of techniques including gamma-convergence, renormalized energy methods, second-variation arguments, constrained minimization, and parabolic nonlinear partial differential equations methods.<br/><br/>The investigations to be pursued in this project arise from mathematical models for superconductors and superfluids, grain boundaries in alloys, and di-block copolymers. The main thrust of the research is to gain a better understanding of how curvature may play a role in affecting the behavior of these physical systems. For example, in recent years physicists have succeeded in producing superconductors in the shape of spherical shells, rather than just being flat, but at this point there is little theoretical work devoted to understanding how this shape may affect the response of the superconductor to an applied magnetic field. There may be hidden benefits or surprising behavior induced by the curvature of the superconducting surface that can be revealed through a careful mathematical analysis of the underlying models. The principal investigator will carry out much of this research in collaboration with Ph.D. students who will gain valuable experience studying these applications of mathematics as part of their dissertation work."

This research will use techniques from molecular biology, analytical chemistry, genetics and physiology to evaluate the impact of environmental temperature on cell membranes, and of environmental toxicity (e.g., ethanol) on the activities of three enzymes in the ethanol detoxification pathway. Specifically, the research aims to test the prediction that variable temperature environments favor the evolution of cell membrane remodeling, and that efficient detoxification of ethanol depends on interactions between the three enzymes in this pathway. These data will then be used to construct new evolutionary models that help predict the responses of organisms to changing environments.<br/><br/>This project will provide opportunities for undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in the sciences to participate in the research.

Why is this form of reproduction so common? Cloning, which only requires a single individual, is far more efficient. Evolutionary biologists have struggled with this paradox for 40 years. The Red Queen Hypothesis argues that outcrossing is maintained because it promotes the production of genetically diverse offspring that can escape parasitism. In contrast, cloned offspring are genetically identical to their parents and thus may be attacked by parasites that have adapted to infect their ancestors. The proposal will definitively test this hypothesis using a natural population of freshwater snails and their sterilizing parasites. The research will combine long-term field observations and experimental manipulations to determine if outcrossing snails gain an advantage over clonal snails in the presence of parasites. The results will provide one of the most extensive evaluations of selection on reproductive mode and genetic diversity in nature. <br/><br/>Broadly, the project aims to understand the power of genetic diversity to maintain parasite resistance in host populations. These findings will bear upon the work of researchers using applied disease systems to address human and animal health, crop management, and conservation. They will particularly benefit the management of populations in which diversity is declining (conservation) or manipulated (agriculture). Moreover, the investigators are committed to undergraduate education. They propose to translate their work into an interactive laboratory exercise in which to instruct undergraduates in the evolution of interactions between hosts and their parasites."

The goal of this research is to develop a predictive framework for examining how tree species and their associated soil microbes influence C and nutrient cycles in central hardwood forests. Much of what is known about the role of tree species in influencing C and nutrient cycling is based on measurements of processes occurring in the forest canopy, despite the fact that roots and other belowground processes play a vital role in storing C and releasing nutrients. This project will integrate observational and experimental plot-level data with models and satellite imagery to examine how trees with different symbiotic fungal associations influence C and nutrient dynamics. To determine the importance of belowground processes to C and nutrient cycling, trees will be experimentally girdled, a process which physically blocks the flow of sugars to roots. A predictive framework for scaling plot-level data of C-nutrient cycling to ecosystem, regional and global scales will be developed by updating a nutrient uptake model and developing a land cover classification from remotely sensed data. Collectively, these approaches will enable the incorporation of plant-soil interactions into C cycle-climate models, and result in novel insights into how shifts in forest composition may influence ecosystem functioning.<br/><br/>This multidisciplinary project will provide integrative training of undergraduate and graduate students in ecology, ecosystem modeling, and remote sensing. Moreover, the results of this research will be disseminated through reports developed for public land managers (state and federal forests). Reports designed for private landowners will also be produced to disseminate this information. Knowledge about C and nutrient dynamics in forests containing different tree species will enable private landowners, state extension offices and NGOs to make management decisions that enhance ecosystem services such as C storage. Importantly, this knowledge will enable the incorporation of critical plant-soil interactions into regional scale models of C cycling, and address a critical knowledge gap in the ability of policy makers to predict climate change impacts."

This method has produced what is arguably the highest resolution image produced from the TA to date. It accomplishes this with a technology derived from the seismic reflection method, which is the primary technology used in oil and gas exploration. The project will use this technology to address three main scientific questions. (1) What is the geometry of the Farallon Plate that North America has been overriding for at least 100 million years? (2) Are dipping interfaces in the upper mantle we have imaged in previous work markers of mantle flow processes? (3) What do these high resolution images tell us about the nature of the region of Earth?s mantle called the transition zone that lies between two global discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660 km? The project will address these questions through four approaches. (1) 3D visualization using tools commonly available for interpretation seismic reflection data in the oil and gas industry. (2) Application of forward modeling methods to appraise the reliability of our imaging results and to test more detailed hypotheses that will arise form approach (1). (3) Comparison of our results with different approaches produced by other scientists. (4) Further technical developments of the imaging technology that will be applied in the project.<br/><br/>Broader significance and importance<br/>The USArray element of Earthscope was built to provide the data to provide a new understanding of the processes that have shaped the North American continent. Seismic imaging technologies were the main approach to addressing this large issue. This project is important for providing the highest resolution images yet obtained with these data and relating them in true geometry to related work by others. This has the potential to dramatically change our perspectives on many elements of North American geology by being able to see what was previously not possible. This has broad impacts for the oil and gas industry as fundamental work that can impact understanding of geologic processes that shape North American geology. We also plan to produce a number of data products that can be used for science education at all levels."

India is currently experiencing urbanization and the rise of professional opportunities for women that may alter IYCF practices, which heretofore have included extensive breastfeeding, and these in turn may have important impacts on infant growth and health. This project will investigate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and their relationship with maternal work in urban and rural India. To examine the trade-offs between IYCF practices and maternal economic activities, this study will employ a bio-cultural approach and a life history framework. <br/><br/>This 12-month longitudinal study will examine the relationship between maternal work and the duration of exclusive breastfeeding, the quality and timing of the introduction of complementary foods, and ultimately how these are related to infant growth parameters and health. Furthermore, this study will also include ethnographic information on cultural norms and beliefs regarding IYCF practices, as well as allo-maternal care in a rapidly industrializing country and the relationship to IYCF practices. Examining maternal economic activities and IYCF practices allow for a better understanding of how to quantify the costs and benefits of different feeding strategies to both infants/children (in terms of growth and health) and mothers (in terms of economic and social gains or deficits) and how these vary based on household composition and the different employment opportunities that are available to women in the urban and rural samples.<br/><br/>The data obtained from this study will be important in the context of policy discussions of the constraints imposed by the transition to the urban workforce on time available for breastfeeding and maternity leaves that are shorter than the current breastfeeding recommendations.

Since caring for individuals in assisted living and long-term care facilities costs nearly twice what it costs to care for their non-institutionalized counterparts, technologies that support aging in place are seen as one way to address this pressing problem. Among older adults, the groups at the highest risk for extensive care and services are individuals from rural areas, and underprivileged urban areas. Of these two sub-populations, rural individuals make up one fifth of the elderly population and are at highest-risk for requiring long-term care services and support. Similarly, urban-dwelling older adults in low-SES neighborhoods often experience higher rates of functional loss, and poorer overall health outcomes. In addition to stressing the long-term care resources of Medicare, these high-need older adults often require support from informal caregivers. Informal caregivers provide service that would otherwise cost the Medicare system $375 billion dollars a year. The average caregiver is employed, has children, and sixty-six percent of all informal caregivers in the U.S. are women. These caregivers are often called the ""sandwich generation"" because, in addition to traditional family and work roles, they must also provide care to an older adult relative. Thus, there is a huge need to ease the burden on these caregivers so that they can continue to provide the care required to keep older family members out of assisted living.<br/><br/>This project will provide guidance to community members, service providers, and governmental agencies about how to wield technology to enable low-SES, urban- and rural-dwelling older adults to age in place, while simultaneously easing the burden on caregivers. Specifically, the project will perform a needs analysis of these two groups, with an eye to how they are similar to and different from the higher-SES older adults for whom aging in place technologies have already been designed. The project will develop design guidelines to assist designers in targeting this high-need population, taking into account attributes such as proximity of caregivers, access to transportation, access to health services, technology infrastructure and attitudes towards technology. The project will then utilize these guidelines to customize a suite of existing technologies for the specific needs of these two populations. The technologies will be deployed in the homes of older adults in rural and urban settings so that the project can assess how older adults use such technologies and how well these technologies support their ability to age in place. The results will show how pioneering technologies developed in other contexts may be customized for use by low SES, urban- and rural-dwelling older adults. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project include outreach to underserved communities, training of undergraduate and graduate students, broad dissemination of research results beyond traditional disciplinary silos, and building strong connections between academia, private companies, and government agencies, all of whom share the goal of enhancing the quality of life for underserved older adults. Finally, the broader impact in terms of benefits to society is inherent in the research; the project seeks to discover innovative ways of providing more appealing, less invasive, less costly options for caregivers and private and public payers, while simultaneously serving the underserved."

A cline in the snail's life history (LH) traits has also been found where shallow-water snails mature at a smaller size than deep-water snails. This project will determine whether the difference in parasite frequency is positively correlated with the frequency of cross-fertilization and with differences in LH traits for snail populations in 20 lakes on the South Island of New Zealand. The PIs will determine reproductive mode, parasite prevalence, and whether resistance to infection can evolve in cross-fertilizing individuals using laboratory experiments. <br/><br/>The P. antipodarum study system is well suited to test important evolutionary theories using field data, providing information on the extent to which parasitism shapes a host population.

With the ability to completely characterize the genomes of closely related species and individuals within species, it is now possible to elucidate the mechanisms by which evolution proceeds at the molecular level, via both the promotion of adaptations within species and the establishment of new species. This project involves a comparative survey of the genome sequences of the complete set of cryptic species of the Paramecium aurelia assemblage of ciliated protozoans. Just prior to the radiation of this complex, the common ancestor experienced a complete doubling of the nuclear genome, and preliminary evidence suggests that silencing of alternative redundant gene copies in sister lineages has led to map changes that may operate as effective reproductive isolating barriers. The relatively young age of the complex, combined with its large number of constituent species and relatively simple genomic architecture, provides a powerful and unprecedented resource for understanding the roles that gene duplication plays in the generation of biodiversity. By establishing the complete history of all ancestral gene copies over a finely dissected phylogeny, the patterns of preservation vs. demise of various functional classes of duplicate genes will be evaluated. The analyses will also reveal the temporal patterns of gene loss that eventually lead to the acquisition of new equilibrium genomic states in the descendant taxa, as well as clarify the extent to which gene resurrections occur. With the inclusion of information on gene expression, several key hypotheses on the evolution of duplicate genes will be tested. Lending an exceptional level of power to the analyses is the availability of information on the rate and complete molecular spectrum of mutations for two aurelia species. This provides a formal basis for deciphering the forces of evolution operating on duplicate genes by providing a null model for the fates of genes in the absence of selection (e.g., positive selection for preservation or active promotion of gene loss by mutational degradation). As the first study of this sort in a natural assemblage of unicellular eukaryotes, this project has the potential to greatly expand our understanding the mechanisms of genome evolution, providing a complement to the much richer set of observations on multicellular species. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The data generated by this study will serve as a critical and permanent resource for the Paramecium genetics community, while also providing the first detailed data on the dynamics of duplicate genes on an evolutionarily interpretable time scale.

In addition, the database will be integrated into a community-level effort at incorporating ciliates in classroom research. Finally, the project will support the training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, with a goal of establishing them as leaders in the re-emerging field of Paramecium evolutionary genetics."

A popular explanation is that loss of biodiversity, and particularly of species that are resistant to disease, encourages disease epidemics. Thus, enhancement and preservation of species diversity might reduce disease and associated negative effects on host populations. This project combines new mathematical models with experiments to challenge this explanation in a food web/community context, using Daphnia (an aquatic invertebrate) and a fungal pathogen, to explore how the dilution effect of multiple pathogen hosts plays itself out in the face of ecological (interspecific competition) and evolutionary dynamics. The PI's propose that key traits determining transmission also affect interactions with other community members, exploitative competitors and their shared prey in this case, which may alter the details of host-pathogen dynamics, particularly the dilution effect. Models and experiments together will determine whether competition among hosts also influences the spread of disease, whether nutritional value of the food for which hosts compete influences susceptibility to disease, and whether rapid adaptation of hosts to disease can counteract the loss of biodiversity, potentially reducing disease outbreaks. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will tackle these issues using common freshwater organisms that are infected by a virulent pathogen. The Daphnia-fungus system is ideal for asking elegant theoretical questions, and the proposed ambitious experiments will generate empirical data to test the theory.<br/><br/>This multi-disciplinary project will produce new insights into a provocative option for disease control. This project will also enhance training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers, with particular focus on members of underrepresented groups and undergraduates working with mathematics and biology.

Though French and the Picard language both developed from Latin, the political and linguistic unification of France has led to a decline in the use of Picard. Today, Picard is classified as ""severely endangered"" by UNESCO, and considerable uncertainty has been expressed regarding its independence as a separate language. At worst, it is labeled a corrupted dialect of French, but recent linguistic analyses have revealed both important structural differences and complexities in Picard.<br/><br/>This project aims to expand that body of evidence with respect to nasality. Though the two languages share identical inventories of nasal and oral vowels, they are reported to display opposite patterns of regressive nasalization, i.e., where nasal airflow overlaps with a vowel before nasal consonants. Several phonetic studies have shown that this applies to high vowels /i, y, u/ in French, which have no nasal counterpart in either language. However, there is disagreement about whether this occurs at significant rates, and whether it is part of the phonological grammar of French or a minor phonetic reflex. Meanwhile, a major reference grammar of Picard reports that this process applies only to /a, e, o/, which do have nasal counterparts in both languages. However, in contrast with the French studies, there are no phonetic data for Picard to support these claims. Given the possibility that the French government might adopt policies that aim to increase its recognition and support for its regional languages and the general lack of empirical evidence concerning the languages that are most closely related to French, the proposed research is both urgent and extremely timely.<br/><br/>Nasal acoustic energy will be measured to document which vowels undergo nasalization, and to what extent, in Picard, Standard French, and the regional French of Picardie. This project will offer not only a phonological analysis of an understudied language, but also a comparative analysis of two closely related languages. In addition, this study may reveal insights concerning structural relations among nasal vowels. By determining major phonological differences from low-level phonetic phenomena, this study will contribute objective criteria by which a full-fledged language may be distinguished from a dialect, and its methodology is easily adapted to any setting where similar work is needed."

Despite the current attempts to reduce frequency and complexity of alerts, the effectiveness of such alerts remains extremely low, with up to 96% of warnings being ignored by physicians on a daily basis. The primary cause for this is alert fatigue, a state in which physicians, bombarded by numerous warnings, become desensitized. The goal of this project is to transform drug safety alerts from oft-ignored warnings to trusted tools that advise physicians in daily decision making. To accomplish this, the investigators are aiming beyond incremental improvement establishing novel principles for alert design that are based on what physicians consider important when taking advice from peers in their daily clinical work. The project is addressing this problem with a three prong approach: (1) determining principles that accompany trusted physician-to-physician advice regarding appropriate medication prescribing; formative studies will be conducted in a variety of clinical settings to identify key factors in sharing trusted advice among doctors and residents; (2) generating novel designs for drug safety guidance that elicit physician trust and maximize compliance and (3) evaluating the impact of novel designs on physician compliance to DDI warnings.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>By investigating the question of why physicians trust each other, the project is leveraging a fundamental behavioral dynamics reconsidering the role of clinical alerts, and thus generating new principles to design effective computerized guidance that elicits similar notions of trust. A very important contribution of this research is a more complete understanding of what makes physician-to-physician advice trustworthy in the ecosystem of daily clinical activities provides a solid, long-term intellectual basis for the creation of substantially better alerts for a broad variety of CPOE systems. Key innovative aspect of this work is the departure from the mere optimization of alerts to focus rather on complex yet crucial dynamics by which trusted advice is shared among physicians. There are potentially transformative aspects of the proposed work, which if successful, could unleash a new generation of drug-drug interaction warnings that will substantially advance the level of adherence in daily medication prescribing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The outcomes from this project will potentially affect the over 600,000 physicians in the United States who spend the majority of their time in direct patient care, and who are exposed to dozens of DDI alerts on a daily basis. By reframing current alerting strategies, the project results are expected to substantially increase safe drug prescription in day-to-day clinical setting. The investigators are disseminating the project results through large-scale real-world CPOE deployments and live experimental evaluations available to hundreds of physicians.

This research aims, in the long term, to provide programmers with the same computing power that Nature exploits to seemingly solve difficult problems efficiently. The dominant programming model in Nature is that of a massive number of ""cheap"" computing elements collaborating by message passing. One such strategy to solving complex problems is to speculatively pursue many possible solutions in parallel, discarding (partial) computations that lack promise or violate necessary constraints. Unfortunately concurrent speculative algorithms are challenging to develop because of the intermingling of execution paths with concurrency and communication. The goal of this project is to take significant steps towards a theory of speculation for concurrent algorithms and to develop an experimental framework for their development. This research will enable the study of novel applications to utilize the vast computational resources that future processors seem destined to provide.<br/><br/>This project is inspired and informed by recent work on reversible computing which is itself inspired by reversibility in the laws of Physics. Research on reversible concurrency, while illuminating key properties that a system must satisfy (e.g. causal unwinding of communication), has neither yielded models that can reasonably be implemented in a distributed environment nor provided necessary details for a practical language. This project will develop concurrent programming languages that support explicit speculation in concurrent systems using the ideas from reversible concurrent programming to factor out the mechanisms used to realize speculation from speculative algorithms. The project will also leverage ideas from backtracking monad and monad transformers to isolate the interactions between speculation and computation effects including communication, and ideas from process algebras to develop a model for understanding language constructs supporting speculative execution. The research includes experimental work to implement and test linguistic constructs and theoretical work to provide both formal models for these constructs, and algebraic tools to enable reasoning about programs that utilize them."

The human brain, for example, has an amazing capacity to functionally recover from strokes that caused damages to local neuronal circuitries. Despite their scientific and social values, little is known about the principles of such highly adaptive systems. However, recent advances in imaging and computational technologies are practically ripe for visualizing and processing the small insect brain in its entirety, down to the level of individual synaptic connectivity. The objective of this project is the image-based computational modeling of how synaptic connectivity is established in vivo during brain development, a major question in neuroscience today. Using imagery acquired with state-of-the-art imaging techniques (Brainbow and MARCM) at two Drosophila neuroscience laboratories, the goal is to estimate and pattern the complete morphology, connectivity properties and structure dynamics of single neurons and neuronal circuits in the Drosophila larvae. This research effort aims at setting the principle for large-scale studies of more complex brains at single-cell resolution, and modeling adaptive responses of neuronal circuits to changes such as aging, disease and injury. <br/><br/>The overreaching hypothesis of this research is that the brain is a highly adaptive system defined by specific structure and dynamics, as a whole and at the single cell level. Although this is a fundamental hypothesis, it has been difficult to test using live animals, quantitatively through numerical modeling, or even qualitatively through observation. By bringing together leading-edge imaging technologies and computationally intensive image analytics, this project initiates the pursuit of what makes the brain function as a whole throughout life and continuously adapt to various changes such as aging, disease, drug treatment, and injury.

The interface between hydrothermal fluids and the overlying cool and well-oxygenated seawater is characterized by intense thermodynamic disequilibrium, driving a suite of biogeochemical reactions, which in turn further shape ocean chemistry. These reactions generate strong geochemical redox gradients transitioning from the marine water column into the sediments beneath along the interface with reducing hydrothermal fluids. These gradients provide a framework where microbial communities live, evolve, shape, and are shaped by their local geochemical environment. However, the link between the metabolic activity of these micron-sized microorganisms and the resulting geochemical signatures (typically sampled at approximately cm-scale resolution) remains elusive, in large part because of the difficulty of extracting sufficient material for geochemical analyses at small scales (~1-100 microns). Yet, it is precisely this fine-scale geochemical variability that directly impacts biogeochemical activity. This research takes advantage of recent advances in analytical techniques that allow for geochemical and stable isotopic measurements at a spatial resolution as small as ~1-10 microns. Samples come from accessible shallow-sea hydrothermal systems in the Mediterranean Sea, where diverse sulfur cycling has been previously identified and steep redox gradients make it possible for micron-scale measurements to sample across a wide range of geochemical environments. In addition, a 20+-year record of observations allows the results to be put into a rich geochemical context. Goals are to generate an unparalleled high-resolution geochemical and isotopic characterization of sulfur cycling in shallow-sea hydrothermal systems and use the resulting data to calculate the thermodynamic drivers for diverse biogeochemical reactions. The data will also allow the evaluation of the role of ambient geochemistry on isotopic fractionation during sulfur biogeochemical cycling and application of results to understanding variations in the isotopic composition of sulfur species in marine sediments through time because sulfur isotopes are one of the principle means to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions over Earth history. Broader impacts of the work include undergraduate and graduate student training in the field and laboratory. Cross training in different laboratories will also deepen the integration of research and education. This project also involves international collaboration with Sicilian and German scientists."

During a doctoral program, students are acculturated to the norms of the discipline, learning scholarly practices and behaviors that guide them for a lifetime. Advisors, as guides to these scholarly journeymen, serve as critical gatekeepers to the discipline and can have a profound influence on their doctoral students. Doctoral students comprise a larger portion of the academic workforce, yet scholars have very little knowledge of their place in scholarly networks, the degree to which they contribute to scholarly output, and the impact of this output. Very little quantitative analysis shows the relationship between advisors' scholarly practices and the future success of their advisees. This study investigates these issues from two main angles: understanding the contribution of doctoral students to social-science research (the extent and character of this contribution) and the impact of this research (visibility through citations); and examining the advisor's knowledge base and knowledge-diffusion practices, and whether these factors are involved in expanding knowledge frontiers and how they relate to the career trajectories and future success of doctoral students. This approach allows quantification of advisor behaviors and documentation of patterns within advisee behaviors. This research thus produces a viable framework for predicting advisee success based on advisor qualities and individual students' publication practices in the course of their doctoral studies. This predictive model can then be used by science policy makers and administrators for more efficient allocation of resources and to identify ways to promote innovation in higher education. This work supports a quantitative-based understanding of contribution of doctoral students to the creation of knowledge and of the relationship between the scholarly practices of advisors and the productivity and impact of their proteges. Such a model will also enhance our understanding of how the different scientific practices of the advisors -- including their embeddedness in particular disciplines, degree of mobility among different disciplines, and involvement in highly collaborative interdisciplinary work -- will have an effect on the career trajectories and scientific success of their advisees. The combination of multiple datasets and the innovative analyses in this first research study on proteges provides a rich foundation for the development of new metrics and evaluations of knowledge diffusion, scholarly productivity, and scientific impact in doctoral education.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Educational opportunities are provided through the funding of students and the integration of this project into the classroom. In addition, this research provides a platform for future analyses on the interaction of mentoring in doctoral education with individual protege characteristics.

By exploiting the morphological stereotypes and unparalleled single-cell resolution of Drosophila motor neurons, this project will yield the first motor neuron map in the Drosophila CNS, serving as a case study and a step towards modeling the entire brain. The first complete map of a whole brain is that of C. elegans. Its virtue, unchallenged thus far, is resolution down to the level of single visually identified neurons. Because the connectivity of individual neurons ultimately determines brain function, the creation of neural maps at this level in other more complex model organisms is critical for advancing our understanding of brain development. The immediate goal of this project is to create a neural map of a defined population of motor neurons in a healthy Drosophila brain at the single-neuron level. It is intended to be a resource for anyone who wants to ""navigate"" a model brain in vivo. To achieve this goal, this project includes the following tasks. (a) Modeling the individual neuron morphology with automated image-based motor neuron classification. To meet this objective, a new framework will be developed for three-dimensional partitioning of the neurons? morphological compartments, namely soma (cell body), axon and dendrites. (b) Classifying the neuron morphology from the partitioned volumes. The approach consists of a novel possibilistic semi-supervised clustering framework, robust enough to discriminate between different neuron morphologies, and to handle the intra-class variability and inter-class similarities.

Presently, the research value of this task has been heightened by the increased availability of massive network data in the domains of life and social sciences. However, existing algorithms for subgraph mining suffer from various limitations; noteworthy among these are lack of scalability, lack of user interaction and the absence of a mechanism to mine dynamic graphs. This research aims to overcome the above limitations by accomplishing the following three related tasks: (1) use of Monte Carlo sampling mechanisms for designing scalable graph mining algorithms; (2) develop real-time interactive graph mining systems using subgraph sampling approaches; and (3) discover models for graph evolution that are based on sampling and driven by the principles of game theory and economics.<br/><br/>This research builds a novel paradigm for subgraph mining that is based on Monte Carlo sampling. This allows the development of algorithms that are scalable, by avoiding the need to enumerate all subgraph patterns. The resulting algorithms will be applied to subgraph mining problems in systems biology, e.g., predicting disease pathways by mining graphs from genomics and proteomics co-expression networks. A second outcome of this research is an interactive pattern mining framework using subgraph sampling where user feedback guides updates of the sampling distribution such that subsequent sampling prioritizes patterns that are considered ""interesting"" to the user. A third outcome is a subgraph sampling method that uses a game theoretic mechanism to design a subgraph evolution model for prediction tasks (such as link prediction) in dynamic networks. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Availability of tools for mining large graphs enables the opportunity to build network biomarkers, which are novel signatures for disease diagnosis and risk factor analysis. A sampling based interactive pattern system is instrumental to mine ""interesting"" associations between diseases and medicines from numerous hidden datasets that are currently unexplored in many hospitals and health clinics. Scalable graph mining algorithms are also likely to find use in search, e-commerce and social networks based industry. The educational goal of this research is to leverage the PI's industrial experience to develop a ""Large-scale data analysis"" course on methods needed to build data mining systems that work on industry-scale data.<br/><br/>Additional information about the project, including the findings, methods, open source implementations of algorithms, publications and data can be accessed through the project website at http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~alhasan/graph_mining."

These deposits are thin layers that are found in igneous rocks and are characterized by the presence of 1 to 5 volume percent of disseminated sulfide minerals, principally those rich in iron, copper and nickel. PGE (platinum?group element) sulfide minerals occur in much smaller concentrations but provide the economically important metals such as platinum, and also palladium. Our need for platinum-group elements is projected to increase in coming years, driven particularly by advances in the automotive industry. The largest reserves of platinum are found in South Africa and Zimbabwe, with deposits found in the Bushveld Complex and the Great Dyke. Large reserves are also found in Russia (Siberia) associated with a somewhat different assemblage of igneous rocks that are very rich in sulfide minerals (sometimes nearly 100 % sulfides). The igneous rocks of the Stillwater Complex in Montana host the only two PGE mines in the United States in what is called the J-M Reef. The palladium production from the mines accounts for a few percent of the world total. Because of our utilization of PGEs the United States needs to increase our reserves and reduce our dependence on foreign sources. Research of the type described in this proposal is needed to improve models for both exploration and development of reef-type PGE deposits, similar to those found in the Stillwater Complex.<br/><br/>The importance of sulfur derived from sedimentary rocks of the earth?s crust has not been previously emphasized in models dealing with the generation of reef-type deposits, largely because sulfur isotopic values are near those typically assigned to sulfur derived from the earth?s mantle. Because country rocks to the Stillwater Complex are in excess of 2.6 billion years (referred to as Archean age), the utilization of isotopic ratios that involve both 33S and 34S values provides another method to test if country rock derived sulfur has been essential for the production of PGE-enriched magmas. Sulfur from Archean sedimentary rocks may show a distinct departure from a slope of ~ 0.515 in ratio plots involving 33S and 34S; the relation defines what is known as the Terrestrial Fractionation Line (TFL). The origin of the anomalous departure from the TFL is still a matter of debate, but the presence of anomalous sulfur isotopic values in igneous rocks confirms the assimilation, or incorporation, of Archean-aged sulfur of country rock origin. In order to test the hypothesis that crustal sulfur derived from Archean country rocks was involved in the formation of the J-M Reef and other sulfide-rich zones in the Stillwater Complex we propose to collect multiple sulfur isotope data from samples collected in traverses through the Stillwater Complex in two locations that include the current workings at the Stillwater and East Boulder mines. Recent mapping in the Stillwater Mine has clearly defined a number of sulfide-rich lenses that constitute the PGE mineralization in the J-M Reef. Our sampling will include the individual lenses, with detailed petrographic (microscopic) analyses done to interpret interfaces between mineralized and non-mineralized domains. Sulfur concentrations from all samples will also be collected; the combined data set will permit rigorous mass balance calculations that will be used to quantify the importance of crustal sulfur involvement in the Stillwater Complex. The proposed work is required to evaluate if large PGE deposits owe their origins to the interaction of magmas with sedimentary country rocks that supplied sulfur far in excess of that which could have been sequestered from the mantle source of the magmas. Our results will constrain models for further PGE exploration and shed light on the processes of magma-country rock interaction that may be of significance in the generation of several types of metallic ore deposits."

As a result the viability and reproductive success of plant populations depends upon the composition of the soil community and the long-term trajectory of terrestrial plant productivity and community composition depends upon the dynamics within the soil microbial community. Experimental manipulations have demonstrated that the soil microbial community changes with its local plant host and often this change leads to a decline in performance of that host. In agricultural crops, for example, the change in microbial community following mono-cropping leads to a yield decline, thereby motivating a strategy of crop rotation. Recent experimental work suggests that these same dynamics can contribute to the replacement of plant species and the maintenance of diversity in unmanaged plant communities. While there is strong evidence for these processes, this work has not been integrated into a comprehensive understanding of the long-term potential for microbial dynamics to drive plant community patterns. The goal of this research project is to synthesize the evidence on the ecology of plant-microbe interactions within a monograph. The monograph will build from the determinants of virulence in plant pathogens and of stability of benefits from plant mutualists toward a framework that predicts microbial mediation of plant dynamics. This framework will allow predictions of changes of plant community composition across time, and across environmental perturbations. <br/><br/>This project will produce a monograph that will serve as a comprehensive synthesis of a growing area of plant ecology and will thereby be useful for undergraduate and graduate training. The monograph will motivate further work on the plant-microbe interactions and their consequences, and the framework developed will facilitate prediction of responses of terrestrial communities to anthropogenic disturbance, such as climate change."

The dynamic transitions of such dissipative systems are then classified as continuous, catastrophic or random. The project involves specific collaborations with active atmosphere/ocean scientists in different institutions. Graduate students will be involved in the project as well.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI and his collaborators will work on mathematical models for large scale climate phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO), with the goal of understanding their long term variability. A recently developed dynamic transition theory will be employed for this purpose. The approach allows one to look at the full set of transition states, e.g. the onset of an El Nino or a La Nina episode. By identifying such transition states and classifying them both mathematically and physically, possible physical mechanisms for such phenomena can be identified or perhaps ruled out. The proposed research involves specific collaborations with active atmosphere/ocean scientists in different institutions, and it is expected that the proposed studies will lead to improved predictions and new insights of weather, climate, and environmental phenomena of central importance to our economy. Also, graduate students are partially involved in the proposed project."

Two classes of problems will be investigated. The first one is that of the boundary conditions for limited area weather models for which physical models do not provide natural boundary conditions. This problem is as old as numerical weather prediction itself, and it is expected that inappropriate boundary conditions will introduce spurious modes, in particular as improved computing capabilities allow better spatial and temporal resolutions. The aim is to derive boundary conditions that lead to mathematically correct problems, and that are computationally satisfactory in the sense that they let the waves move freely inside and outside the domain of computation. The PI will continue his investigations in this direction. The second class of problems is that of moist convection, precipitations and clouds. Our limited understanding of the physics of clouds is one of the primary causes of uncertainty in the current weather and climate predictions. The difficulties are in part due to the large differences in scales, ranging from cloud sizes of hundreds of kilometers to particles (droplets of water, ice or aerosols) of a few microns. There is a similar range of time scales. The project will study this physical problem using mathematical tools from convex analysis and variational inequalities. Numerical multilevel methods will be used as well to study the interaction of clouds and topography near the equator; and finally the tools of convex analysis will also be used for the very modeling of the changes of phase in the clouds. These studies will be conducted in close collaboration with physicists. The project will involve graduate students and post-doctoral associates who will be trained in this important interdisciplinary area. <br/><br/>This research project will study fundamental problems in the numerical prediction of weather and climate, as well as problems in the mathematical modeling of clouds and evaporation. The project component related to numerical weather prediction addresses the problem of using information from coarse featured global weather data for fine grained local and regional predictions. If the coarse data are not coupled correctly to the regional model that has higher resolution, then spurious systematic errors (e.g. ""ghost"" weather fronts) may arise. The project will investigate the mathematical foundations of this problem. The project component on the modeling of clouds and evaporation will use advanced mathematical tools to contribute to the understanding of a set of basic open problems in weather and climate research: Do clouds help cool the planet (because they reflect sunlight) or do they contribute to warming (because they can hold thermal energy)? Weather prediction and climate modeling are objectives with important human, social and economic interest. The project will also train young scientists at the interface of mathematics, geophysical fluid mechanics, and scientific computing."

The associated flooding can be catastrophic for people living along rivers, but hazard mitigation is difficult because models cannot predict the timing, location, or style of river avulsion. Incisional avulsion occurs when a new river channel is established through erosion rather than deposition, and, although it is common in some river systems, this avulsion style is particularly poorly understood. The goal of this study is to define the sedimentologic and hydrodynamic conditions associated with incisional avulsions. Using combined modeling and field approaches the PIs will evaluate how characteristics such as floodplain topography, slope, ground cover, and overbank deposition control avulsion styles and test the hypothesis that incisional avulsions occur in steep fluvial systems with topographically rough, unvegetated, well-drained floodplains that lack abundant overbank suspended-sediment supply. Modeling work will be conducted with Delft3D, a physics-based numerical model that solves the equations for water flow and sediment transport, and field-data collection will focus on ancient strata where channel and floodplain characteristics can be measured for large numbers of paleoavulsion deposits.<br/><br/>The results from this project will help improve prediction of avulsion flood hazards and will enhance understanding of the relationships between channel avulsion and floodplain erosion and deposition. Avulsion is also a primary control on the distribution of fluvial hydrocarbon, groundwater, and CO2-storage reservoirs. Better understanding of avulsion processes gained through this research will aid subsurface predictions of reservoir quality and location. Broader impacts of this work also include development of a self-paced, web-based education module about rivers and avulsions. In collaboration with the Geoscience Outreach Foundation the PIs will design a Rivers from Above curriculum comprising guided tours of rivers and avulsions using Google Earth and Google Maps. Rivers from Above will focus on river forms and patterns, river avulsion, and avulsion impacts on society. The PIs will work with the outreach offices at Penn State and Boston College to develop, pilot test, and evaluate module activities in Pittsburgh- and Boston-area schools, targeting underserved communities in each region.

For example, 90% of the cells in the human body are bacteria. Some microorganisms may be pathogens that cause disease or death of their hosts while others, such as gut bacteria of animals, may be essential for their nutrition and survival. A growing body of literature suggests that a number of symbiotic microorganisms play a defensive role, protecting their hosts against natural enemies such as parasites, pathogens and herbivores. The goal of this project is to review and synthesize the results of past studies to gain new insights into the underlying mechanisms and ecological consequences of defensive symbiosis. Past research leading to this goal has focused on two distinct groups of defensive symbionts: toxic alkaloid-producing fungal symbionts of grasses that make host plants poisonous to grazing animals and bacterial symbionts of ticks that may exclude pathogens or reduce their transmission. These interactions can provide a strong advantage to hosts, leading to an increase in the prevalence of defensive symbiosis. The major product of this project will be a book on defensive symbiosis that synthesizes previous research in relation to broader areas of research in ecology, microbiology and plant and animal health, and that highlights important areas for future research. A second product will be an open-access database from a 13-year experiment manipulating defensive symbiosis in experimental grasslands. <br/><br/>Defensive symbiosis has significant impacts on our economy, the environment and human health. For example, toxin-producing fungal symbionts of grasses are a serious problem for grazing livestock but provide effective biocontrol against pests in turfgrass systems. Likewise, many arthropods host bacterial symbionts that inhibit pathogen infection or transmission, including important human pathogens, such as the dengue fever virus. In humans, altering our normal microbiota can lead to a number of health problems including disease. In sum, key species in many ecosystems are characterized by defensive symbiosis. The resulting book will provide a widely accessible and comprehensive body of past results, improving our understanding of defensive symbiosis and informing future applications of these interactions. The database will provide research opportunities for students and other scientists."

Because humans far exceed the abilities of state-of-the-art robots in vision, creativity, and adaptability, interest is rapidly growing in a human-centered approach to robotics: combining the strengths of humans with the superior precision and repeatability of robots. And yet, our available motion planning tools, while powerful at computing motions for complex autonomous tasks, are poorly suited for human-centered applications that demand responsive and natural motions. This proposal hypothesizes that a new cooperative motion planning paradigm will support major advances in intuitiveness and task performance of human-operated robots such as intelligent vehicles, tele-surgery systems, search and-rescue robots, and household robots. This hypothesis is echoed in an educational plan that aims to train engineers with cross-disciplinary strengths that bridge both the technical and social dimensions of robotics. Initial human subjects studies on novice operators with the PI's cooperative motion planning algorithms suggest that the technique leads to dramatic reductions in task completion time and collision rate in cluttered environments. The proposed work will conduct further investigations along this line of research to 1) identify characteristics of cooperative planners - such as optimality, responsiveness, and completeness - that yield effective human-operator systems, both in terms of objective performance metrics and subjective preferences, 2) to design planners that optimize cooperativity metrics under computational resource and communication constraints, and 3) to enhance the capabilities of such planners to assist operators in complex manipulation tasks.<br/><br/>The planners developed in this research and the rich datasets acquired via user studies will serve as resources to help human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers design safe and socially acceptable robot behaviors. Moreover, advances in cooperative motion planning may have long-term social and economic impact by enabling new applications of robotics in driver assist systems, space exploration, medicine, household robotics, manufacturing, and construction. Research is integrated with education in a range of activities that include CS curriculum development, development of a new graduate course on optimization and machine learning, and in new software libraries for robotics education. New modules on motion planning, behavior recognition, and HRI will be incorporated in AI and robotics courses. An REU is requested for each summer of the grant and will be recruited from a minority-serving institution in cooperation with the Alliance for the Advancement of African-American Researchers in Computing (A4RC). One or more IU undergraduates will be involved in research and mentored according to the Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC) program, with preference given to minority and women students."

These problems are challenging because they require searching high-dimensional state spaces with complex geometric constraints, nonlinear dynamics, often with contact and impact, and long time horizons. Prior approaches have sought to solve these problems efficiently by embedding a great deal of domain knowledge into planning, but have relied heavily on human expertise to develop and exploit this knowledge. This process is tedious, error-prone, and does not scale well to harder problems that do not possess an obvious structure. This project will investigate automated strategies for planning systems to automatically discover common solution structures from past experience and to reuse this knowledge in new problems, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating a system that automatically optimizes planning strategies for a novel domain with minimal training and hand tuning.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The ability to solve large planning problems efficiently has myriad benefits to many fields of knowledge.

At the same time, D. melanogaster evolved a remarkable tolerance of ethanol and acetic acid in its fermenting fruit habitat. The natural history of this fruit fly allows for an investigation of how organisms are likely to respond to a complex and increasingly variable climate. In particular, this research will test hypotheses about how changes in cell membranes and metabolism maintain health, performance and fitness in a thermally-variable and alcohol-rich niche. The experiments investigate changes that occur within the lifespan of organisms to deal with the environment -- plastic physiologies -- and changes that have evolved to fit organisms to their environment via the process of natural selection physiological adaptations. The goal of this research is to identify the interactions among multiple genes that underlie these plastic and adaptive responses to a complex environment.<br/><br/>The proposed research will further our knowledge in areas identified by the Frontiers in Evolutionary Biology workshop (NSF 2005), provide insight on genetic, cellular and physiological mechanisms of environmental tolerance, and develop new methods for associating physiological traits with complex genetic variation at multiple genes.

This trend necessitates a widespread transition from traditional sequential programming to parallel programming. But because parallel programming is notoriously difficult, adoption has been slow. A fundamental reason for this difficulty is that programs can often yield inconsistent answers, or even crash, due to unpredictable interactions between parallel tasks. Certain classes of programs, however, admit strong mathematical guarantees that they will behave the same in spite of parallel execution. This research is extending the mathematical foundation underlying such deterministic programs. It studies a family of programming languages that allow both parallel computations, and communications between them in the form of restricted modifications to, and observations of, shared data. The communication allowed is of a more general nature than previous work in the area.<br/><br/>This project is centered around a variant of the lambda-calculus that includes shared variables whose states occupy a join semilattice and change monotonically within that lattice. A number of deterministic programming models, both recent (Intel CnC), and older (Kahn-MacQueen Process Networks), can be mapped into this framework. In addition to constructing proofs of determinism for the language, this project explores various extensions, including limited forms of nondeterminism (i.e., which admit failures but never wrong answers). Finally this project will use its formal language as a tool for reasoning about practical parallel programs. That is, determinism can be demonstrated by verifying that the program's shared states form a semilattice and state changes are monotonic."

The benefits of such an abstract layer are self-evident, and yet it results in a conceptual model of computing that is unsuitable for reasoning about entire classes of applications including systems that aim to optimize the use of energy or that aim to guarantee privacy and security of information in the presence of arbitrary attackers. More fundamentally, the computational model becomes at odds with the basic laws of physics which hinders the general ability to explore, model, and understand nature's interactions, connections, complex relations, and interdependencies. To remedy these problems, the research builds a model of computation based on the physical principle of ""conservation of information,"" uses it to expose information manipulation, and to reason about information-flow security, privacy, and similar applications.<br/><br/>Technically, the proposed model builds on the type isomorphisms and categorical structures that underlie models of linear logic and quantum computing, and treats information as a linear resource that can neither be erased nor duplicated. On the theoretical side, the model is expected to unveil deeper and more elegant symmetries of computation than have previously been reported. In particular, in a computational model where information is conserved, it is natural to introduce notions of information debts that are related to continuations. Such notions could be useful to addressing long-standing theoretical problems related to the duality of computation. With an eye towards applications, and hence with the aim of reasoning about open systems which may erase and duplicate information relative to their environment, the model is extended with a layer based on the concept of arrows that allows explicit erasure and duplication of information in a way that is tracked by the type system. By implementing this extended model in a mainstream programming environment, it will become possible to reason about new classes of applications that deal with information manipulation in a systematic manner using the established tools of programming language theory."

While these languages enable stream-processing programs (which take the form of flow-graphs of stream operators) to execute automatically and efficiently on multicores and small clusters of machines, they optimize assuming an unchanging streaming workload and cannot handle dynamic conditions found in many realistic streaming situations, such as inside modern networks.<br/><br/>This proposal pursues a more adaptive approach: fast, incremental compilation and recompilation of subgraphs of a stream-processing flow-graph to support dynamic placement and optimization policies while retaining high performance.

One of the fundamental questions facing scientists seeking to understand global biogeochemistry is: What is the relationship between microbial community composition (who¡¦s there?), metabolic activity (what are they doing?), and ambient environmental conditions (e.g., pH, sulfate levels) (how are they impacted?). Sulfur cycling, particularly the coupling between sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation, is one of the dominant geochemical pathways driving carbon mineralization within many diverse microbial ecosystems today. Isotopic and mineralogical evidence recovered from ancient rocks suggest biological sulfate reduction played an important role on early Earth as well. In attempt to better understand this globally important process and the corresponding biosignatures of active sulfur cycling microorganisms, we are proposing a multi-disciplinary, high-resolution geochemical and molecular biological investigation of closely coupled microbial sulfur cycling in three representative microbial ecosystems. These include a 3-4 member synergistic anoxygenic phototrophic consortium, moderately diverse chemosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing mats, and highly complex benthic oxygenic photosynthetic microbial mats. These systems differ in terms of biological complexity and in the major sulfur cycling pathways, that collectively will provide fundamental information regarding light-dependent and -independent sulfur metabolisms. Our work combines analyses at high spatial (?Ým-scale) resolution of sulfur and carbon isotopic data using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and FISH-nanoSIMS, microvoltammetic sulfur species measurements, and CARD-FISH molecular imaging to investigate the linkage among microbial spatial organization, metabolic activity, and establishment of geochemical gradients by coupled sulfur cycling communities. Together, the data from this combined laboratory and field study will develop a new toolset that can be used to study tightly coupled sulfur cycling on an unprecedented scale within microbially dominated sedimentary environments. <br/><br/>This project will inform scientists about the fundamental chemistry and biology governing sulfur in the environment, past and present. This is important because sulfur plays a critical role in processes controlling not only how we view the evolution of life on this planet, but also about ore deposits as sources of metal resources, oil and gas formation and their economic recovery, soil nutrient availability affecting crop yields and the quality of water resources, and the transport of many contaminants in ground and surface waters.

Microorganisms have been a potentially important part of sulfur cycling for billions of years (Johnston et al., 2005; Mojzsis et al, 2007), yet many of the fundamental interactions between microorganisms and elemental sulfur are not understood. Advancing our understanding of how these systems behave requires delving into the detailed interactions between cells (bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic), minerals (especially nanoparticles), and water chemistry (especially redox speciation).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Elemental sulfur occurs as bulk and nanoparticulate phases and can be utilized by microorganisms for all 3 major catabolic paths through use as an electron acceptor, donor, or essentially both in the case of disproportionation. Dissolved sulfur species also interact with elemental sulfur, and those species can additionally react with metals, most importantly iron. Microorganisms must solubilize elemental sulfur in order to metabolize it, but this mineral is fundamentally different from other minerals where microbe-mineral interactions have been well studied, such as iron oxide minerals (for example Hernandez and Newman, 2001; Childers et al., 2002; Burgon et al., 2003; Lovley, 2008; Newman, 2008). Solubilizing elemental sulfur can be accomplished through interaction with organic ligands or through interactions with other sulfur species to form new soluble intermediates such as polysulfides. Investigator proposes to develop a combined in situ analytical capability to investigate sulfur speciation and elemental sulfur mineralogy in field and laboratory tests to address the following hypothesis: The size and surface character of elemental sulfur is a key component controlling sulfur cycling in biotic and abiotic reactions in many environments.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Advances in fundamental cell-mineral-redox interactions in the sulfur system provide an opportunity to integrate some exciting educational experiences to engage stakeholders and professionals in health, policy, and legal fields with research goals that will yield transformative insights of value to the broad study of sulfur-based microorganisms and element cycling through time and in environmentally relevant systems. Sulfur species and minerals are importantly affected by a number of known organisms, but the level of detail proposed for elemental sulfur particle size/character and redox speciation has never been applied. When comparing the wealth of information that has come from years of investigating detailed iron oxide-microbe interactions (Newman, 2008), a detailed investigation of fundamental microbe-mineral-redox interactions involving sulfur may yield critical new insights. The application of the knowledge gained through these investigations of the sulfur system can be applied to broader thinking about similar cell-mineral-redox interactions that affect problems of human health. This opens an opportunity to advance the training of scientists to communicate results with the non-scientific public, and provide training to the medical professionals, policymakers, and legal professionals that utilize mineralogical, geochemical, and microbial information in addressing problems such as asbestos mineral exposure, groundwater arsenic contamination, and selenium toxicity. A series of classes and professional workshops will be developed, alongside a series of learning modules illustrating fundamental cell-mineral-redox interactions, to engage students and professionals in hands-on experiences of how geochemical, mineralogical, and microbial data is gathered, assessed, evaluated, and debated to arrive at reliable information. The participation of stakeholders in the practice of scientific data collection, evaluation, and debate integrated with the training of scientists with better communication skills represents not only an advance in the preparation of scientists, but an advance also in preparing professionals who will work with those scientists."

Non-model systems can have many biological features that directly hamper genome assembly, and therefore suffer from limited capacity to benefit from genomic tools. This research aims to develop a new approach to genome assembly, one that combines next-generation sequencing with recombinant populations made using genetic crosses between individuals.

These include topics ranging from authentication, authorization, scheduling, virtualization, middleware design, interface design and cybersecurity, to the optimization of grid-enabled and cloud-enabled computational schemes for researchers in astronomy, chemistry, biology, engineering, atmospheric science and epidemiology. The project team will provide a significant new experimental computing grid and cloud test-bed, named FutureGrid, to the research community, together with user support for third-party researchers conducting experiments on FutureGrid.<br/><br/>The test-bed will make it possible for researchers to conduct experiments by submitting an experiment ?plan? that is then executed via a sophisticated workflow engine, preserving the provenance and state information necessary to allow reproducibility. <br/><br/>The test-bed includes a geographically distributed set of heterogeneous computing systems, a data management system that will hold both metadata and a growing library of software images, and a dedicated network allowing isolatable, secure experiments. The test-bed will support virtual machine-based environments, as well as native operating systems for experiments aimed at minimizing overhead and maximizing performance. The project partners will integrate existing open-source software packages to create an easy-to-use software environment that supports the instantiation, execution and recording of grid and cloud computing experiments. <br/><br/>One of the goals of the project is to understand the behavior and utility of cloud computing approaches. Researchers will be able to measure the overhead of cloud technology by requesting linked experiments on both virtual and bare-metal systems. FutureGrid will enable US scientists to develop and test new approaches to parallel, grid and cloud computing, and compare and collaborate with international efforts in this area. The FutureGrid project will provide an experimental platform that accommodates batch, grid and cloud computing, allowing researchers to attack a range of research questions associated with optimizing, integrating and scheduling the different service models. The FutureGrid also provides a test-bed for middleware development and, because of its private network, allows middleware researchers to do controlled experiments under different network conditions and to test approaches to middleware that include direct interaction with the network control layer. Another component of the project is the development of benchmarks appropriate for grid computing, including workflow-based benchmarks derived from applications in astronomy, bioinformatics, seismology and physics.<br/><br/>The FutureGrid will form part of NSF's TeraGrid high-performance cyberinfrastructure. It will increase the capability of the TeraGrid to support innovative computer science research requiring access to lower levels of the grid software stack, the networking software stack, and to virtualization and workflow orchestration tools. Full integration into the TeraGrid is anticipated by 1st October 2011. <br/><br/>Education and broader outreach activities include the dissemination of curricular materials on the use of FutureGrid, pre-packaged FutureGrid virtual machines configured for particular course modules, and educational modules based on virtual appliance networks and social networking technologies that will focus on education in networking, parallel computing, virtualization and distributed computing. The project will advance education and training in distributed computing at academic institutions with less diverse computational resources. It will do this through the development of instructional resources that include preconfigured environments that provide students with sandboxed virtual clusters. These can be used for teaching courses in parallel, cloud, and grid computing. Such resources will also provide academic institutions with a simple opportunity to experiment with cloud technology to see if such technology can enhance their campus resources.

This research aims to understand and interpret the genetics of functional adaptive biodiversity by integrating analyses at multiple levels of functional trait variation (DNA sequence, gene expression, phenotypes) with data on the environmental, ecological, and evolutionary history of an entire clade of species: Solanum section Lycopersicum (the wild tomatoes). The project focuses on two traits critical to plant-environment interactions: leaf ecophysiology (which influences plant responses to water, light, and carbon dioxide), and constitutive and induced defense responses (which influence the interaction between plants and their natural predators). Both traits differ within and among Solanum species, likely as the result of rapid adaptive change. Using 'next generation' sequencing technologies to quantify DNA sequence and gene expression differences among genotypes and environmental conditions, the project has three components: 1) Comparative transcriptomics (i.e., gene expression profiling) which will provide a evolutionary genomics framework for understanding genetic variation in the group, and identify candidate genes for important ecological transitions among species; 2) Experimental transcriptomics of gene expression responses to both benign (unstressed; noninduced) and stressed (drought-stressed; induced defense) conditions, which will identify molecular responses to ecologically-relevant environments, and evaluate the genetic constraints on current and future evolutionary responses critical to organism-environment interactions; and 3) Integration of results from this study with existing data to generate a core set of loci underpinning functional responses to abiotic and biotic environmental variation, and to develop an integrated understanding of natural adaptive trait variation across an entire group of species. <br/><br/>Global environmental change is expected to fundamentally alter patterns of biodiversity, but predicting the direction and magnitude of this change is extremely difficult. This research aims to understand how current biodiversity is shaped by, and reacts to, environmental variation. The sequence and trait data uncovered will contribute to understanding how plants are able to respond to and cope with stress imposed by both their physical environment and by their predators. The project will also contribute to human resources by training researchers in a broad set of skills at the interface of experimental genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics. This research focuses on the wild tomatoes, a diverse group of Andean species within the economically important genus Solanum. Uncovering the genetic basis of diversification is particularly pertinent in the Andean biological hotspot, where the impacts of land-use and climate change threaten a cradle of biodiversity that holds an estimated 12% of global flowering plant diversity. In addition, by examining the wild relatives of several important crop species, including tomato, potato, and pepper, this research has the potential to identify valuable natural variation that confers plant tolerance to critical environmental stresses."

This link between microorganisms and their chemical surroundings shape a wide variety of modern and ancient settings. There remain a host of questions, challenges, and opportunities for advancing better understanding of these interactions. These gaps in understanding limit the ability to precisely define signals of life in deep time or other planets, gauge the relative changes in microbial cycling of elements in response to climate change, and predict how anthropogenic impacts on land, sea, and atmosphere will affect natural systems, among other things.<br/><br/>Microbial interactions with their chemical surroundings are key processes to consider in a wide range of problems of great societal interest, including the availability of resources, the impact of man on natural systems, the fate of contaminants in the environment, and the origin, evolution, and evidence for life.

While widely recognized as a powerful route to compositionally-complex inorganic solids, ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP), which is an aerosol-based synthetic technique that uses ultrasound for nebulization, has been under-realized as a synthetic route to architecturally-diverse particles. This CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program will emphasize precursor design and decomposition behavior, as well as aerosol droplet phase and surface chemistry, to achieve architecturally-diverse particles with USP for photocatalytic applications including water splitting for solar H2 generation. Synthetic targets include i) highly-tailored titania photocatalysts in which porosity, crystal phase distribution, and surface decoration are controlled and ii) visible light driven O2-evolving photocatalysts with high active site dispersion. The former will be achieved by exploiting a newly discovered salt-assisted route to porous particles in which low-melting salt mixtures serve as a pore template and pre-formed titania colloids serve as the building blocks to the larger porous particles. The latter will be achieved by targeting valence band modified transition metal oxides. In this case, architecturally-diverse particles will be achieved with USP by deviating from convention and selecting precursors that yield templates and/or structure-directing agents via i) reaction (e.g., metathesis approaches) or ii) decomposition from single-source precursors. Given that the proposed research addresses such a timely issue, the development of sustainable energy sources, it is also of utmost importance that considerable effort be spent educating the community about it. To this aim, an Energy Ambassadors' Program is proposed in which undergraduates, with guidance from senior laboratory members, return to their high schools to discuss their research through an engaging demonstration.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Substantial resources are being directed toward the development of alternative energy platforms in attempts to minimize the potentially catastrophic effects associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Given that the sun provides the Earth with 120,000 trillion watts (TW) of energy, solar energy conversion represents the most viable means of sustainably producing 13 TW, which is consistent with global human demand. The proposed research aims to develop new materials for harnessing the energy of the sun to split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), with H2 representing a clean fuel that does not emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants upon use. The new materials will be prepared by an aerosol-based synthetic approach, with an emphasis on discovering new ways in which the architecture and shape of the resulting particles can be controlled by producing structure-directing agents using chemical methods. Controlling the shape and architecture of the prepared particles potentially provides a way in which the desirable features of a material can be enhanced selectively, thus maximizing their light harvesting properties and surface reactivity. Given that the proposed research addresses such a timely issue, it is also important that effort be spent educating the community about solar energy science. Thus, an Energy Ambassadors' Program is proposed in which undergraduates, with guidance from senior laboratory members, return to their high schools to discuss their research through an engaging demonstration."

In contrast, very little symbolically-represented music exists, preventing music from fully participating in the Information Age. The International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) is a large and rapidly growing open library of public domain machine-printed classical music scores, actively used by many musicians, music scholars, and researchers around the world. The PI's objective in this exploratory project is to begin creating the algorithms needed for automatic optical music recognition (OMR) to convert scanned musical scores into symbolic representations. This is the first step in the PI's long-term goal of building a system to transform the library's score images into symbolic representations, bringing the IMSLP community together in a Wikipedia-like collaboration to mine this invaluable resource. The result will be a comprehensive and open music library of symbolic scores allowing unprecedented access while forming the basis of many new music applications as well as commercial potential.<br/><br/>While there have been many efforts at OMR over the last fifty years, the current state of the art is far below what the IMSLP challenge requires. Existing systems require such laborious error correction that it is not clear if they actually improve on manual data entry. OMR is much harder than its optical character recognition (OCR) counterpart due to the fundamentally two-dimensional layout of music, which makes it difficult to cast the problem in terms of familiar recognition paradigms. Thus the primary focus of the current work lies in creating and implementing an appropriate recognition paradigm suitable for the two-dimensional structure of music notation, building in knowledge of notation conventions and allowing for automatic adaptation. To this end, the PI will explore strategies that merge recognition with segmentation, express the desire for non-overlapping musical symbols in a principled way, and model the interpretation problem which understands the often ambiguous meaning of the recognized symbols.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A large open music library of symbolic scores, as well as offering widespread and easy access to one of our culture's richest traditions, will be transformative for musicians, music researchers, and music lovers. Libraries will be able to distribute music scores electronically and globally, allowing for adaptive display, ongoing scholarly annotation, and registration of scores with video and audio. The prevalence of symbolic music scores will open up a world of possibilities to music-science researchers, including systems for music information retrieval, expressive performance, automatic musical accompaniment, transcription and arranging, performance assistance, and many others. Finally, the library will enable important commercial applications. For example, many expect that devices such as the iPad will form the sheet music ""delivery systems"" of the future; the benefits of basing such digital music readers on symbolically represented music are compelling, including automatic page turning and content-based annotation."

These activities are a combination of analytical studies of design methods and interview studies with practitioners (designers who employ design methods to create products and systems) and researchers (design method developers). The research will lead to insights and principles suitable for practitioners on how to strategize and handle their choice and use of design tools, techniques, and methods, and to insights and principles suitable for organizations for their strategic choices of design methods. Most importantly, the research will lead to educational guidelines suitable for design education on how to professionally think about and handle design methods.

Finally, the PI will establish a fundamental relation between the constructions (1) and (2) via a G-version of the Drinfeld-Joyal-Street center of categories: the HQFT obtained by construction (1) from a spherical G-fusion G-category C is equivalent to the HQFT obtained by construction (2) from the appropriately defined G-center of C.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project develops new techniques in geometry arising from ideas of quantum physics. Specifically, the project will focus on the notion of Topological Field Theory introduced by the Fields medalist Edward Witten in the 1980's. Topological Field Theory allows topologists to analyze the shape of geometric objects from the microscopic viewpoint decomposing them into small elementary pieces. Mathematical formulation of Topological Field Theory given by the PI and co-authors has successfully led to creating bridges between previously unrelated areas of pure mathematics like the geometric theory of knotted strings in space on one hand, and the algebraic theory of representations and categories on the other hand. The project considerably enlarges the class of geometric objects which can be analyzed using Topological Field Theory. We include in consideration not only the objects themselves but also relations between them known in mathematics as maps or mappings. The principal aim of the project is to analyze the maps from the above mentioned microscopic viewpoint and to derive corresponding notions in algebra and theory of categories. The project will introduce and develop two different solutions to this problem and establish a subtle theorem relating these two solutions. This project will lead to a better understanding of geometric objects and their maps. It will also produce new powerful algebraic notions and techniques. Potential areas of applications outside of pure mathematics include theoretical physics and quantum computations."

People can share information concerning their location, activity, fitness, and health with their friends and family while benefiting from applications that leverage such information. Yet, users already find managing their privacy to be challenging, and the complexity involved in doing so is bound to increase. Usable techniques are required to enable people to effectively manage the dissemination of their private information as sensed by their mobile devices and sensors in their environment. <br/><br/>This project explores `sensible' privacy controls and feedback mechanisms that allow people (or automated mechanisms acting on their behalf) to respond to unanticipated patterns and actual uses of their information in a way that is usable and intuitive. This approach has two advantages: 1) people need only care about the subset of data and usage scenarios that have the potential to violate their privacy, thus reducing the amount of data to which they must regulate access; and 2) people make better decisions concerning such access when these decisions are made in a context where they know how their data is being used. <br/><br/>Sensible privacy mechanisms can have a profound and positive societal impact by not only helping people control their privacy, but also potentially increasing their participation in sensor-enabled computing because of this added control. This project firmly integrates education into the research through research experiences for underrepresented groups and the development of course modules on privacy at the undergraduate and graduate levels."

For some applications, the most expressive scheme may be overly complex and not necessarily the best fit. To this end, this project investigates the suitability analysis problem: Given a system's access control workload, a set of candidate access control schemes, and a set of application-specific cost metrics, which scheme best meets the needs of the system?<br/><br/>The goal is to create a suitability-analysis framework that is sufficiently rigorous to be useful to researchers and theoreticians, while remaining accessible to security practitioners. Such a framework will help formalize an access control scheme's application-specific strengths and limitations, enable researchers to precisely describe the scenarios for which a scheme is best suited, allow assessment of the novelty and utility of proposed schemes, and help analysts diagnose shortcomings in existing systems. In particular, the project will develop (1) an application-specific, workload-based framework for analyzing the suitability of access control schemes that is sufficiently rich to compare logical, extensional, and hybrid schemes in both sequential and concurrent systems; (2) a cost analysis component that quantifies a scheme's suitability using custom metrics; and (3) tools that automate a range of suitability analysis tasks.

Michaels <br/>IOS 1034918<br/>Regulation of flowering time by light quality<br/><br/>The proper timing of flowering is key to the reproductive success of plants. Therefore it is not surprising that flowering time is highly regulated by both environmental and internal signals. One environmental signal that can accelerate flowering is shade provided neighboring plants. Plants detect shade as a shift in the ratio of red light to far-red light. Because leaves absorb more red light than far-red light, plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in far-red light. The overarching goal of this project is to determine, at the molecular level, how plants perceive and respond to far-red enriched light. The project will employ genetic, physiological, and biochemical approaches to explore the impact of light quality on the genes and proteins that regulate flowering, identify novel components required for the acceleration of flowering by far-red-enriched light, and integrate plant hormones into the pathways that regulate flowering time in response to light quality. This project will also provide training and research experiences at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Because many flowering time pathways are highly conserved, it is expected that the knowledge gained in this study will be broadly applicable to higher plants. The molecular circuitry elucidated by this study will facilitate the study and manipulation of light responses in agricultural plants. For example, increasing plant density is a primary avenue to increasing crop yield. Because crowded plants shade one another, however, they experience far-red enriched light that can lead to yield-reducing precocious flowering. A better understanding of plant responses to light quality will allow for the manipulation of these traits, so that plants can be grown at higher density while minimizing undesirable consequences."

Software engineers rapidly develop prototypes and then iteratively refine the prototypes into production systems. However, today's programming systems do not support a smooth transition from prototyping to production. On one hand, scripting languages and interactive environments support prototyping while on the other hand conventional programming languages and optimizing compilers support the development of reusable and efficient production codes. Neither support both prototyping and production, so developers use a mixture of programming systems. This practice incurs many costs such as the impedance mismatch of inter-language data transfers and the time to translate programs between languages.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to discover the scientific principles necessary for a single programming system to effectively support the incremental refinement of prototypes into production software. To accomplish this research objective, classic conflicts between flexibility and safety and between abstraction and performance need to be resolved. To achieve both flexibility and safety, the research will investigate ways to combine dynamic and static type checking, using an approach called gradual typing. To achieve both abstraction and performance, the research will develop a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra and show how show how high-level abstractions can provide greater opportunities for compiler optimization than conventional abstractions such as loops and scalar operations. The broader impacts of the project arise from improvements to programmer productivity and software quality."

The research team will test the idea that these areas of low relief are uplifted remnants of a relict landscape that formed prior to a recent transient acceleration in rock uplift rate and that the acceleration in uplift was driven by crustal-scale imbrication as suggested by preliminary interpretations of seismic tomographic analyses. To test these linked hypotheses, the team will carry out three related lines of research: 1) geomorphology and cosmogenic analyses (detailed analysis of the topography; detailed field mapping of fluvial terraces; and determination of erosion rates for the areas of low relief primarily using 10Be); 2) field-based and crustal-scale kinematic analyses (documentation of the spatial distribution, relative age, and orientation of outcrop-scale faults and kinematics; determination of the dominant deformation mechanisms; and inversion of fault earthquake data for the shape and orientation of the strain ellipsoid); 3) thermochronometry studies. The integrated dataset from this study has the potential to transform understanding of the crustal deformation and landscape evolution of one of the type examples of an active, arc-continent collision.<br/><br/>Taiwan represents one of the most active tectonic environments on Earth. The island marks the collision between the Luzon volcanic arc and the passive margin of Asia and for decades the collision has motivated geodynamic models to explain the evolution of many mountain belts around the world. The paradigm for Taiwan is that the obliquity between the northeast-southwest trending passive margin and the north-south trending volcanic arc has led to steady southward propagation of the mountain belt and a time-for-space equivalence so that cross sections of the belt can be treated as time slices for different stages in a characteristic evolution. Moreover, the relatively constant width of the orogen has led numerous workers to argue for a topographic steady state where the influx of material is balanced by erosion. This project aims to examine the idea that the mountain belt is punctuated by episodic events that perturb the steady state system.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Earth Sciences Division Tectonics Program and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering."

Obstacles include the Internet's scale and scope, technical challenges in capturing, filtering and sampling high data rates, difficulty obtaining measurements across a decentralized network with radically distributed ownership, cost of building and operating instrumentation, and political hurdles. Even (or especially) with all these obstacles, the demand for and importance of representative Internet data sets is increasing -- which is good news for rigorous scientific Internet research. The primary driver of this demand is the growing awareness of vulnerabilities to threats to various critical and increasingly interdependent infrastructures, and that a primary limiting factor in the escalating arms race is our surprisingly still primitive approach to sharing cyberinfrastructure data.<br/><br/>CAIDA has developed an Internet Measurement Data Catalog -- IMDC -- an index of information (metadata) about data sets and their availability under various usage policies. The catalog addresses a significant challenge in network science: reducing the cost of searching for data by organizing metadata about accessible Internet data sets into a single repository.<br/><br/>This SDCI project will support integration of lessons learned thus far from IMDC development, implementation, and usage to better support the cybersecurity research and cyberinfrastructure development communities. The project's three primary deployment goals are to: (1) reduce the burden on those contributing data via a streamlined interface and tools for easier indexing, annotation and navigation of relevant data; (2) convert from use of a proprietary database backend (Oracle) to a completely open source solution; and (3) expand the catalog's relevance to the cybersecurity and other research communities via workshops, new emphasis on security-relevant data sets, and creation of public web forums to discuss data-sharing issues.<br/><br/>Although the focus for this project is<br/>utility for the cybersecurity and cyberinfrastructure research community, our proposed design objectives and outreach plans explicitly target a range of science and engineering communities.<br/>In particular, we believe the proposed software development can support and promote NSF's newly announced Data Sharing Policy, which as of January 2011 requires all proposals to include a plan for how researchers intend to share their data with other researchers.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed software development activities is a range of measurable benefits to cyberinfrastructure research: maximizing the re-use of existing Internet data; decreasing the time spent collecting redundant data; reducing the effort needed to start a new study; promoting validation and reproducibility of analyses and r intellectual merit of cyberinfrastructure research methods: maximizing the re-use of existing Internet data; decreasing the time spent collecting redundant data; reducing the effort needed to start a new study; promoting validation and reproducibility of analyses and results; enabling longitudinal and cross-disciplinary studies of the Internet; and opening up new cross-domain areas of transformative networking research.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are diverse. The success of the catalog and related workshops will facilitate wide dissemination of Internet measurement data to researchers and security experts across academic, commercial, and government sectors.<br/>By including education-oriented data collections in the catalog, this project creates an immediate link between research and education, and improves access to Internet research for underrepresented groups in computer science and engineering. Most importantly, the software created through this project will help other disciplines and sectors to develop their own catalog instances to support the type of data management plans now articulated as essential to NSF."

Almost 3.9 million students were taking at least one online course during the Fall 2007 term. This represents 21.9% of the total enrollment in Fall 2007, up from 9.9% in Fall 2002. Over 80% of the 3.9 million students are studying at the undergraduate level. Public institutions and community colleges have seen the highest rate of increase in online courses including the science disciplines with the exception of engineering. In order to reach all students taking undergraduate science courses, efforts need to focus on creating a variety of effective cyberlearning environments. <br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is producing and studying the tools and conditions required for enhanced cyberlearning through Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL). The project investigates how technology can be used to enhance an educational strategy that already has proven beneficial in STEM courses. To accomplish this goal, the project is creating a cyber PLTL (cPLTL), an online collaborative environment for conducting PLTL Workshops; studying the effectiveness of a cPLTL environment in duplicating the proven benefits of the traditional, face-to-face PLTL method; examining the effectiveness of the existing PLTL materials in cPLTL Workshops; modifying the existing training course for the peer leaders to be effective facilitators in the cPLTL model; developing brief technology training for students learning chemistry in cPLTL workshops; and articulating the critical components vital to successful implementation of a cPLTL program. An evaluation is gathering data on the process of development and implementation of cPLTL. The evaluation also includes a quasi-experimental study of how cPLTL compares to traditional PLTL sections that are taught at the same time.<br/>Broader Impacts: cPLTL has the potential to increase participation and retention of underrepresented groups in the STEM fields by providing active learning and leadership opportunities to a more diverse group of students in a flexible time frame. Also, cPLTL has the potential to strengthen the ability of community colleges to recruit students, who typically leave the institution after the sophomore year, to serve as peer leaders. In addition, if successful, cPLTL implementation will encourage adoption by other chemistry courses, STEM disciplines, and institutions, especially those with large non-traditional and commuter student populations. While research on cPLTL is not within the scope of this project, other complementary projects are probing a number of research questions. The cPLTL environment allows data collection on student interactions by capturing chat sessions, written collaboration, voice recordings, and video. This captured and saved data allows for research on student interactions in cPLTL, which has not been possible at this level of detail in face-to-face PLTL Workshops."

Through creative combinations of spam and social engineering, attackers regularly lure end users into visiting phishing sites, malware-hosting sites, and scam sites. One popular defense mechanism against Web-based attacks is blacklisting, but today's blacklists suffer from three fundamental deciencies. First, most of them employ a combination of Web crawling and human intervention to infer malicious sites. This adds an inherent delay in adding entries and causes many malicious sites to be missed. Second, blacklists are mostly based on exact URL strings, and hence unable to adapt to simple changes to the URLs that attackers are using today to evade detection. Third, as blacklist entries grow, matching them against URLs in real-time could create performance bottlenecks. To overcome these deficiencies, this project is developing novel mechanisms to aid in the construction, maintenance, and matching of blacklists in real time. Specifically, it is developing a scalable architecture that can discover new malicious websites by passively observing the onset of new techniques exploited by the miscreants, such as redirects and fast flux in network traffic. The architecture also leverages common attacker tendencies to find novel and automated ways of discovering new malicious URLs from existing blacklisted URLs. The final thrust of the project is on developing high-speed approximate matching algorithms for effective in-network blacklisting to match URLs embedded in packets against potentially millions of blacklist entries. If successful, this project will make the Web safer for millions of Internet users."

Irrigated land is responsible for more than 85 percent of global consumptive water use, producing approximately 45 percent of the global food supply on only 20 percent of global cropland. The combination of the increasing use of irrigation in agricultural production and the importance of snowmelt in many agricultural areas has led to a situation where more than one-sixth of the world's population relies on glaciers and seasonal snow packs as their primary source of streamflow. Climate change processes are projected to impact the amount of snowfall and the seasonality of discharge around the globe. Temperature effects of climate change alone will be sufficient to alter both snowpack accumulation and snowmelt dynamics of many agricultural systems. While additional climate change impacts on growing season rainfall, streamflow, and drought could serve to either exacerbate or mitigate shifts in snowmelt climatology on water available for crops, the dependence on snowmelt and irrigation in many agricultural systems may reduce their ability to respond to future changes. Of additional concern is the fact that many temperate and tropical agricultural areas dependent on glacial meltwater are now facing the threat of complete glacier loss, making climate changes in these regions potentially more disruptive than in areas where only seasonal snowmelt is used as a water resource. In the face of water shortages, governance institutions established to allocate water may be disrupted and forced to change. Critical tensions exist between the potential impacts of climate change and existing and future patterns of water use in regions highly dependent on glacier-fed streamflow for agricultural irrigation. This interdisciplinary research project will examine how human populations will be impacted by these changes and the capacity of users in glacier-irrigated agricultural systems to adapt. The investigators will examine semi-arid agricultural systems that are dependent on snowmelt located across strongly contrasting institutional and hydrological settings in eastern Kenya and the western United States. They will integrate information gathered from focus groups, water-user interviews, field hydrological measurements, role-playing games, and scenario-based models of potential climate change impacts to assess community vulnerability to climate variability and understand how communities might respond to changes in water availability in the future. They will address interactions among human actors, the physical and social capital they construct and maintain, and the dynamics of water availability and allocation across spatial scales.<br/><br/>This project will have significant implications for the governance of water resources and how communities and households cope with water scarcity. The empirical analysis of past and present water governance will support the development of scenario-based models of potential climate change impacts to assess community vulnerability to climate variability and to understand how communities might respond to changes in water availability in the future. Findings from this project will be of value to policy makers who are seeking more nuanced policy responses than simple ""one size fits all"" solutions.

Specifically, the project will investigate the issues of (a) current knowledge and change over time on specific mathematics skills, (b) the extent to which the performance is related to specific mathematics curricula, and (c) the connection between courses taken in high school and mathematics performance. Whenever possible, results will be disaggregated by demographic variables, including SES and race/ethnicity variables available in the NAEP data set. Results of the study will point to aspects of the curriculum that impact performance and will identify mathematics concept and skill clusters where student knowledge is underdeveloped. <br/><br/>Both the Main and LTT mathematics assessments are representative of the nation as a whole. They contain items aligned with frameworks established by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) with consideration not only to mathematics-specific content but also to the cognitive processes involved in arriving at a solution. By partnering with researchers who are familiar with the secure items used on NAEP, analyses conducted will allow for description of skills measured by NAEP that portray the mathematics skills of U.S. students across a variety of topics. One of the unique aspects of this project is that data from the Main and LTT NAEPs will be pooled to provide richer data that encompass a body of key mathematics concepts and skills. The item equating process will begin with content analyses to match Main and LTT items that involve the same cognitive processes and solution algorithms. The research team anticipates that content analyses will result in multiple item clusters at each age level. The project will take a bi-directional focus, at times focusing on students' current knowledge while at other times focusing on how the mathematics knowledge of students today compares to knowledge of students 15 to 30 years ago. An external advisory board will provide input on the analyses and an external evaluation team will evaluate the project. <br/><br/>The primary indicator for success of the project will be the extent to which the research products benefit school personnel, curriculum developers, and other researchers. Building upon the last two edited volumes on NAEP mathematics results published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, project researchers will produce articles and a book that go beyond existing baseline data on student knowledge on major topics in the mathematics curriculum. Results will provide a stronger statistical basis for making claims about change in student knowledge over time and a broader picture of accomplishment at the level of individual items. This may provide important implications for curriculum and teacher development."

For example, people are routinely asked by their systems whether to accept a security certificate, install an application, heed security warnings, or reconfigure operating-system security settings. While these examples represent situations in which people regularly find themselves, people rarely have any basis to make an informed decision or to establish one conveniently. This research examines the concept of 'crowdsourced security' where the solution lies in people leveraging members of their community to secure their systems and devices.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to determine the potential of crowdsourcing as a complementary strategy for enhancing security. An example challenge addressed in this research pertains to the security of one's personal data. Specifically the research seeks to develop security mechanisms that can exploit naturally occurring social relationships and utilize 'human computation' to shift the burden of security via authentication from machines to humans. Within this framework, the research investigates both questions about the technical effectiveness of crowdsourced security solutions, as well as socio-behavioral questions about users' preferences, motivations, and privacy concerns about such systems. This research will benefit society by producing a deeper understanding of how systems can be better secured through human participation and collaboration, moving beyond the status quo of current security mechanisms."

David Polly<br/> How do communities and species respond to environmental change? This question is important to conservation ecologists, biologists and paleontologists because the answers help understand what principles influence which species are found together in a community, how those species and their community will respond to changing climates and environments, and how we can better determine past climates and environments from assemblages of fossils in the geological record. <br/>This project will focus on how climatic and environmental parameters in North America are associated with the average locomotion and diet in terrestrial carnivores from two major biological groups, the mammalian Carnivora and snakes, each of which have their individual physiological and locomotor specializations, but both of which function ecologically as high-trophic level carnivores in the same communities. The project will study how two properties of the species coexisting in communities ? locomotion and diet ? are associated with climate and environment on a continental scale. We expect that species within a community will each be specialized for their own niches, but at the same time we expect that the large-scale climate and environment in a local area will restrict the range of differentiation that is possible within a community (all species living in an arctic tundra community, for example, must share specializations that allow them to live in that environment). Our goal is to determine the extent to which climate and environment are associated with the geographic distribution of locomotor and dietary specializations to assess the possibility of inferring past local terrestrial climates and environment from fossil communities using these systems.<br/>Our approach is quantitative and geographically comprehensive. From museum collections, we will take measurements of limbs, bodies, and dentitions of carnivorans and snakes from across North America, with the goal of obtaining a sample of 20 or more individuals for every North American species in these two groups and of obtaining samples of 10 or more across the entire geographic range of selected widespread species. We will also measure limbs and dentitions from Pleistocene carnivorans in order to apply our results to late Quaternary paleoenvironment reconstruction. These measurements will be assembled using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to map the community-level patterns in locomotion and diet across the whole of North America to study how they are associated with climatic parameters and we will reconstruct Pleistocene climate and environment from this association and test that reconstruction against climate models based on other lines of evidence."

Among many other benefits, it detects the knot genus (the least complicated surface whose boundary is the knot), and in particular, whether a knot is non-trivial. It is a homology theory, and like many homology theories the Euler characteristic is interesting: for knots, the Euler characteristic is one of the oldest knot invariants, the Alexander polynomial. Heegaard Floer homology is part of a family of recent homology theories whose Euler characteristic gives other knot polynomials. But it can be hard to compute, and is defined by ad-hoc rules rather than a concise set of properties. In this project, we will develop a theory of bordered homology invariants: extend the Heegaard Floer homology and other homology theories to objects (knots or 3-manifolds) with boundary, so that when a knot or manifold is split into pieces the invariant for the whole can be computed from the invariants for the pieces. Among other benefits, this will make the theory more computable, and give axioms for the theory.<br/><br/>Although knot theory has been studied for many centuries, some of the most elementary questions, such as finding the least complicated surface whose boundary lies on the knot, are still not easy to answer. Heegaard Floer homology is one recent theory that answers this and many other questions in knot theory and topology. However, it is hard to compute even for relatively small knots. In this project, I and my collaborators will extend Heegaard Floer homology (and other related theories) so that they can be computed for pieces of a knot and then built up to the complete knot. This promises to provide a great computational and theoretical tool. Throughout the project, accessibility will be emphasized, and the project will be integrated with, for instance, an undergraduate research program."

Related problems to study are several possible estimates of symplectic capacities. A second project, with D. Gay, will describe 3-dimensional contact analogues of 4-dimensional ellipsoid embeddings. An array of 3-dimensional contact techniques will be used with possible applications to the 4-dimensional symplectic embedding questions. In a third objective the PI continues previous work using J-holomorphic curves techniques to pursue topological aspects of symplectomorphism groups of manifolds such as ruled 4-dimensional surfaces.<br/><br/>In contrast with classical geometries, symplectic geometry is predominantly built around the notion of area (of two dimensional symplectic submanifolds). Embedding and packing questions are fundamental rigidity questions originally motivated by Hamiltonian dynamics, and the quest for recurrence properties of Hamiltonian automorphisms. Answers to such packing questions will guide our understanding of symplectic spaces. Due to their very computational nature, these problems have the possibility of involving students in guided computer experimentation."

Although historically they have not played a major role in traditional scientific computing, their importance is rapidly increasing with the emergence of informatics and data-centric applications. Although many graph analysis tasks are performed sequentially today, problem sizes continue to grow, necessitating the increasing use of parallel computing. Parallel graph algorithms are already being written, but with great effort and limited code reuse. A major issue in current ways of implementing parallel graph algorithms is the lack of performance portability: not only is it often required to reimplement algorithms on different platforms for the best performance, it is frequently also necessary to completely redesign them.<br/><br/>To avoid this rewriting and thus increase scientists' productivity, this project will study domain-specific programming languages allowing graph algorithms to be expressed portably, while using compilation techniques that allow the high-level expressions to achieve performance competitive with hand-written, low-level code for these algorithms. Domain-specific languages have already shown benefit in multiple application areas. This project will extend their benefits further in the graph domain, including to more platforms and data representations than in the past. In particular, the project goals include finding abstractions common to the expressions of graph applications on different platforms, as well as between different applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these abstractions, the project includes the creation of prototype implementations of graph algorithms for a variety of high-performance computing platforms and the evaluation of the high-level versions of algorithms against comparable low-level versions."

In particular, they will investigate how to determine the dynamical degrees in all dimensions. The second component of this project investigates the existence of automorphisms of positive entropy in complex surfaces and 3-folds. The third component is focused on the complex Henon family of dynamical systems, which has served as an important model family. These dynamical systems are represented by quite simple polynomials, but they exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors. They have been important because many observed phenomena can actually be proved mathematically.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project is related to the field of study of chaos theory, which has applications to several disciplines, including physics, engineering, economics and biology. An important phenomenon in chaos theory is the so-called butterfly effect, which illustrates the unstable dependence on initial conditions for a given dynamical system. The Henon functions studied in this project have been a fertile testing ground for transformations that have simple formulas but which exhibit the butterfly effect. The study of birational maps has applications to the field of Lattice Statistical Mechanics (LSM) which considers materials that have a lattice structure like crystals. LSM provides a formula for determining the energy and temperature of such a material in terms of the various interaction energies between the atoms in the lattice. This formula is very difficult to compute, but in many cases there are fundamental symmetries which lead to substantial simplifications. These symmetries are given by birational maps such as those studied in this project, and the amount of simplification is given by the degree complexity."

Recent advances in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable the continuous monitoring of various physical phenomena at unprecedented high spatial densities and long time durations, hence opening exciting new opportunities for numerous scientific endeavors. Since sensor nodes are unattended and batterypowered, network monitoring/tomography from indirect measurements at the sink(s) and energy conservation are critical in the deployment of large-scale environmental WSNs. Therefore, a viable framework for energy-efficient network monitoring and data collection is fundamentally important to significantly improve WSN management/operations and reduce its deployment costs.<br/><br/>This project investigates the energy-efficient network monitoring/tomography and data collections in large-scale outdoor WSNs, based on the recent breakthrough of compressed sensing (CS) through an integrated theoretical and empirical approach. The project studies WSN topology tomography for dynamic routing under wireless link dynamics due to channel fading and interference. The objectives of this project are to develop a novel and rigorous framework of topology tomography for real-world WSNs operated in highly noisy communication environments. Dynamic routing topology recovery algorithms are devised for both complete indirect measurements and incomplete indirect measurements received at the sink(s). The accuracy of the tomography approach is studied both analytically and empirically. The developed WSN topology tomography framework can be essential not only for WSN's routing improvement, topology control, hot spot elimination, and anomaly detection in practice, but also for emerging CS-based data collection. This approach extends the current CS technology to form a unified framework for network tomography and data collection in large-scale WSNs, upon which energy-efficient WSN topology tomography and data gathering protocol suite is developed. The developed framework and protocol suite will be validated and evaluated in a real-world environmental WSN testbed in a hilly watershed.<br/><br/>The project intends to create a new paradigm of optimal design, development, and management/operations for large-scale WSNs to significantly extend their lifetime. This would lead to a substantial reduction of the prohibitive cost of large-scale WSN deployments for scientific, civic, national security, and military purposes in the near future. The project creates an interdisciplinary educational practice for both undergraduate and graduate students through hands-on experience with a real-world WSN testbed. The outreach includes summer camps and scientific projects for school students using the WSN testbed."

Such condition-dependent signals may reveal current health status and thus reflect genetic resistance to pathogens. In fact, signal expression is related to immune status in a number of species investigated to date. However, the relationships between ""honest"" indicators of quality and immunity have not been adequately evaluated in primates. Despite this fact, much work in primatology and human evolutionary biology is based on assumptions that these signals are indicative of immunity, and that they are related in complex ways to hormone levels. To evaluate these assumptions, a team of scholars with combined expertise will measure body condition, behavior, endocrine function, and immune function in 150 adult male and 150 adult female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), each sampled during breeding and non-breeding seasons at the Tulane National Primate Research Center. It is hypothesized that sex skin coloration is an honest indicator of robust immunocompetence, and that both coloration and immunocompetence are modulated in part by the functions of various hormones. <br/><br/>Investigating the immunomodulatory actions of hormones allows greater understanding of the evolutionary significance of immune-endocrine interactions and provides a unique life-historical perspective on mammalian immune function. Research to clarify these interactions in nonhuman primates will provide a valuable comparative and evolutionary perspective to selection in our own species. The project also offers valuable training opportunities to graduate, undergraduate and high school students of diverse backgrounds to become members of a collaborative research community and learn sophisticated laboratory techniques and their applications. Another important applied aspect of this project includes the organization of a workshop on biomarkers in evolutionary anthropology. Future project development will include additional hormone and genetic analyses in remaining samples collected and stored from the current project."

Most importantly, horned beetles are easily kept in captivity and amenable to experimental analysis, including genetic manipulations and genome-wide expression studies. This research uses these approaches to investigate regulation and evolution of gender- and nutrition-dependent growth and differentiation.

This project aims to develop intelligent clinical decision support techniques for recommending optimal action plans - including both diagnostic tests and medical interventions - for treating chronic disease, performing multi-step and adaptive treatments, and modifying long-term health habits. In an effort to integrate evidence-driven decision-making with established clinical practices, the research will develop disease-agnostic artificial intelligence techniques that combine data from large electronic health records (EHRs) with recommendations from human experts. A prototype decision support system will be tested on three clinical settings - cardiology, clinical depression, and emergency room readmission - using existing EHR datasets and consultation with domain experts from clinical partners. Outcomes-driven and cost-driven optimized decisions will be compared to current clinical practice. This exploratory research will provide the groundwork for follow-up projects in decision support information presentation, integration with clinical workflow and IT systems, and making the transition from retrospective studies to clinical trials. Other broader impacts include workshops for healthcare applications of AI, and women and minority students will be recruited and mentored in graduate and undergraduate computer science research.<br/><br/>The technical approach of this research builds on state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to automatically learn, simulate, and reason about patient-specific treatment plans. Such methods must be simultaneously probabilistic and temporal. Probabilistic techniques are needed to handle significant uncertainties in clinical diagnoses and outcomes, much like a human clinician would. Temporal techniques are needed to consider sequences of future decisions over the course of treatment, rather than decisions at single time points. More specifically, this project will consider the use of statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to mine for probabilistic, temporal patterns in large electronic health records, and these patterns will be used in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that exhaustively search for optimal treatment sequences. Recent results indicate that SRL achieves superior performance to other machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest from demographic and lifestyle observations, and POMDP treatment plans outperform existing fee-for-service practices by reducing costs by 50% and improving outcomes by 40% on a clinical depression dataset. By combining SRL and POMDPs, specifically, using SRL to learn a disease progression model used by the POMDP, this project aims to achieve further improvements in recommendation quality and computational scalability for complex treatments. Furthermore, because EHRs may suffer from limited or missing data, clinical decision support tools should follow established practices and expert knowledge when necessary. To do so, new workflows for integrating expert knowledge into SRL and POMDPs will be explored. Evaluation will be performed on a variety of disease scenarios in conjunction with clinical partners at Marshfield Clinic, Centerstone, Wake Forest School of Medicine, and South Bend Memorial Hospital."

For instance, much is known about the genetic and developmental basis that enable legs or wings to become longer, or eyes to become more efficient in a given environment. However, little remains known about how major complex traits, such as legs, wings or eyes, originate in the first place. What does it take to evolve the first limb, or wing, or eye, from a limbless and blind ancestor? <br/><br/>This research investigates the origin and diversification of novel traits using the unique, diverse and morphologically spectacular horns of beetles as focal traits. Beetle horns are produced in body regions in which other insects do not produce outgrowths, are highly variable in shape and size, and endow their bearers with an ecologically important function: a weapon to be used in combat between rival males over females. Beetle horns thus offer an outstanding opportunity to investigate the genetic and developmental means by which novel traits come into being and are elaborated upon as a group of organisms diversifies. <br/><br/>Specifically, this research uses molecular genetic and developmental approaches to investigate the regulation of growth, shape, and positioning of traditional appendages (such as legs or wings) and recently evolved, novel appendages (such as horns). In doing so, this research aims to identify the degree to which innovation and diversification in nature are enabled by novel genes and developmental pathways, or the re-use and modification of existing genes and pathways, or combinations of these two alternatives. As such it addresses a fundamental, unresolved question in evolutionary and developmental biology: how novelty can arise in nature from within the confines of ancestral variation. <br/><br/>Lastly, this research interfaces tightly with several educational and outreach efforts. (1) Using a collaboration with a local children's museum for science, health and technology this research will help provide training and educational resources in insect biology to approximately 180 local and regional K-12 teachers over the course of 3 years. (2) This research will help train at least 8 young scientists (6 undergraduate students, 1 graduate student, 1 postdoc) in intensive interdisciplinary research. (3) Lastly, it will facilitate educational outreach by helping recruit 6 high school teachers and 6 minority high school students for summer research immersion and introduce them to research in development, evolution, and ecology."

Critically, because this language will be extremely general and will not be tied to a particular set of ideas or theory, scientists from competing perspectives will be able to frame their ideas using a common vocabulary, something that is not currently possible. In addition, since this language will be mathematical, it will possess an exceptional level of rigor and internal consistency. Finally, this language will demonstrate its utility and power by being applied to a set of thorny issues in the contemporary study of perceptual organization."

They focus in the discipline of life sciences, with specific focus on complex biological systems. The approach to learning about complex systems is through participatory simulation augmented by wearable computers. Children act out the roles of agents in complex biological systems (e.g., bees gathering honey, predators and preys) together, and with the help of electronic puppets that they can wear on one hand, they watch changes in the characteristics of animals they are simulating (e.g., energy, hunger, thirst, need for sleep) as they interact in the environment the way those animals would. Research focuses on how learning happens in the context of 1st person participation in a simulated system and how to best facilitate that learning, how learning about one complex system readies children to learn about other complex systems, how the understanding of complex systems builds over time with exposure to a variety of such systems, and best ways of using technology to affect such learning.<br/><br/>There is little understanding currently of how to teach science productively in elementary school. As is appropriate for this age group, these PIs take a playful approach to immersing youngsters (in grades K through 3) in the lives of animals and organisms and the ecosystems they live in. Children participate in simulations of natural ecosystems, taking on the roles of animals or organisms in those systems. To promote the kinds of reflection on experience that will lead to learning, children are equipped with electronic puppets that help them experience how those animals? lives are affected by their interactions with animal and plant life in their environment."

They report on all aspects of distributed computing technology, such as grids and clouds. They also regularly feature articles on distributed computing-enabled research in a large variety of disciplines, including physics, biology, sociology, earth sciences, archaeology, medicine, disaster management, crime, and art. (Note that they do not cover stories that are purely about commercial technology) In its current incarnation, iSGTW is also an online destination where you can host a profile and blog, and find and disseminate announcements and information about events, deadlines, and jobs. What many people outside of particle physics may not know is that distributed computing played a crucial role in the race towards the discovery of the Higgs Boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. <br/><br/>At present, each issue of iSGTW includes three feature articles, a visual, and a spotlight. Visuals present opportunities to showcase something graphic in nature, such as scientific visualizations, while spotlights feature a variety of links, news articles, papers, and so forth. Both items are typically written in a more casual style, with only a small amount of text. iSGTW feature articles are typically 500 - 1,500 words, but sometimes run longer. iSGTW coverage attempts to be rigorously neutral, never favoring projects affiliated with its funding source or Advisory Board, and maintaining balance across world regions. <br/><br/>The iSGTW website, re-launched in January 2011, also has a number of new and exciting community service features. Readers can post announcements, advertise jobs, and add events to the calendar and everything appears on the front page. News feeds on related topics also appeal to readers looking for more background. Similarly, the website has basic social networking functionality: visitors can leave comments, share content, create profiles, and blog.<br/><br/>A large proportion of the news stories covering cyberinfrastructure-enabled research do not mention the computational side of the story. By publishing well-written science stories that explain the computational aspects of the research, iSGTW ensures that taxpayers, policy makers, and other interested readers understand the role of cyberinfrastructure in scientific endeavors.<br/><br/>As a long-established publication, iSGTW has earned the trust of a range of audiences. Furthermore, as an international collaboration with the explicit support of diverse cyberinfrastructures (such as the Open Science Grid and XSEDE), iSGTW is better able to maintain impartiality and credibility, as compared to publications from individual institutions. The general public and members of the press are more likely to give weight to the stories iSGTW runs, and news outlets are more likely to pick them up.<br/><br/>This theory is supported by the growing number of journalists subscribing to iSGTW. In the July 2009 reader survey, only 3% of iSGTW readers identified as journalists. In the most recent survey, that rose to 7%. The subscription list currently includes approximately 130 journalists, not counting those affiliated with foreign-language media. Publications represented include The New York Times, NPR, Science/AAAS, and the Washington Post. iSGTW's email subscriber list has grown to approximately 8,180 today. Web readership is split evenly between the US and the EU, with approximately 40% of viewers hailing from each continent. Viewers from the Asia Pacific region constitute another 13%. Four percent are from the Central and South American sub-continents. The remainder are from Western Asia, the Middle East, and Africa."

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide and yet its pathogenesis and treatment are not fully understood. Glaucoma is primarily associated with elevated intraocular pressure and is treated with interventions that lower this pressure. Paradoxically, it has been observed that many people develop glaucoma despite relatively low intraocular pressure and that many people never develop glaucoma despite elevated intraocular pressure. A link between impaired ocular circulation and glaucoma has been identified and helps to explain this paradox. It is unclear, however, if alterations in blood flow are a cause or effect of the retinal cell death associated with glaucoma. Therefore, the objective of this study is to use a mathematical model of ocular blood flow regulation and tissue perfusion and oxygenation to determine whether hemodynamic alterations are primary or secondary to glaucomatous damage. Specifically, the effects of impaired vascular regulation mechanisms and elevated intraocular pressure on blood flow will be compared using model simulations. These effects will be related to model predictions of tissue oxygenation in order to understand whether impaired ocular circulation causes cell death or if cell death is the cause of impaired circulation.<br/><br/>The results of this study will aid the interpretation of clinical measurements of eye structure and blood flow and provide insight for new treatment strategies for glaucoma. The non-standard techniques required to obtain model solutions are active areas of research in mathematics, and thus this project will provide significant contributions to both medical and mathematical fields. Moreover, conducting studies in the eye is of particular importance because it is the only environment in the human body where blood flow and systemic vascular features can be observed and measured easily and non-invasively down to a very small level (capillary vessels). These measurements identify risk indicators not only of glaucoma but also of many systemic diseases currently diminishing the quality of human life, including diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis. By combining theoretical interpretations and descriptions of underlying principles of human physiology with experimental and clinical measurements, this study has a unique potential to impact the knowledge and treatment of multiple diseases."

For instance, extraverts commonly seek out interactions with unfamiliar individuals, while introverts consistently seek out interaction with fewer more familiar individuals. Thus, personality may shape an individual's behavioral development by exposing them to different social experiences from an early age. Recently there has been increasing awareness that like humans, animals also possess personality traits. The proposed research will investigate how variation in a personality trait, sociability, shapes behavioral development in Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Cowbirds, like many other species, rely on social interaction in order to learn new skills and behaviors. Sociability describes an individual's tendency to seek out interaction with others. More sociable cowbirds will approach and interact with more individuals more often than less sociable cowbirds. Two studies will investigate if: 1) Variation in sociability predicts the development of adult like behavior in juvenile cowbirds, and 2) if early experience with more or less sociable adults shapes the development of juvenile personality traits. A new RFID based video system will be used in both studies to identify individuals and record their social behaviors over long periods of time. This system will allow measurement of the details of sociability and social behavior in a way that was unavailable to researchers before. Statistical time series models can be implemented to uncover how an individual's sociability reflects the development of new behaviors over the first year of life. In the second experiment, statistical time series models will be used to uncover if experience with more sociable adults can predict the emergence of adult-like behavior within a juvenile cowbirds' first year. These results will provide insights into how early personality differences shape the development of behavior by determining how individuals interact and learn from others.<br/><br/>Data will be stored and available at http://datadryad.org/"

Yet these apparently disparate classes of computing devices have many properties and requirements in common and, in fact, are converging. Power, reliability, multicore, efficiency, and programmability are among the many demands that these two historically separate forms share. The multicore challenge demands a new strategy for organizing and conducting concurrent tasks, which is referred to as a ""model of computation"" or alternatively an ""execution model"". Typically embedded computers have been programmed individually by cores to guarantee real-time operation. But as their performance requirements grow, embedded processors will have to depend on multiple cores to achieve needed response time. Supercomputers are relying on multicore components with exponentially growing number of cores per socket to deliver increased performance with technology advances. This project is producing a new version of the ParalleX execution model to support embedded real-time multicore operation while imbuing future supercomputers with the semantics of real-time for introspection, enabling dynamic adaptive resource management and task scheduling. This further advances future supercomputers, as a current trend is to replace heavyweight cores such as the IBM Power architecture or the Intel x86 architecture with lightweight cores similar to embedded processors like the IBM PowerPC architecture or the Intel Xeon Phi architecture. Other supercomputer projects are exploring the use of the ARM embedded cores for high performance systems. The availability of the ParalleX real-time execution model will unify both embedded control computers and high performance computers for mutual support and benefit. Key results of this project will be a new runtime system that can serve both embedded and high performance computing systems and a programming interface to facilitate scalable application development of both.<br/><br/>The project's broader significance is that it will dramatically strengthen US competitiveness in both realms of computing-critical domains and enhance the nation?s economic development while addressing key challenges to the advancement of both. The field of supercomputing is facing a major challenge in how to continue to exploit technology advancement and the ParalleX execution model augmented with real-time introspection is providing the guiding principles to support co-design of architecture, programming methods, and system software and tools. Embedded control computers need to be able to use parallel processing with a single-system image for ease of programming and adaptive resource utilization. ParalleX will provide this capability. Finally, through the work of this project, future embedded processors will become the building blocks of the next generation of high performance computing to achieve exascale performance by decade's end."

As a result, many computing tasks have to be run on individual organizations? internal systems whenever they touch even a very small amount of sensitive information.<br/><br/>The research in this project seeks practical solutions to this critical security challenge. The PIs are working on an approach to split a computing job over a hybrid-cloud platform, delegating to a public cloud the computation over public data, while keeping the computation on sensitive data within a private cloud. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs are developing a privacy-aware MapReduce system, which transparently partitions a computing job and schedules its components across the public/private clouds according to the security levels of the data involved. The system is designed to achieve high security assurance and outsource most of its workload when possible, at small computational and communication overheads. It includes support for analyzing and transforming the code for legacy jobs as well as developing new jobs. We are also working to extend these techniques to facilitate other secure work-flow processing over hybrid clouds.

This will give all project stakeholders a voice in the software and will clear the proprietary fog that surrounds cyberinfrastructure services. The benefits of SciGaP services are not restricted to scientific fields, but can be used to accelerate progress in any field of endeavor that is limited by access to computational resources. SciGaP services will be usable by a community of any size, whether it is an individual, a lab group, a department, an institution, or an international community.

While new programming models seek to make network reconfiguration easier, none provide tools to solve the joint problem of software-controlled routing and placement of in-network computational services. This project will design and build a domain specific language (DSL), called Flange, for managing services in networks. The project's approach marshalls configurable forwarding and computing devices in the network, with pervasive monitoring to support service adaptation. The project includes building and releasing a prototype compiler, runtime, system and front-ends that enable Flange programming both with dedicated syntax (standalone DSL) and embedded in host languages. <br/><br/>The success criteria for this project is that a network administrator using the prototype is able to set a new service (e.g. video-transcoding) using less than a page of Flange code. Using the same mechanism, a network engineer should be able to launch a persistent function that monitors network conditions and responds to saturation by redirecting traffic to an alternate path. The novelty of the project is twofold. First, the semantic foundation at the root of the project treats both hardware and software aspects of networks uniformly, as constituting a single process network. For example, the project models forwarding as an in-the-network service, while considering it in the same light as other potentially instantiated services in the network such as transcoding or compression. Second, the Flange language will provide novel global view programming abstractions for large networks. Flange programs will be able to inspect network entities, aggregate information, signal and respond to events, all without reference to their own place of execution (which is often physically distributed). <br/><br/>The work proposed here stands to impact network operational efficiency and flexibility for national science-focused cyberinfrastructure as well as in commercial applications, where the economic impact of networked computing is clear. In addition, the design decisions the underly Flange are pedagogically relevant and will be presented in courses taught by the PIs."

This, in turn, would lead to a substantial reduction of the current prohibitive cost of WSN deployment, and thus could be high-reward for the deployment of large-scale monitoring WSNs for scientific, civic, national security, and military purposes in the near future.

Key to this primary productivity is the axial extension of plant stems into the atmosphere where leaves can capture sunlight and exchange gases. The same axial growth process drives roots into the soil to find water, nutrients and a stable footing for the organism. This project is focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which seed plants execute this axial growth plan at a cellular level. Seed plants have taken one of the major polymer systems found in all eukaryotic cells, the microtubules, and repurposed them as patterning agents. The plant cell creates specific patterns of microtubules just underneath the cell's membrane that act as templates for the construction of the fibrous walls created on the outside of the cell. It is the cell wall that ultimately gives the plant its structure and rigidity. The finely detailed nanofabrication of the plant cell wall underlies the ability of all seed plants to extend axially up into the sunlight or down into the soil. This work employs modern molecular genetic techniques and advanced cell biological methods in the Arabidopsis model system with the aim of discovering what genes are specifically required for organizing the microtubule arrays for axial cell growth.<br/><br/>Broader impacts<br/>The basic science being performed impacts several areas of practical and commercial interest. Crop plant plot density is directly dependent upon the axial growth habit (e.g. corn or soybean fields).

For example, as the cost of personal genome sequencing rapidly plummets many genetics applications will soon be within reach of individuals such as comparing one?s genome with the genomes of different groups of participants in a study to determine which treatment is likely to be most effective. Such comparisons could have tremendous value, but are currently infeasible because of the privacy concerns both for the individual and study participants. What is needed is a way to produce the result of the comparison without exposing either party's private inputs. The ultimate aim of this project is to make privacy-preserving computation practical and accessible enough to be used routinely in applications such as personalized genetics, medical research, and privacy-preserving biometrics.<br/><br/>Theoretical solutions to this problem, known as secure multi-party computation, have been known for several decades, including a general solution developed by Andrew Yao based on garbled circuits. Because of its extensive memory use and computational cost, however, the garbled circuits approach has traditionally been considered more of a theoretical curiosity than a practical mechanism for building privacy-preserving applications. Recent developments in cryptographic techniques and new implementation approaches are beginning to change this, however, and admit the possibility of scalable, practical secure computation. This project is designing methods for avoiding the memory bottleneck associated with garbled circuit evaluation by aggressively pipelining circuit generation and evaluation, and exploring a variety of techniques for reducing the size of garbled circuits. Another issue the limits the use of secure computation in practice is the need for standard protocols to assume an honest-but-curious adversary who always follows the specified protocol. This project is developing new techniques for dealing with malicious adversaries, improving the standard cut-and-choose and commit-and-prove approaches by using new cryptographic tools and exploring an alternate model in which a verifiable trusted party generates the circuit but is not trusted with any private data. The project is also developing techniques to audit the information that can be inferred from the result of a secure computation. Another goal is to make secure computation more accessible to developers by developing programming tools for defining secure computations at a high level, based on information-flow analysis and program partitioning."

The latter case can arise when the low-energy electron physics is controlled by a Dirac equation, of which an important example is that of graphene. The former is realized in systems that may be effectively described as a quantum magnet. The quantum Hall bilayer offers a unique environment to probe this physics because its topological structures carry physical charge, and it allows experimental probes that are not possible in other realizations. This project focuses on these two systems as paradigms for how topological structure and textures can affect electronic properties.<br/><br/>Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon network, is unusual among two-dimensional electron systems. In part this is a consequence of the fact that its electronic properties are controlled by a Dirac equation. An analogy may be drawn with quantum electrodynamics, in which Coulomb interactions compete with the kinetic energy to determine the physical behavior of the system. The ratio of these energy scales suggests that Coulomb interactions are relatively strong in pristine graphene, with important consequences both at short and long length scales. The research will focus on the consequences of this physics when disorder, doping, and fluctuations are included, to understand under what circumstances the effects of Coulomb interactions might be observed. The PI will also examine nanostructured graphene systems, where behaviors with no analog in conventional two dimensional electron systems occur. These include the creation of new Dirac points via an external potential, and ""effective time-reversal symmetry breaking"" as observed in quantum rings. The remarkable insulating behavior of undoped graphene in the quantum Hall regime will also be examined. The PI aims to better understand the effects of disorder, how they affect the state of the system, their consequences for edge states, and to examine recent analogous behavior seen in bilayer graphene.<br/><br/>Quantum Hall bilayers near filling factor 1 display a counterflow resistance that appears to vanish in the zero temperature limit, and a strong but finite resonance in tunneling conductance. The underlying state that allows such unusual behavior to emerge remains poorly understood, but is likely to involve disorder in an intimate way. The PI will examine what happens when large collections of textured defects, merons, are induced by a periodic potential as a first step in examining how their presence affects the coherence of the system in a realistic disorder potential. The PI will also consider the transition from a coherent bilayer to uncorrelated layers as they are separated, for a clean system. The approach adopts the thin cylinder limit as a starting point, for which fluctuations may be handled in a more complete way than is possible for an infinite two-dimensional system.<br/><br/>Graphene is an important candidate for new device technologies. This research contributes to it understanding and may enable applications. Graduate students will participate in this research project; they will be trained in modern methods for analyzing condensed matter systems, preparing them for careers in science and technology. This research will be performed in collaboration with scientists from the US and abroad, strengthening and enriching our own physics community.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education into new electronic materials. Electronic materials play a crucial role in modern society, finding applications in computers, optics, telecommunications and more. As the demands for high speed and low power consumption increase over time, the need for new materials to meet these demands becomes ever-more more pressing. This project will explore the electronic physics of a new of class materials, possessing properties and behaviors with no analog in traditional semiconductors. A remarkable feature of some of these materials is that in an important sense their electrons behave as if they were moving at the speed of light leading to interesting phenomena.<br/>A paradigm for such systems is graphene, a two dimensional honeycomb network of carbon atoms with properties that make it attractive for device applications. The PI will use theoretical methods to study the basic electronic properties of graphene and to understand the similarities and differences between this system and its more conventional semiconductor cousins. The PI will also study how the electrons may organize themselves when the effects of interactions are taken into account. The possibility of observing new electronic states of matter which may have novel conduction and optical properties will be investigated. <br/><br/>The PI will also focus on effects of magnetic fields. A magnetic field can have many remarkable effects on the electronic properties of electrons confined to a plane, including measurable resistances that are fixed by the rules of quantum mechanics and fundamental constants that are independent of the properties of the material. Another striking effect occurs when two such planes are brought very close together: the electrons appear to organize themselves into a new state of matter that is reminiscent of superconductivity. Superconducting states display no resistance to the flow of electricity. The PI seeks to understand this new state of matter, how it arises, and how it differs from superconductivity."

The latter is expected to provide quantitative information of interest to physical practitioners in shock and detonation theory. A larger goal is to move beyond simple stability analysis to the study of nontrivial dynamics including bifurcation, interaction, and behavior of complex flows. The project involves interesting and nonstandard issues in singular perturbation theory, dynamical systems and bifurcation, spectral theory of linear operators, and nonlinear partial differential equations, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. The plan of attack centers around Evans function and related spectral techniques developed recently by the investigator and various collaborators.<br/><br/>The stability of regular flow patterns is an old and central topic in fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics, deciding which (stable) patterns will typically be observed, and which unstable) are only mathematical and not physically observable solutions. The transition from stability to instability is of particular importance, since it usually signals the appearance of alternative, more complicated flow patterns close to the original (now unstable) one- this is a way to understand complicated flows by the study of simpler and better-understood ones. Our goal is to move existing theory from the qualitative to the quantitative regime, obtaining new information of use to practitioners at the same time that we advance the mathematical theory. The planned activities expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across field, and to aid in training of graduate and postdoctoral students. The ultimate aim of these investigations, of quantitative predictions of transition to instability, would, if achieved, be of direct and practical use at the level of engineering, in chemical, manufacturing, and other processes."

This process, which is poorly understood but of global importance, is being examined using the freshwater, filamentous cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon (Tolypothrix PCC 7601). Previous research demonstrated that this organism appears to be using a novel form of gene regulation that involves multiple forms of a translation initiation factor called IF3. Many cyanobacteria appear to contain multiple IF3-encoding genes, making it likely that this form of regulation is widespread within this group. This project will confirm whether an IF3-mediated form of post-transcriptional control regulates the response of F. diplosiphon to the presence of green light during a process called complementary chromatic adaptation. If true, this will expand understanding of IF3 activity from its traditional role in translation initiation to also include the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental cues. This research will also further define the activity and function of a putative cyanobacterial phytochrome photoreceptor encoded within the F. diplosiphon genome whose expression, surprisingly, is regulated by another cyanobacterial phytochrome. Exploration of this novel arrangement will provide new insights into phytochrome signaling pathways in prokaryotes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This research will offer two Ph.D. and twelve undergraduate students training in the fields of signal transduction, molecular biology, microbiology and functional genomics. Based on the prior history of student training for this laboratory, a significant number of these students are likely to be from underrepresented groups. More broadly, because previous work on this project has also suggested that multiple forms of IF3 may regulate gene expression in the chloroplasts of higher plants during embryogenesis and senescence, this research may lead to improved agriculture practices and crop production.<br/><br/>This research is co-funded by the Divisions of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (Genes and Genome Systems) and Emerging Frontiers (Life in Transition)."

Briefly, a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is one that allows a third-party who has ciphertexts of several messages to construct---without knowing the decryption key---a new ciphertext that corresponds to an arbitrary efficiently computable function applied to the original messages. Fully homomorphic encryption has the potential to allow disparate organizations to compute basic functions on their pooled data-sets without revealing such data to each other. It is thus an ultimate solution for implementing ``need-to-know'' privacy.<br/><br/>Until Gentry's discovery, few researchers believed that FHE could be constructed. As a result, the concept has not been well-studied despite its clear potential to solve important tasks in a privacy-preserving manner. In particular, the basic relationship between FHE and traditional public-key cryptography remains unclear. The goals of this research project are to formalize this relationship, to build notions of FHE that satisfy stronger security guarantees such as security even when the adversary has access to a restricted decryption oracle, and to potentially use these stronger security guarantees to apply FHE in secure and privacy preserving computation.<br/><br/>To ensure the broader impact of the research, this project includes mentoring of students at all levels from undergraduate to post-doctoral and outreach activities to traditionally under-represented students and K-12 students. Research from this project will be disseminated through presentations and publications in conferences, journals and on the Internet."

While the community continues to make significant strides in high-performance computing, the ability to transfer the vast amounts of data generated by scientists has failed to increase commensurately. When scientists spend time dealing with data movement, or are limited by lack of timely access to data, the potential for scientific progress is hampered. Today, there are many application communities struggling with the well-known performance problems in TCP/IP in order to do the real work they need to do.<br/>This proposal would support the continued development and deployment of Phoebus, a protocol and service implementation for improving end-to-end transfers to gigabit speeds. Phoebus provides a network ""inlay"" that augments the network topology with an additional layer of protocol and functionality. Phoebus leverages the ubiquitous TCP/IPv4 implementation on the end hosts, while providing an adaptor to translate to a variety of alternate protocols over the wide area, including creation of virtual networks on the fly. Many data-intensive applications can use Phoebus without modification and without making any system-level changes.<br/>Phoebus makes use of a session-layer protocol called XSP, for eXtensible Session Protocol, for end-to-end communication and uses various transport layer protocol instances on different segments of the network, as appropriate. In many cases, performance can be improved by simply using existing protocols tuned based on network conditions and properties. Similarly, a high performance TCP alternative can be used when more assumptions about the underlying network can be made.<br/><br/>Phoebus is essentially a WAN accelerator for research and education networks. This project will work with various application communities to modify their software as necessary to make use of Phoebus and XSP. This will enable the creation of an automatically tuned data movement service, as well as the creation of appliances to act as ""on-ramps"" to dynamic circuit networks. Broader impact will therefore include significantly improved data transfer performance for scientific applications. Intellectual merit is found in the work's creative approach to adapting the concept of WAN acceleration to a multi-prototcol high bandwidth high delay environment."

However, a lack of knowledge about the protein machineries and cellular mechanisms of growth makes it nearly impossible to engineer crop plants for optimal growth and composition. In plants, the leaf epidermis is a mechanosensitive sheet that dictates the growth properties and architecture of the organ. The long-range goal of this research is to understand how protein complexes and cellular polymers coordinate epidermal growth. Direct knowledge about the cellular mechanisms of information flow and growth will drive future crop improvement strategies. The goal for this project is to determine how an evolutionarily conserved signaling protein termed SPIKE1 coordinates the production, delivery, and assembly of raw materials during growth. The Szymanski and Stahelin laboratories will test their central hypothesis that SPIKE1 membrane-binding and small GTPase activation at specific domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) coordinates cargo export and growth. They will pursue three research objectives.<br/>Objective #1 is to determine how SPK1-dependent small GTPase activation and its localization to subdomains of the ER relate to vesicle trafficking and cell morphogenesis. Their working hypothesis is that SPK1 GEF activity promotes ER exit site assembly and efficient protein recycling between the ER and the Golgi. <br/>Objective #2 is to discover the cellular mechanisms by which SPK1 is restricted to a punctate distribution on the surface of the ER. Their working hypothesis is that SPK1 binding to phosphatidylserine is sensitive to membrane fluidity and mediates ER localization in living cells. <br/>Objective #3 is to learn if conserved Golgi-localized protein complexes are intermediaries in a SPIKE1 cell shape control pathway. Our working hypothesis is that SPIKE1 promotes small GTPase activation of Golgi-localized protein complexes that regulate cargo trafficking. <br/>Their preliminary data indicate that SPIKE1 signals promote the formation of, and arise from specialized domains of the ER. These ER exit sites are commonly known as the entry point for anterograde protein trafficking in the secretory pathway. This research is expected to define a new importance for an ER domain that includes small GTPase signaling and the integration of intracellular growth control systems. Given the conserved nature of SPIKE-like proteins and their signaling targets, this research is likely to have a broad impact on the cell morphogenesis field.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Our research explores challenging new areas of plant cell biology and aims to provide the knowledge base that will enable the engineering of improved crops. The project is interdisciplinary and closely integrates research and learning activities. For example, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students at Purdue and Notre Dame will develop and supervise undergraduate research projects. Undergraduate researchers will learn scientific writing and will present their work at both local and national scientific meetings. Team learning and problem solving are central to the research plan. The research projects include cross-disciplinary research between the Stahelin and Szymanski labs. Research discoveries will be discussed in bi-monthly face-to-face meetings that are held in concert with the Chicago cytoskeleton meetings. The graduate students and post-docs will receive broad training that includes proper data management, effective oral presentations, and scientific writing. The research activities from this project will be published in high profile journals, incorporated into the a graduate plant cell biology course, featured in web-based news releases, and will be featured in a new web resource on SPIKE-like signaling proteins. As done in the past, new mutant strains will be donated to the ABRC stock center. The project will also generate vectors and strains associated with organelle-specific phospholipid modification that will be broadly used by the plant cell biology community."

Equivalent temperature is a metric that considers the total energy content of near-surface air by accounting for both the dry (sensible heat) and moist (latent heat) components. It therefore aligns well with human heat stress, which increases when temperature and humidity are simultaneously elevated. Because equivalent temperature is sensitive to changes in both temperature and humidity, variations in equivalent temperature can reflect processing occurring across a range of scales from global to regional. The objective of this project is to diagnose and attribute historical changes in equivalent temperature to processes occurring at the regional scale (e.g. changes in humidity resulting from soil moisture anomalies), the synoptic scale (e.g. changes in temperature and humidity associated with changes in the atmospheric circulation), and the global scale (e.g. changes in temperature and humidity associated with changes in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases). The project will investigate these processes within coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation models and regional climate models in the context of developing 21st-century equivalent temperature projections.<br/><br/>This project will address research needs identified in the National Climate Assessment process: to better understand atmospheric responses to atmospheric composition change and to improve understanding of atmospheric changes that may threaten human health and well-being. Equivalent temperature variability has not been previously considered in terms of multiple scales of influence. Attributing variations in equivalent temperature to the underlying processes across the spatial scales at which they act will allow exploration of mechanistic understanding of equivalent temperature tendencies in the historical record. Downscaling atmosphere ocean general circulation models using statistical and dynamical approaches with knowledge of the driving processes will allow the researchers to develop the best available projections of future equivalent temperature output and to contextualize those projections within a rigorous understanding of drivers of historical change. The results of the project will have broad implications for climate change adaptation and planning, because changes in equivalent temperature and its components may be critical for both human health and agriculture this century. Project results will be institutionally archived and made available to the research community. The project provides support for multiple graduate students at each institution, and thus contributes to development of the next generation of geographers and atmospheric scientists."

Even relatively simple animals exhibit a remarkable combination of flexibility and robustness to their behavior that would be extremely useful to the design of artificial systems. How do animals achieve this difficult balance? <br/><br/>Understanding how animals operate as integrated wholes requires building brain-body-environment models of complete animals. This in turn requires an animal system for which detailed behavioral, biomechanical, and neuronal information is available. In this regard, knowledge of the behavior, anatomy, genetics, development and neural connectivity of the nematode worm C. elegans is perhaps the most complete of any animal, with significant progress now also being made on the electrophysiology of its nervous system. Success also requires a modeling methodology that can work cooperatively with experimental methods throughout the project lifecycle and that can provide a theoretical framework for interpreting the integrated functioning of the system. <br/><br/>In order to demonstrate the feasibility of whole-animal modeling, this proposal describes a project to construct and analyze an integrated brain-body-environment model of C. elegans klinotaxis, a form of salt chemotaxis in which changes in direction are oriented towards the source through gradual continual adjustments. The approach described here combines connectome data-mining and a novel bracketing methodology, parameter optimization and clustering techniques for working with populations of models, and dynamical and information-theoretic analysis of representative motifs with behavioral manipulations, neuronal ablation and photo-stimulation, and electrophysiological studies on the biological system by an experimental colleague."

A new hypothesis, supported by recent multielectrode recordings in brain tissue samples and in the intact brain, suggests that local cortical networks self-organize to operate near a critical point. At this point, interactions across all spatial and temporal scales can occur, and avalanches of neural activity are generated at all sizes, resulting in approximately power law distributions. Very generic neural network models suggest that information processing will be optimal at this point. This ""criticality hypothesis"" has significant implications for computation in cortical circuits, and ultimately, for human health. Despite the potential importance of this hypothesis, it has remained untested in local cortical networks consisting of 100 or more synaptically connected neurons. Previous work has relied on local field potential recordings, which do not reveal the number or location of individual neurons generating signals. Previous work also has relied on relatively few (~60-100) broadly-spaced recording sites, which are insufficient to adequately sample a population of synaptically connected neurons. Here, the PI will record from 512 closely spaced electrodes, allowing us to monitor the spiking behavior of hundreds of neurons, many of which are expected to share synaptic connections. The tests the PI will perform of the criticality hypothesis will allow him, for the first time, to determine if networks of cortical neurons are critical or not. <br/><br/>Scientific education and outreach is another vital component of this proposal. The PI will engage thousands of children from economically disadvantaged areas in the development and use of an interactive exhibit for WonderLab, a popular local science museum for K-middle school children. This exhibit is based on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and will display children's brain waves, allowing them to modify these waves by biofeedback. This exhibit will be placed in WonderLab museum, which serves 78,000 visitors each year. WonderLab has been named by Parent's magazine as one of the ""Top 25 Science Centers in the United States."""

It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry). <br/><br/>This award supports research activities that will develop a versatile modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the unique functioning, critical stressors, and vulnerability of the world?s deltas. Deltas are economically and environmentally important systems, sustaining a large portion of the world?s populations, economic activity, and ecosystems. These systems are deteriorating rapidly due to climate changes, catchment changes, and local exploitation and ecosystem degradation. This project will develop an evidence-based framework for global delta sustainability by (1) advancing delta sustainability science as critical coupled human-natural systems; (2) co-design, -develop, and -deliver an evidence-based sustainability framework for risk assessment and decision support; (3) build an international repository of integrated delta datasets; and (4) develop and implement a modeling and decision support framework in partnership with local stakeholders. Applicable from local to national levels, this framework will be applied to three case-studies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong, and Amazon deltas. This project will contribute toward effective regional delta management and governance by providing a mechanism to integrate social, economic, bio-physical, and ecosystem services components to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management strategies and decisions across scales, in collaboration with experts and stakeholders."

Many scientists are turning to web portals or science gateways to allow them to analyze, share, and understand large volumes of data more effectively. The existence of science gateways - and the sophisticated cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools and resources behind these accessible web interfaces - can significantly improve the productivity of researchers facing the most difficult challenges. Most important, science gateways can democratize access to the cyberinfrastructure that enables cutting edge science. Now the best minds can tackle today¹s most challenging science problems, regardless of their affiliation.<br/><br/>Science gateway developers face several challenges. They often work in isolation even though development can be quite similar across domain areas, they bridge local, campus, national and sometimes international cyberinfrastructure, they need foundational building blocks so they can focus on higher-level grand-challenge functionality. Sustainable funding for science gateways can also be difficult to secure as they span the worlds of research and infrastructure.<br/><br/>This one-year planning award will gather community feedback, forming the foundation of a Science Gateway Institute. The institute will be an incubator of sorts for science gateways, vastly increasing their chances for long term success. It will provide a forum for developers to share ideas, approaches and software. It will provide expertise - in science gateway building, in technologies enabling grand challenge research, in open community software development, in virtual organizations, in project management and in science gateway sustainability. It will provide workforce development, training the next generation for careers in this dynamic, cross-disciplinary and important area."

The quality of life of these patients depends on longer-term exercise-based rehabilitation and support from the above groups. While frequent repetition of these exercises is critical to recovery, data indicates that compliance is very low. The proposed project seeks to increase compliance by increasing motivation through individual and multiplayer gaming, providing guidance and feedback, and enabling the therapist to monitor progress. Researchers use a combination of motion tracking technology, video games, and therapist oversight to accomplish increased compliance. The platform has three key components: <br/>1. A set of computer games prescribed to patients by therapists; <br/>2. A therapist portal to allow therapists to evaluate the patient, provide feedback and instructions, and coordinate with other providers in the course of treatment; <br/>3. An evidence-based knowledgebase for the analysis of therapy outcomes for various types of patients, conditions, and therapy regimes. <br/><br/>Two major shifts define the current trend in rehabilitation: The first is the shift toward evidence-based medicine. The second is the shift in rehabilitation from neuro-development, which emphasizes accurate performance of prescribed movements, to neuroplasticity, which emphasizes repetition and frequency. From a neuroplasticity perspective, the more repetitions of a movement, the stronger the identification fabric becomes as neurons rebuild their connections. The proposed project leverages current technology (motion tracking, gaming, cloud services, and data analytics) to enable both of these shifts in therapy. It involves patentable innovations in three key areas of patient-centered workflow development tools, collaborative stroke rehabilitation processes, and evidence-based therapy using data analytics techniques."

The present project focuses on the interplay of the two non-axonemal or cytoplasmic dyneins-1 and -2 in cilia formation. Because of the essential roles of cilia/flagella, intraflagellar transport (IFT) has evolved to ensure the proper assembly of these organelles. The ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila is an excellent system in which to study IFT, and promises to yield new insights into IFT and cytoplasmic dyneins. In contrast to what has been observed in other systems, the knockout of dynein-2 components in Tetrahymena results in only a mild reduction in the number and length of cilia. In these knockout cells, the dynein-2 is catalytically inert, but there is evidence that the Dyh2 tail domain continues to be expressed. Thus, either Tetrahymena does not require IFT to form functioning cilia, or Tetrahymena IFT can be powered by alternative motors other than dynein-2. An intriguing possibility is that the remaining Dyh2 tail domain can recruit other motors to substitute for the missing Dyh2 catalytic domain. Further, here is the opportunity to visualize both cytoplasmic dyneins in the same cell undergoing different processes, thus providing insights about the spatial coordination of the two dyneins. Combinations of genetics, immunochemistry, and fluorescence microscopy will be used to determine how the intracellular location and the level of expression of one cytoplasmic dynein is affected by the depletion of the other cytoplasmic dynein. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. <br/> The project focuses on the function of a protein motor in the regulation of cilia formation in a model organism. In a wide spectrum of organisms, cilia/flagella play essential roles, including the coordinated movements of fluids across a tissue surface, the movement of gametes, and the establishment of the left-right axis in embryos. In Tetrahymena, active cilia are required for cell motility, feeding, and cell division. A central objective of this RUI project is to integrate research into education while enabling undergraduate students to engage in complex, open-ended experiments that provide each student the opportunity to employ strategies in molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, and serology. Since 2003 at Harvey Mudd College, the laboratory has mentored 32 students who were from 7 different academic majors. Of the 21 who have now graduated, ten are in graduate school. To date, undergraduates have co-authored two peer-reviewed papers and three abstracts presented at national meetings."

While concrete content appears to facilitate the learning of specific pieces of information, previous research has shown that it may impair students' ability to apply that information to new situations. The proposed studies explore the relation between the superficial, concrete details through which a phenomenon is presented, and the abstraction of deeper scientific principles underlying the phenomenon. The specific content to be learned concerns the principles of complex systems in a range of STEM domains such as civil engineering, biology, economics, and mechanics. <br/><br/>The research methods involve classroom-based and laboratory experiments incorporating computer simulations of scientific principles. By observing how interaction with one simulation affects students' understanding of subsequently presented information, the investigators can assess the degree to which the underlying scientific principle has been successfully abstracted. The proposed research is divided into two broad lines. First, the investigators explore the role of comparison of multiple cases in students' ability to acquire generalizable principles from concrete examples. Second, they examine the degree to which physically and spatially plausible mechanical systems may serve as models for understanding complex or unintuitive causal systems. In both lines, the investigators explore the ways in which learning is affected by factors such as the degree and type of concrete detail depicted, the relative overlap of concrete and structural information between cases, and the concrete and structural variability with the test cases. Studies will include students in 8th grade science classes."

Specifically, this project supports the development of CUDA (parallel coding model from NVIDIA)-based code modules and OpenMP threading that can be used with the MILC [Multiple Instruction (and Multiple Data) Lattice Calculation] code. This 200,000-line code suite is used by several research groups around the world and supports some 100 million core-hours of computing at NSF and DOE national centers and laboratories mostly on conventional supercomputers. Our code development will allow improved performance on GPU clusters and on computers such as Blue Waters at NCSA that contain both GPUs and conventional multicore processors. Performance models developed will guide the performance tuning and help to plan future calculations and should also be of value in studing the effectiveness of exascale architectures. <br/><br/>Interpretation of many of the experimental results in particle physics is currently limited by lack of theoretical understanding. This reduces our ability to determine parameters of the Standard Model and to find evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model through precision experiments. The calculations that are enabled are thus important for the interpretation of many experiments in elementary particle physics. Some of these experiments at Fermilab, Cornell, and at SLAC have been completed. Others such as in Beijing, Geneva, and Japan are still running. <br/><br/>We have publicized previous work on code development and performance modeling by presentations at appropriate conference and publication. We will continue to do so for the current work in order that others can benefit from our methodology and innovations. The MILC code is widely used in benchmarking by several high-performance computing centers. This in turn has led to several vendors contacting us regarding performance of our code on their current and future chips. Thus, having GPU-accelerated code available in MILC could help in the evaluation of or co-design of future high-performance computing architectures. <br/><br/>Finally this project will contribute to the professional education and training of future scientists via the participation of postdoctoral reseachers."

Our approach is to jointly develop kinematic and dynamic models of lithosphere deformation in the western US to address a series of long-standing problems about how the lithosphere deforms including: 1. What is the mode of deformation in the western US? 2. What is the relative influence of various driving forces on lithosphere deformation? 3.

To what extent do faults interact mechanically by transfer of loads through elastic and viscous processes in the lithosphere?<br/><br/>We are developing kinematic models of long-term and interseismic deformation that will be used to infer the viscosity structure of the lithosphere, fault slip rates, distribution of interseismic fault creep, and lithospheric block motions. To do this we are constructing 3D earthquake cycle models consisting of faults in an elastic schizosphere overlying a layered viscous plastosphere. We are examining the extent in space and time to which postseismic relaxation processes in the mantle and on deep crustal faults might be evident in GPS measurements of interseismic deformation and to what extent these processes influence our estimates of fault slip rates. We are also moving beyond purely kinematic models and developing thin-plate elasto-plastic models of long-term lithosphere deformation in which faults slide in response to far-field plate driving forces, internal body forces due to variations in gravitational potential energy, and basal tractions. Combining these predictions of long-term motions with our interseismic deformation models and GPS observations, we are trying to infer the relative contributions of the various driving forces to lithosphere deformation."

This requires the development of new and increasingly more sophisticated ways of mathematically describing these systems and improvements in software and user interfaces that will dramatically enhance our ability to simulate these systems to improve the accuracy and reliability of model predictions of weather, floods, droughts, and climate variability. Such improved models will allow researchers to make better use of available data across disciplines and improve theory and algorithms that are essential to understanding Earth system behavior. Unfortunately, at present there is significant overhead of time and effort needed for discovering, accessing, understanding, and preparing data required to populate these models, as well as long learning lead times on how to use presently available models, owing to their complexity. This research overcomes some of these limitations by developing an innovative open modeling framework that can integrate data and models easily and is easy to use so that not only the research community and operational professionals can use it, but also policy makers and other interested parties. This EAGER award allows the construction of a prototype open meta-modeling framework that significantly reduces the time and effort on the part of users in the preparatory work for data and model comparisons, model testing and validations, for making fundamental knowledge discoveries in surface and ground water hydrological systems. In this framework, components/modules interact via user-configured open interfaces that allow the addition and integration of hydrological models and data sources using a common meta-level architecture and scientific workflows. The proposed prototype is based on a recently completed modeling framework, HS-NWSRFS (Hydro-information System for improving the National Weather Service River Forecast System). It represents a collaboration between investigators from three institutions, NASA, and NWS Ohio River Forecast Center (OHRFC). The funded effort will significantly expand the present code into an open community framework prototype.

Studies of sickness behaviors in seasonally breeding species have shown that the magnitude of an animal's response to infection varies across seasons. Seasonal modulation of sickness behaviors may be a mechanism to avoid over-expending energy or missing a reproductive opportunity, but suppressing the expression of these behaviors may put an organism at greater risk of not being able to clear an infection. Therefore, the degree to which an organism expresses sickness will have profound effects on its survival and reproductive success. When comparing across studies, a clear pattern emerges in that sickness behaviors are attenuated in the season in which an animal has the lowest energy reserves; however, the causative nature of this relationship has not been tested experimentally. The project's working hypothesis is that seasonal variation in sickness behaviors is due to seasonal variation in energy stores. The specific aims of the research are to: 1) determine the contributions of seasonal changes in food availability on sickness behaviors, 2) determine how metabolic hormones influence variation in sickness behaviors, and 3) evaluate the contributions of experimental manipulations of food availability and metabolic hormones on endocrine and immunological factors that directly mediate sickness behavior in seasonally breeding Siberian hamsters. An understanding of the physiological signals that act to modulate the display of sickness behaviors will enhance our knowledge of how environmental conditions affect how an animal responds to an infection. The results of this research will contribute to the current initiatives to understand disease susceptibility as a function of pathogen prevalence (i.e., disease ecology) and host immune function (i.e., ecoimmunology).

When light interacts with semiconductors or insulators and excites an electron from an occupied quantum state to an unoccupied one leaving behind an effective positive charge called the ""hole"", the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged hole results in the formation of a bound state of these two entities called the ""exciton"". Due to quantum mechanical laws, it is possible for excitons to condense into the same lowest-energy state or form a liquid-like state in which they can flow without any viscosity, thereby forming ""excitonic condensates"". While such condensates are technologically important because they make zero-resistance electronic transport and coherent sources of light possible, progress towards their realization has been has been hampered due to materials whose properties are not widely tunable. Recently, a two-dimensional honeycomb network of carbon atoms, called graphene, has emerged as an exceptionally versatile, clean, and tunable electronic material. It is believed that graphene is a promising candidate for the realization of excitonic condensates. <br/><br/>The PI will investigate the possibilities of excitonic condensation in a system of two layers of graphene stacked on top of another under various circumstances, and predict their signatures in electrical transport and light-emission measurements. The research will also address fundamental questions about excitonic condensates, and the results are expected to be applicable to a wide variety of systems. <br/><br/>The educational and outreach component of the proposal involves the training and mentoring of a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, as well as undergraduate and high school students. The PI will involve high school and undergraduate students in research and scholarly activities that emphasize the duality between textbook learning and research. The research will be translated into self-contained pedagogical modules that can be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum. The hands-on research experience for K-12 students will be complemented with periodic dissemination of exciting discoveries in science through a website and school-visits."

The PIs propose a theoretical and field study of how sediment load and type,and thus source terrain, control a delta?s planform morphology and internal stratigraphy. A series of numerical experiments using Delft3D, a morphodynamic physics-based model simulating 3D fluid flow and sediment transport, will extend the parameter space of earlier work by varying sediment fluxes and grain size distributions of a parent river subject to one flood wave per year.<br/>A final set of experiments will include the effects of wave and tides.

Light-dependent chloroplast movements are observed in most green plants. These chloroplast movements serve as a rapid mechanism for fine-tuning photosynthetic productivity in response to changes in light intensity. For example, movement of chloroplasts to the upper and lower surfaces of leaf cells in dim light can improve light capture, whereas chloroplast movement to the sides of cells when the light intensity is high can protect them from photodamage. The project is focused on the function of several novel genes that this investigator recently identified as essential for the chloroplast movements to occur. Genetic, molecular and physiological approaches are being used to understand the molecular mechanism of chloroplast movements. The research is expected to elucidate details of the motility mechanisms responsible for chloroplast movement and provide new insight into the nature of the light signal transduction pathway involved.

Such representations are parametrized by the identity fiber of the word map associated to a given relation, and I propose further to study the geometry of such word maps more broadly, with applications to group theory.

This EAGER project is an experimental project designed to evaluate whether genetic variation at specific loci contribute to hormonal variation in circumpolar ancestral (Central Asian) and descendant (indigenous South American) populations. The researchers expect this project to provide 1) validated field, laboratory and statistical approaches to hormone concentrations in women, and 2) valuable and novel data for the anticipated future study of circumpolar populations. In addition, the PI will be actively involved in community outreach in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in order to inform indigenous communities of the findings from the EAGER research and solicit community interest and collaboration in a broader circumpolar study.

It is difficult to use cloud computing resources for large-scale, high throughput ensemble jobs however. Additionally, the computationally oriented researcher is increasingly encouraged to make data sets available to the broader community. For the latter to be achieved, using capture tools during experimentation to harvest metadata and provenance reduces the manual burden of marking up results. Better automatic capture of metadata and provenance is the only means by which sharing of scientific data can scale to meet the burgeoning explosion of data.<br/><br/>This project develops a pipeline framework for running ensemble simulations on the cloud; the framework has two key components: ensemble deployment and metadata harvest. Regarding the former, on commercial cloud platforms typically a much smaller number of jobs than desired can be started at any one time. An ensemble run will need to be pipelined to a cloud resource, that is, executed in well-controlled batches over a period of time. We will use platform features of Azure, and employ machine learning techniques to continuously refine the pipeline submission strategy and workflow strategies for ensemble parameter specification, pipelined deployment, and metadata capture. Regarding the latter key component, we expect to reduce the burden of sharing scientific datasets resulting from the use of cloud resources through automatic metadata and provenance capture and representation that aligns the metadata with emerging best practices in data sharing and discovery. Ensemble simulations result in complex data sets, whose reuse could be increased by expressive, granule and collection level metadata, including the lineage of the resulting products, to contribute towards trust.<br/><br/>In this project we focus on a compelling and timely application from climate research: One of the more immediate and dangerous impacts of climate change could be a change in the strength of storms that form over the oceans. In addition, as sea level rises due to global warming and melting of the polar ice caps, coastal communities will become increasingly vulnerable to storm surge. There have already been indications that even modest changes in ocean surface temperature can have a disproportionate effect on hurricane strength and the damage inflicted by these storms. In an effort to understand these impacts, modelers turn to predictions generated by hydrodynamic coastal ocean models such as the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The proposed research advances the knowledge and understanding of probabilistic storm surge products by enhancements to the SLOSH model itself and through mechanisms that take advantage of commercial cloud resources. This knowledge is expected to have application in research, the classroom, and in operational settings.<br/><br/>The broader significance of the project is several-fold. Cloud computing is an important economic driver but it remains difficult for use in computationally driven scientific research. This project lowers the barriers to conducting e-Science research that utilizes cloud resources, specifically Azure. It will contribute tools to help researchers share, preserve, and publicize the scientific data sets that result from their research. Because we focus on and improve an application that predicts storm surge in response to sea level changes and severe storms, our work contributes to societal responses and adaptations to climate change, including planning and building the sustainable, hazard-resilient coastal communities of the future."

Instead, they turned to the idea of using tool boxes of heuristics to explain myriad decision bias and errors. The project will further develop a new theoretical application of quantum probability theory (the mathematical foundation of quantum theory) to human judgment and decision making. Quantum probability theory fundamentally differs from classical probability theory. The critical question is which set of probability rules provides a better description of human judgment and decision. In the Principal Investigators' past several years of research supported by NSF, they have shown that quantum probability theory provides an innovative, coherent, and mathematically principled approach to account for many paradoxical findings in judgment and decision research (i.e., conjunction and disjunction errors, interference effects, question order effects). The current project will further develop and test a consistent quantum probability account of violations of classic probability rules found in question order effects. The investigators will extend the quantum model for order effects to make a priori predictions about the direction of order effects and also to be able to account for measures with multiple ordinal levels. <br/><br/>The broad and long term goal of this research program is to break new ground and pioneer a new path by building probabilistic and dynamic systems for social and behavioral sciences from quantum rather than classical probability principles. This project will study whether it matters in what order questions are asked on a survey. The investigators regularly organize workshops on quantum probability models of cognition at annual meetings of Cognitive Science Society and Society for Mathematical Psychology. They have organized two special journal issues on the topic: one appeared in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology (2009) and the other is forthcoming in Topics in Cognitive Science. Their work has been cited across disciplines, ranging from cognitive science, decision science, economics, engineering, to mathematics, physics, and astronomy."

Currently middle school mathematics instruction in a single classroom is often not differentiated for different thinkers, which can bore some students or overly challenge others. One way schools often deal with different thinkers at the same grade level is by tracking, which has also been shown to have deleterious effects on students, both cognitively and affectively. In addition, students continue to struggle to learn algebra, and increasing numbers of middle school students are receiving algebra instruction. The proposed project initiates new research and an integrated education plan to address these problems by investigating (1) how to effectively differentiate instruction for middle school students at different reasoning levels; and (2) how to foster middle school students' algebraic reasoning and rational number knowledge in mutually supportive ways. Educational goals of the project are to enhance the abilities of prospective and practicing teachers to teach cognitively diverse students, to improve doctoral students' understanding of relationships between students' learning and teachers' practice, and to form a community of mathematics teachers committed to on-going professional learning about how to differentiate instruction.<br/><br/>Three research-based products are being developed: two learning trajectories, materials for differentiating instruction developed collaboratively with teachers, and a written assessment to evaluate students' levels of reasoning. The first trajectory, elaborated for students at each of three levels of reasoning, focuses on developing algebraic expressions and solving basic equations that involve rational numbers; the second learning trajectory, also elaborated for students at each of three levels of reasoning, focuses on co-variational reasoning in linear contexts. In addition, the project investigates how students' classroom experience is influenced by differentiated instruction, which will allow for comparisons with research findings on student experiences in tracked classrooms. Above all, the project enhances middle school mathematics teachers' abilities to serve cognitively diverse students. This aspect of the project has the potential to decrease opportunity gaps. Finally, the project generates an understanding of the kinds of support needed to help prospective and practicing teachers learn to differentiate instruction.<br/><br/>The project advances discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by (a) integrating research into the teaching of middle school mathematics, (b) fostering the learning of all students by tailoring instruction to their cognitive needs, (c) partnering with practicing teachers to learn how to implement this kind of instruction, (d) improving the training of prospective mathematics teachers and graduate students in mathematics education, and (e) generating a community of mathematics teachers who engage in on-going learning to differentiate instruction. The project broadens participation by including students from underrepresented groups, particularly those with learning disabilities. Results from the project will be broadly disseminated via conference presentations; articles in diverse media outlets; and a project website that will make project products available, be a location for information about the project for the press and the public, and be a tool to foster teacher-to-teacher communication."

The current study will answer these questions empirically through the use of film narrations, written contextualized questionnaires, and surveys of language-learning experiences from 120 participants. <br/><br/>The goals of this research project are: (a) to provide a detailed analysis of the distribution and use of simple present forms, and a range of progressive constructions, for native and nonnative speakers of Spanish; (b) to document task variation for the forms under investigation through multiple methods of data collection; (c) to provide valuable data on L2 acquisition of the tense-aspect system in Spanish, which will have implications for theories of language learning; and lastly (d) to inform sociolinguistic and syntactic theory through detailed empirical documentation of patterns of use of present progressive and simple present verb forms in both Spanish and English. This project will also support the education and training of an early-career scientist."

Our preliminary study shows that most of such malvertising activities are missed by popular detection services such as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront. This points to a disturbing lack of understanding of such web malvertising activities, which renders existing countermeasures less effective, and an urgent need to study the features of this threat to better prepares us to defend against it. <br/><br/>The proposed research endeavors to gain a holistic, in-depth understanding about the scope and magnitude of malicious display, search and contextual advertising, features of their infrastructures and ad content, behavior of malicious ad-related parties, and economics of this underground business. Based upon such a understanding, we continue to develop novel infrastructure-aware technologies to detect these malicious activities, which include effective malvertising analysis techniques that capture malicious ads, advertisers and ad networks through web patrol, client-side defense that protects a user from stepping into exploit servers and publisher-side countermeasures that empower legitimate publishers and ad networks to shield their customers from such attacks.

Different tenses target different positions of the stem in assigning these melodic high tones, and some tonal rules will apply within verbs in some tenses, but not others. The goal of this project is to assess the usefulness of inter-varietal tonal evidence in positing historical reconstructions. In probing this question, the project will comprehensively describe and analyze the verbal and nominal tonology of six Kenyan varieties of the Luyia language group: Idakho, Isukha, Nyore, Kisa, Marama, and Tsotso. The verbal tonology will be probed through a questionnaire which varies features of the verbal form. A questionnaire asking speakers to pronounce many nouns in a variety of semantic and syntactic contexts will probe the nominal tonology. These questionnaires will produce a rich dataset that will allow for the historical reconstructions based on segmental evidence to be compared with those suggested by tonal evidence.<br/> <br/>The usefulness of tonal evidence in positing historical reconstructions will be further assessed through an investigation of the synchronic variation within the Idakho variety. The speech of approximately 36 speakers subdivided into 6 groups will be compared, with special attention paid to three indicators: (i) the number and type of tense distinctions speakers maintain, (ii) grammatical properties of the tonal melodies, and (iii) the phonetic aspects of tone production. The parameters dividing the six groups are: (i) hometown (three rural Idakho communities) and (ii) current residence (original hometown vs. Nairobi).<br/> <br/>The project will shed light on the susceptibility of tonal systems like those of the Luyia languages to change, especially in response to contact with other languages. Furthermore, language learners, language teachers, and NGO workers will gain access to hitherto unavailable dictionary materials, descriptions of noun and verb formation, and an audio archive containing native-speaker pronunciations of many words."

The REU objectives are to provide students with 1) significant field and laboratory training in archaeology, geoarchaeology, geochemistry and geophysics, including: excavation, remote sensing, hands-on use of instruments, modern laboratory analyses, and the assembly and dissemination of results, 2) an opportunity to build cohort and professional networks that will serve them throughout their careers, and 3) an opportunity to participate in a project of regional and historical significance. The project will be evaluated by formative and summative assessments. Long-term success will be measured with post-program mentoring and tracking of the professional engagement of REU alumni.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Angel Mounds is a National Historic Landmark that figured prominently in the late prehistoric socio-political and population dynamics of the Midwest. The site is the furthest upstream Mississippian town in the Ohio Valley and, like its sister sites Kincaid in the Black Bottom and Cahokia in the American Bottom, its settlement was a major socio-political and population reorganization for the area. Unlike these other sites, its chronology, developmental history, and place within the local settlement and ecological systems are less well understood. Using multidisciplinary methods and instruction, REU undergraduates will be trained to examine questions surrounding anthropogenic transformation of the landscape, environmental change during the Medieval Warm and Little Ice Age, and local and regional patterns of warfare and demography. Because most excavation at Angel Mounds occurred during the WPA-era, some gaps will also be filled via reanalysis of legacy collections curated at the GBL. In addition, targeted geophysical survey, solid-earth coring and selective new excavation will be used to contextualize and modernize the earlier, less rigorously collected data. Students undertake these investigations through directed research as part of the REU Site. The development and evolution of the site and region are examined through: 1) earthwork construction episodes, 2) paleoenvironmental reconstruction for region, 3) the timing and relationship of palisade construction, and 4) the excavation of detected ?neighborhoods? on site to determine their chronological association with settlement growth during the Medieval Warm and village abandonment during the Little Ice Age. From this perspective, the proposed project simultaneously addresses the landscape and built environment of Angel Mounds. The REU students participate in every phase of the project from research design and data collection to laboratory analyses, archival research, and interpretation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Archaeological research has evolved from the prototypical multiyear site exams to more targeted research projects with refined questions and multidisciplinary research teams that build upon the accumulated body of knowledge. The Angel Mounds REU creates such a research environment. Talented students from the natural and social sciences and institutions with limited STEM research opportunities are actively recruited and encouraged to apply to the program. Given the underrepresentation of Native Americans in archaeology, recruitment of students from descendant communities are actively pursued through extant, IUPUI-based relationships. With rotating on-site projects designed to answer specific questions and the reanalysis of extant collections, the Angel Mounds REU prepares students to conduct targeted projects that rely simultaneously on traditional and state of the art field and laboratory methods. Project participants are expected to present the results of their research projects at conferences, such as Midwest Archaeological Conference (MAC). Students will also publish their research reports in the Report of Investigations (GBL-ROI) series."

The proposed work will develop a general statistical framework for the analysis of population-genomic data. The general strategy is to derive and computationally validate a set of efficient estimators for population-genetic parameters at three levels: individual genomes; multiple individuals within populations; and multiple populations. Specific subprojects include the measurement of patterns of variation and covariation among nucleotide sites, levels of population subdivision, and the development of novel methods to facilitate genome assembly and the refinement of genetic maps. Considerable emphasis will be focused on the development of efficient estimation algorithms for use by the genomics research community.<br/><br/>These methods will be widely used in both applied and basic research. Special attention will be devoted to identifying optimal sampling strategies, including the tradeoffs between depth of sequence coverage per individual and numbers of individuals, and between length, number, and quality of reads. As a consequence, the resultant methods should enable investigators to harvest the maximum possible information from their existing data sets, while also promoting the future design strategies to maximize informational yield per unit sampling and sequencing effort. The software to be developed will be permanently housed and freely available at the National Center for Genome Analysis Support, and workshops will be held to assist the user community in the implementation of such tools.

Firstly, to investigate the geometry of certain rigid-analytic moduli spaces by analyzing the representations of p-adic groups furnished by the l-adic etale cohomology groups of these spaces. Secondly, we aim at understanding the representation theory of reductive p-adic groups by making use of Rigid-Analytic Geometry.<br/><br/>1) The first aspect concerns the moduli spaces of p-divisible groups and their covering spaces, as defined by M. Rapoport and Th. Zink.<br/>A conjecture of R. Kottwitz predicts that the cohomology groups in question realize local Langlands correspondences. We develop and extend methods to show that the l-adic cohomology realizes correspondences of Jacquet-Langlands type, at least on the level of characters. We treat in detail some cases in which the phenomenon of endoscopy plays a significant role.<br/><br/>2) The second aspect is about the theory of locally analytic representations of reductive p-adic groups. Here we aim at developing a localization theory which unifies simultaneously the localization theory of A. Beilinson and J. Bernstein for Lie algebra representations, and the localization theory of P. Schneider and U. Stuhler for smooth representations. The theory of Rigid-Analytic Spaces provides a framework to relate these two theories.<br/><br/>The project's main theme is that of symmetries, families of symmetries (i.e., groups), about relating different kinds of symmetries, and studying symmetries in terms of the geometry of spaces (and vice versa). This is a classic approach, but is done for a class of symmetries and spaces that, so far, have not been well understood. The projects aim at unifying and better understanding theories that have been considered as separate branches so far. This is the case for the so-called smooth representation theory, and the representation theory of Lie algebras. The results will also help to understand the geometry of moduli spaces which are defined by polynomial equations with integral coefficients, e.g., integral models of Shimura varieties, and as such, are expected to deepen our knowledge about these fundamental objects in Geometry and Number Theory."

This re-ignition phenomenon differs greatly from common electric spark or compression ignition events. Whether or not, and how quickly, re-ignition occurs depends on a complex interaction of physical and chemical processes occurring at different rates: puff vortex spinning, mixing and fuel molecule oxidation. Preliminary experiments show good agreement with gas motion predictions, but also indicate that re-ignition delay time depends on the fuel-air ratio in a way that is as yet unexplained. This project will use computational, experimental, and analytical approaches to investigate re-ignition by transient jets that mix residual or re-injected combustion gases and fresh mixtures, establish the re-ignition delay time for common gaseous fuels, and determine their sensitivities to key parameters. Computational models will be used to predict puff vortex dynamics and reacting mixture temperature in stationary and traversing jets. Experiments will verify vortex dynamics and measure re-ignition delay times for traversing and stationary jets through the use of pressure sensors, visualization, and optical diagnostics. A simplified mathematical model will then be developed to carefully disentangle the gas mixing and chemical processes, and more accurately predict re-ignition. Fuel oxidation theory validated in other types of combustion will be tested for applicability to jet re-ignition. Scientists at a company partnering in this project will not only guide the project itself, but also mentor a doctoral candidate in applying the research findings at the company.<br/><br/>Broad Impacts: This project will enable jet-ignited combustion approaches aimed at dramatic reductions in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in a wide range of power plants. The success of this project has the potential to transform many of the ways in which fuel has been consumed since the Industrial Revolution. It leads directly to novel combustion methods that create a pressure boost in aircraft and electric power generation engines. By retrofitting or redesigning power generation gas turbines and aircraft jet engines with pressure-boost combustors, the United States can save an estimated $10 billion dollars in fuel and 100 megatons of CO2 emissions each year. The project will help develop pressure-boost combustion technology using a device called a wave rotor combustor. This disruptive technology can also enable innovative medium- and small-scale power generators as well as more efficient hybrid vehicles and portable power units. Additionally, the project enables more reliable ignition in trucks and locomotives using internal combustion engines, allowing the substitution of less expensive, domestic gas fuels for diesel refined from imported petroleum. Transient jets from small pre-chambers can accomplish consistent ignition of natural gas while reducing nitrogen oxide emissions and avoiding diesel smoke. The results of this research will be immediately utilized in concurrent but separate wave rotor combustor experiments, with simplified models being incorporated into design codes usable by industry. The doctoral candidate will assist the industry partner in the development of a wave rotor combustor prototype, the initial goal of which is reducing fuel consumption, carbon emissions, and the weight of gas turbines by about 20% each."

The first is to give a systematic approach to topological equivariant rigidity, using tools from surgery theory, algebraic K-and L-theory, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture. The second is to study characteristics classes of matroid bundles (defined by Anderson and Davis) and to apply them to combinatorial incidence geometry. The third area is to investigate a rigidity conjecture involving self-homotopy equivalences of 3-manifolds and its connections with high-dimensional topology. The fourth area is to give the the classification, up to homeomorphism, of manifolds having the homotopy type of the total space of certain torus bundles over lens spaces. This is an application of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture. The fifth area is to compute the L-groups of a free product of groups, and thereby solve the connected sum problem - when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum. The last area is to study the algebraic and point-set topology of actions of p-groups on the torus from the point of view of homotopical group actions and Smith theory.<br/><br/>Geometric topology is the study of manifolds. An n-dimensional manifold is a set of points locally modeled on n-dimensional Euclidean space. For instance, a 2-manifold is a surface and looks like a plane near each point. Many physical phenomenon are represented by manifolds, and as such, understanding the global structure of a manifold, and what possible manifolds exist, is fundamental to the sciences, as well as to mathematics. Manifold theory connects with most areas of mathematics, as well as with physical phenomena such as cosmology, string theory, and classical and quantum mechanics. To understand and classify manifold one uses a variety of tools including algebraic topology, bundle theory, and differential geometry."

The proximate explanation for sex differences in phenotype is differences in gene expression, i.e., which genes are ?turned on or off? in males and females. But exactly how gender affects gene expression is an open question where much remains to be learned. Hormones such as testosterone are likely candidates for controlling differences in gene expression of genes in males and females. To date much of the research in this area has focused on experimental manipulation of hormones, rather than on the role of natural, individual variation in levels of circulating hormone. The research supported by this award asks two primary questions: (1) what genes and gene networks are affected by natural, individual variation in testosterone phenotype, and (2) how do males and females differ in affected genes and gene networks? The dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), a North-American songbird, will be the subject of study because of the recent development of genomic tools in this system and the wealth of historical data on its natural history, response to testosterone, and sex differences in behavior; all studied in a wild population. Successful completion of the aims of this project will enhance our understanding of the genes and gene networks that are related to natural variation in testosterone. The research proposed here will have broader impacts because it will provide unique opportunities for undergraduate research: the preliminary stages of this research have already led to undergraduate research opportunities for four individuals from underrepresented groups."

Particularly, software employs a discretized Gamma distribution and important statistical properties of that model, such as model identifiability and how many rate classes can be or need to be used, are unknown. We propose to determine the statistical properties of such models. Moreover, even the most sophisticated models fail to mimic many real data sets analyzed in phylogenetics: for instance, while the general time reversible model allows for arbitrary base frequencies, it requires that all the species under study have the same base frequencies as each other. The natural non-parametric alternative is the method of maximum parsimony which suffers from the phenomenon of long branch attraction: when data are generated under some model of genetic evolution on certain types of trees and then analyzed under parsimony methods, parsimony methods return an incorrect tree with some probability that does not tend to zero as the amount of data increases to infinity. Thus, it is often said that the method of maximum parsimony is not a consistent statistical method for phylogeny reconstruction. However, this criticism has the potential of applying to all phylogenetic reconstruction methods, including model-based methods, when the data are not generated under the model used to analyze them. We propose to determine the model conditions under which the natural non-parametric alternative, parsimony, is a consistent method for phylogenetic estimation. The goal of both projects is to provide solid mathematical foundation for phylogenetic reconstruction methods.<br/><br/>Phylogenies are trees describing the evolutionary relationships of species. Having an accurate description of these relationships can help researchers discover the genetic basis of human diseases and the reasons for varying pathogenicity of viruses and bacteria. This project aims to understand the mathematical properties of the statistical methods used to infer phylogenies from genetic data. These mathematical properties tell which methods are most appropriate for use on specific kinds of data and whether a method can be useful at all on any data. This information, in turn, will lead to more accurate phylogenies."

Extending this relationship to the Banach space of bounded functions from the reals into the low modes leads to a determining form, an evolution equation that is globally Lipschitz, and dissipative. The global attractor of the original differential equation is contained in the long time behavior of the determining form. This provides an alternative to the theory of inertial forms which is not known to be applicable to the Navier-Stokes equations. The other evolution equation is for the radius of analyticity in the spatial variable. We will use this equation to study the domain of analyticity for solutions on the global attractor and its effect on aspects of fluid flow such as intermittency.<br/><br/>Fluid motions at large scales, for instance in ocean and atmosphere, display erratic, seemingly incomprehensible (turbulent) features when viewed locally and for short times. However, over time, consistent global statistical patterns emerge. The purpose of this research is to develop a rigorous understanding of the nature and origin of such patterns, and of deviations from it, with a view towards diverse applications such as ocean modeling and weather forecasting. For instance, weather forecasting is done by solving a large system of equations which model the state of the atmosphere over a period of time.<br/>The current state of the atmosphere is needed as input in order to compute the state in the future. As there are always limited measurements of the state of the system, this input inevitably contains some error. The inherent sensitivity of the system to such an error means that as time goes on the computed solution diverges from reality. The technique of data assimilation uses the limited measurements of the system at not just a single moment of time, but rather over an extended time period in the past, to arrive at a more accurate input. This project applies recent mathematical discoveries to develop new variations on this technique. It will lead to new algorithms that will be implemented and tested by the research team. Graduate students will play an essential role in this collaborative effort, thus serving to train future generation of scientists in the STEM disciplines."

More specifically, using work of Fisher and Stephenson as its starting point, it studies how the total number of dimer coverings of the complement of the gaps changes as the gaps are moved around on the lattice graph. The joint correlation of a collection of gaps is a non-negative real number measuring this change, and is the central object of study of this proposal. In earlier work, the proposer proved that the correlation of gaps on the hexagonal lattice is governed, for large separations between the gaps, by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics: If each gap is regarded as a point charge of magnitude given by the signed difference between the number of white and black vertices in it (in a fixed white-black coloring of the vertices in which each edge has oppositely colored endpoints), then, for large distances between the gaps, their correlation is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the 2D electrostatic energy of the resulting system of charges. Other previous results concern two naturally defined fields, which the proposer proved approach the electric field in the limit when the lattice spacing approaches zero. In the current project, the proposer presents a program organized in several inter-related groups comprising twenty four specific problems and conjectures. The bulk of this program is aimed at developing further the analogy to phenomena from physics, but the list includes also independent combinatorial problems, such as conjectures on tiling enumeration of new regions and generalizations of classical results on plane partitions.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science, deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics. A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant in the study of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid consisting of diatomic molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (specifically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly turns out in fact to be more tractable, and allows progress in the asymptotic study."

Recent research in disease ecology has greatly improved our understanding of the behavior and dynamics of parasites and pathogens. While evidence shows some hosts become infected or transmit pathogens more than others, most theoretical models describing disease dynamics have ignored differences among individuals. Sources of individual variability such as sex, age, pathogen co-infection status, previous infection, and immune function influence how hosts become infected. Integrating population- and individual-level approaches can better describe how pathogens are affected by the small-scale environment of the host and the larger-scale community of hosts, vectors, and pathogens, leading to better assessment of disease risk and pathogen prevalence. This research addresses the following questions: 1) How does variation among individual hosts affect parasite load and probability of infection? 2) How does variation in the probability of host infection determine pathogen prevalence at the population and community level? To address these questions, ticks and small mammal hosts will be repeatedly sampled across the season of peak tick activity, and the co-infection status of hosts and ticks, as well as the host immune response, will be evaluated. Next-generation, high throughput sequencing will be used to analyze tick and host microbial co-infection patterns. A combination of a general, functional immune assay and detailed measurement of host cytokine profiles will be used to inform how the immune system interacts with vectors and vector-borne infection.<br/><br/>This project investigates many levels of diversity, from bacterial to vector, host, and environment, using techniques from multiple fields of biological science. The results of this research project may lead to better on the ground assessment of human risk for vector-borne disease. The interdisciplinary nature of this research provides many opportunities for undergraduate research projects, from animal behavior to vector and pathogen genetics, making this project exciting to a broad diversity of students. Educational literature on tick-borne disease and minimizing risk will be designed for local DNR, parks and recreation groups."

The failure of long-term forecasts to anticipate an<br/>event of this magnitude is leading to a reevaluation of our scienti c understanding of subduction<br/>zone fault dynamics. At the same time, the enormous Japanese investment in seismic and<br/>geodetic monitoring provides an unprecedented opportunity to study processes leading to giant<br/>earthquakes. The investigators will focus here on two aspects of the quake that raise central issues for our ability<br/>to forecast future hazards globally: 1) the constraints that geodetic strain accumulation place<br/>on the seismic moment budget, and 2) how the distribution of mechanical properties on the<br/>plate interface control seismic versus aseismic slip.<br/><br/>Forecasts of seismic hazard rely primarily on the historical record, paleoseismology, and<br/>geodetic strain accumulation. While a strict time-predictable model has proven inconsistent<br/>with geodetic data in some areas, the rate of strain accumulation must strongly in<br/>uence the recurrence rate and/or size of large earthquakes. Previous analyses of the extensive Japanese<br/>GPS data set regularize the underdetermined inverse problem; the inferred plate coupling is<br/>thus conditional on the choice of regularizing functional. In addition, most assumed no coupling at the trench, an area that effectively lies in the model null-space. The researchers propose rather to estimate rigorous bounds on the moment deficit rate, independent of any regularizing functional. They also propose to systematically explore the effects of time-dependent viscoelastic effects on estimates of slip deficit.<br/><br/>The Tohoku earthquake also raises profound questions about the frictional properties of<br/>the subducting plate interface. Mw > 7 events along the Japan-Kurile trench have repeated<br/>in nearly the same locations. Substantial afterslip following these events suggested that the<br/>fault surrounding these seismic `asperities' have different frictional properties, e.g., velocity<br/>weakening `asperities' surrounded by velocity strengthening regions. The fact that the March<br/>11 earthquake seems to have ruptured through both areas raises important questions. Is the<br/>asperity paradigm fundamentally flawed? Or did the M 9 activate other weakening mechanisms<br/>(thermal pressurization?) that allowed it to rupture through velocity strengthening regions?<br/><br/>To distinguish between competing hypotheses the researchers will use a combination of GPS data based<br/>hypothesis testing and physics based fault modeling. They will test whether or not post-seismic<br/>GPS data can be fit with afterslip only in regions that have not experienced seismic slip in<br/>the last several decades. They will test alternative physical models that could account<br/>for the observed behavior, by extending our numerical codes that couple rate-state friction,<br/>thermal pressurization, and dilatant strengthening to three dimensions. This will allow them to<br/>test for example whether dilatancy could stabilize slip in otherwise velocity weakening regions,<br/>or thermal pressurization could allow ruptures to extend into velocity strengthening areas."

Such maps have been studied for about twenty years, with specific examples playing a crucial role in the development of a more general theory. Based largely on these examples, there is a clear conjecture describing what one should expect from the ""most unstable"" part of the dynamics for these maps, i.e. the support of the measure of maximal entropy. Significant progress has been made and verification of the conjecture is almost complete for rational maps in two variables. The dynamics away from the support of this measure of maximal entropy is also of significant interest. In certain cases, there is a physically relevant invariant real slice that is away from the support of this measure. In other cases, one may be interested in the topology of the Fatou set, on which the dynamics of the map is stable. For these types of questions, we need new conjectures, which the PI believes will be best developed by studying appropriate examples. The PI proposes three different projects, each providing examples that can motivate a deeper theory of complex dynamics in several variables. They are: (1) study of rational maps arising as renormalization operators for the Ising model (a model for magnetic materials) on hierarchical lattices, (2) study of Fatou components for globally holomorphic maps of the complex projective plane, and (3) investigation of the first properties for a family of postcritically finite rational maps that have indeterminate points.<br/><br/>All three of the proposed projects will work out details for the dynamical behavior of specific rational maps in several variables. This will push the contemporary theory and also help to develop new conjectures. Moreover, the project related to the Ising model will help to build new connections between three fields (real-dynamics, complex dynamics, and statistical physics), while potentially leading to a deeper theoretical understanding of magnetic materials. There is significant potential for broader impact, particularly by fostering better communication between researchers in dynamical systems and mathematical physics. Work related to these projects can influence students of all levels, from very talented high school students (with whom the PI actively works) through Ph.D. candidates, by exposing them to contemporary research that crosses between disciplines."

The investigators hypothesize that differences in feeding rates create a causal chain of relationships that ultimately promotes the maintenance of diversity through basic ecological mechanisms. To test these ideas, the research combines monitoring of biodiversity and diseases in natural populations with laboratory experiments designed to disentangle genetic versus environmental factors shaping the traits of individuals. By determining how seemingly unrelated traits are integrated into distinct strategies, and examining how the frequency of different strategies varies along a natural ecological gradient, the research will provide novel insights into the ecological pressures maintaining phenotypic and genetic variation in natural populations. <br/><br/>Results from this study will significantly advance understanding of how diseases spread and how biodiversity is maintained.

The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which patterns in denitrification can be explained by the genetic structure of bacterial communities and the interactions between bacteria and other environmental factors, such as the chemistry of dissolved organic matter.

One introduced plant now abundant in Eastern deciduous forests, garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), is thought to release toxic chemicals that harm native plant species. Furthermore, garlic mustard has a longer growing season than most native forest plants, allowing it to take advantage of light during the fall, winter, and spring when natives are dormant. These mechanisms may reinforce one another if the extra light available to garlic mustard during its extended growing season is used to increase production of chemical toxins. This project will test this hypothesis by measuring the growth, chemical production, and impact of garlic mustard on native species in the presence and absence of extended light availability. Results will help to fill an important gap in our understanding of invasion biology by showing how interactions between mechanisms may increase the invasiveness of introduced species. <br/><br/>Invasive plant species threaten native biodiversity throughout the United States, and impose significant economic costs (approximately $137 billion/year).

Mainly this will be achieved by probabilistic thinking about questions that arise in other areas. In group theory, the PI will work on the question of whether every group is sofic. The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it. In graph theory, probabilistic thinking leads to new questions and results involving inequalities for finite graphs. Namely, one often finds when counting combinatorial objects that a subgraph contains fewer of them than the whole graph. But if the subgraph is based on fewer vertices, then one ought to normalize the counts to reflect this. The PI has some partial results in this direction and proposes to find more. In ergodic theory, questions involve graphings, colorings, and factors. In fact, it may be that these investigations will lead to progress in the theory of percolation on groups. Combining several of these areas are very natural processes that are related (by previous work of the PI) to algebraic invariants known as ell-2-Betti numbers. Therefore, they suggest ways of resolving an important open question about these Betti numbers.<br/><br/><br/>In the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs (networks) to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.

The PI proposes to continue work on this question.<br/>Inequalities are important in most areas of mathematics. The field of graph theory and combinatorics contains many inequalities, often of the form that certain graphs contain the most (or the fewest) possible objects of a certain type among all graphs in a given class. The PI will develop novel inequalities of this type, which are inspired by a probabilistic viewpoint.<br/>Topology is the study of the shape of things. One tool is to count the number of holes of various dimensions. But if the whole space of interest is infinite, then the number of holes is often either zero or infinity.

It is a superb example of igneous crystal accumulation with grain-size layering, inclined/cross layering and features of ""soft sediment"" deformation. Recent exploration work in the Complex has dispelled claims that Ural-Alaska intrusions are poor hosts for sulfide mineralization, ostensibly due to their oxidized nature. Previous work showed that contamination processes involving graphitic and sulfidic country rocks can lead to reduction of the magma and formation of immiscible sulfide melt. Sulfide saturation appears to have been reached when clinopyroxene was becoming a liquidus mineral - far too late to have permitted the formation of Ni-rich sulfides as Ni would have been sequestered by early-forming olivine. However, questions still remain regarding the accumulation of sulfide in the Complex and the possible importance of multiple stages of sulfide saturation. Although olivine in dunite at Duke Island may be characterized by ""normal"" Ni contents, examples of Ni-depleted olivine also exist; this suggests that the olivine interacted with, or crystallized in the presence of, sulfide liquid somewhere in the system. The presence of alternating layers of sulfide-bearing and sulfide-deficient olivine clinopyroxenite is also unexplained and may represent either multiple stages of sulfide saturation or involvement of distinct magmas. Sulfide layers are characterized by either euhedral clinopyroxene or granular olivine in a sulfide matrix, or by strongly embayed, amoeboid-type pyroxene and olivine with abundant spherical sulfide inclusions. New geophysical evidence suggests that the Duke Island Complex is part of a ""wine-glass"" shaped conduit, consistent with the premise that crystals and dense sulfide liquid accumulated in the widened portion of the conduit system. Detailed petrographic, electron microprobe, S-O-Os isotopic, and PGE analyses are proposed to investigate the nature of sulfide saturation in the conduit, and the accumulation of silicate crystals plus sulfide liquid. Results will not only increase understanding of conduit processes in convergent margin settings, and formation of sulfide mineralization in conduit settings in general.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposed research will introduce a graduate student and an undergraduate student to a variety of state-of-the-art analytical techniques. The work also will involve a collaborative effort between company geologists and academic scientists. This research is designed to increase our understanding of a type of sulfide mineral occurrence that has not been well-studied, and that at some point in the future will be important as our national and global need for raw materials increases. The United States has no primary producing Ni mines (although the Eagle deposit in Michigan is scheduled to initiate mining in 2010) at a time when the demand for stainless steel and other alloys is increasing.

This fault accommodated hundreds of km of displacement in the geologically recent past, about 30 million years ago. The hypothesis being tested is that of shear heating. It is possible that the rocks in the fault might be heated by the friction associated with these large displacements. If the rocks in this fault zone had been so heated, then they would become weak and less prone to earthquakes. This NSF project is funding field work to allow structural observations and sample collection in China, as well as laboratory work on samples to detect when the last heating event occurred. This project also involves collaboration with Taiwanese researchers, which adds significant international impact.<br/><br/>More specifically, the rocks in this fault zone are thought by some to have been metamorphosed by shear heating as the Indochina block was extruded past the Yangtze block during the Oligocene-Miocene collision of India with Asia. Some of the evidence for heating comes from the Oligocene to Miocene ages of thermochronometers, especially monazite, muscovite, and K-feldspar. With the interpretation that these ages are all cooling ages, it follows that the rocks experienced temperatures of > 700°C between 30 and 20 Ma, and cooled quickly after that. However, it is also possible that these ages may be crystallization ages, in which case the argument for shear heating becomes considerably weaker. We will characterize muscovite and K-feldspar to determine whether those minerals are magmatic or metamorphic. We will then date these minerals using the 40Ar/39Ar age spectrum method. If the results show any ages older than ~30 Ma, then the hypothesis of shear heating can be dismissed as a viable weakening mechanism, at least in these rocks."

The approach applies a series of algorithms that implement a form of three-dimensional, migration inversion. Three-component waveforms of body waves recorded by the TA are manipulated in a manner similar to seismic reflection processing to produce a three-dimensional image volume of P to S scattering strength beneath the continent. The method is being used to produce high-resolution images of the subducting lithosphere of the Juan de Fuca/Farallon system and to develop a 3D model of the geometry of that system. As the array moves eastward the method will be used to image lithospheric scale boundaries that can be applied to test models of how the Precambrian core of the continent was assembled. Technical problems being attacked to improve the capabilities of this new method are: (1) extension of the method to image S to P conversions, (2) new methods for estimating the impulse response of the medium (deconvolution), (3) improved handling of irregular data that are the norm for passive arrays, (4) improved error appraisal metrics, and (5) multiple removal. Broader impacts include support for a PhD student's research and plans to make 3D image volumes available via the web."

The organizers, members of the Diversity Committee of the Animal Behavior Society, will advertize, identify and select participants who are members of underrepresented groups, low income, first generation, and currently attending schools at which there are few opportunities for research. Ten students each year will be provided with funds to cover all travel, housing, and registration expenses. In addition to attending all meeting events, the students will participate in training activities designed to make sure they get the most out of the meetings. Each student will also be matched with mentors with whom they can interact during the meeting itself. In 2009, the ABS meetings will be hosted in Brazil, offering an important international experience for our students. Based on recent experience, we expect at least 60% of undergraduate award winners to be members of traditionally underrepresented minority groups. Moreover, in written surveys, almost 90% of students who participated in our program activities agreed that they were more likely to go into graduate research in science as a result of having attended the ABS meetings. More than 80% report having had informal interactions with scientists at the meetings who are likely to have an impact on their future careers. The program provides a unique opportunity for graduate training faculty to meet and interact closely with future doctoral students who are members of underrepresented groups."

Sunlight and nutrients affect the chemical composition of algae, including the amounts and ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus as well as essential fatty acids (EFAs). In addition, light and nutrients can determine which algal species are present, and their digestibility for herbivores. Variation in carbon:nutrient ratios, EFAs, and digestion resistance of algae can determine the production of herbivores, but little is known about how these effects propagate to animals at the top of the food chain, e.g., fish and other carnivores. <br/><br/>The investigators will conduct three large-scale experiments to investigate effects of light, nutrients, carnivore species, food web structure, and nutrient ratios on food chain efficiency. They will also develop next-generation, stoichiometrically-explicit computer models which will provide mechanistic understanding of the experimental results, and expand the scope of the research.<br/><br/>This project will provide critical information for decision-makers involved in water quality protection and fisheries management. For example, fisheries yields depend on food chain efficiency, specifically the proportion of algae production that is converted into fish or shellfish species harvested by humans; eutrophication results from the inefficient use of plant production by herbivores after excessive nutrient enrichment; carbon storage in deep waters and sediments (which reduces greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) is related to energy that is not consumed in pelagic food chains; and the concentrations of contaminants at each trophic level is affected by energy flow through food chains. In addition, many global-scale environmental problems, such as eutrophication and climate change, alter the supplies of light and nutrients, and can mediate food chain efficiency. In addition the project will provide numerous opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, who will be actively engaged in all aspects of the research."
