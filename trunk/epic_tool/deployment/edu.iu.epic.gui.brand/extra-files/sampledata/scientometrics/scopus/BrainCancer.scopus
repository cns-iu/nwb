SKCa channel modulation is associated with various brain, heart, and cancer diseases. N-methyl-laudanosine and its structurally related derivatives, substituted 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoliniums, are reversible and selective SKCa channel blockers. Carbon-11 labeled N-methyl-laudanosine and its tetrahydroisoquinolinium derivatives may serve as new probes for positron emission tomography (PET) to image SKCa channels in the brain, heart, and cancer. The key intermediates, substituted isoquinolines (3a-c), were synthesized using a modification of the Pomeranz-Fritsch procedure. The precursors, substituted 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (8a-c), and their corresponding reference standards, substituted 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoliniums (9a-c), were synthesized from compounds 3a-c with 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl chloride (2) in multiple steps with moderate to excellent chemical yields. The precursor 6,7-dimethoxy-1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (10) was commercially available, and the methylation of compound 10 with methyl iodide provided N-methyl-laudanosine (11). The target quaternary ammonium tracers, carbon-11 labeled 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoliniums ([11C]9a-c and [11C]11), were prepared by N-[11C]methylation of the tertiary amine precursors (8a-c and 10) with [11C]methyl triflate and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification using a SiO2 or cation-exchange CM Sep-Pak cartridge in 40-65% radiochemical yields. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, positron-emitter-labeled compounds derived from choline have the potential to serve as oncologic probes for positron emission tomography. The fluorine-18 (18F)-labeled choline derivative fluorocholine (FCH) in particular has demonstrated potential utility for imaging of a variety of neoplasms, including those of the breast, prostate, liver, and brain. The pharmacokinetics of FCH and other choline tracers allow for whole-body imaging within minutes of injection while still achieving high tumor-to-background contrast in most organs, including the brain. These features, along with the possibility of imaging malignancies that have proved elusive with the use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography support further clinical investigations of 18F-labeled choline tracers. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here we report that cesium chloride, an alternative medicine in treating radiological poison and cancer, has neuroprotective actions. Serum and potassium deprivation induced cerebellar granule neurons to undergo apoptosis, which correlated with the activation of caspase-3. Cesium prevented both the activation of caspase-3 and neuronal apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Cesium at 8 mM increased the survival of neurons from 45 ± 3% to 91 ± 5% of control. Cesium's neuroprotection was not mediated by PI3/Akt or MAPK signaling pathways, since it was unable to activate either Akt or MAPK by phosphorylation. In addition, specific inhibitors of PI3 kinase and MAP kinase did not block cesium's neuroprotective effects. On the other hand, cesium inactivated GSK3β by phosphorylation of serine-9 and GSK3β-specific inhibitor SB415286 prevented neuronal apoptosis. These data indicate that cesium's neuroprotection is likely via inactivating GSK3β. Furthermore, cesium also prevented H2O2-induced neuronal death (increased the survival of neurons from 72 ± 4% to 89 ± 3% of control). Given its relative safety and good penetration of the brain blood barrier, our findings support the potential therapeutic use of cesium in neurodegenerative diseases. © 2007 ISDN.","Apoptosis; Cesium; GSK3β; Lithium; Neuron",,,,,,"Ankarcrona, M., Dypbukt, J.M., Bonfoco, E., Zhivotovsky, B., Orrenius, S., Lipton, S.A., Nicotera, P., Glutamate-induced neuronal death: a succession of necrosis or apoptosis depending on mitochondrial function (1995) Neuron, 15, pp. 961-973; Barnham, K.J., Masters, C.L., Bush, A.I., Neurodegenerative diseases and oxidative stress (2004) Nat.

Central nervous system recurrence can terminate a complete remission in other chemosensitive tumors, such as small cell lung cancer, because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We propose to document that the BBB is also relevant in germ cell tumors despite their dramatic chemosensitivity. Methods and Materials: We present five cases illustrating the concept of the BBB in patients with metastatic testicular cancer treated with chemotherapy. Results: In our large series of patients with metastatic testicular cancer treated with chemotherapy, we identified 5 unique patients. These patients were rendered free of disease only to experience relapse in the brain alone. This included 1 patient who initially had good-risk metastatic disease by means of the International Germ Cell Collaborative Group staging system at the onset of chemotherapy.

RTOG 0119 was a phase II randomized trial for this group of patients. Methods and Materials: RTOG RPA Class 2 patients with brain metastases were randomized to 20 mg of melatonin, given either in the morning (8-9 am) or in the evening (8-9 pm). All patients received radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) in the afternoon. Melatonin was continued until neurologic deterioration or death. The primary endpoint was overall survival time. Neurologic deterioration, as reflected by the Mini-Mental Status Examination, was also measured. Results: Neither of the randomized groups had survival distributions that differed significantly from the historic controls of patients treated with whole-brain radiotherapy. The median survivals of the morning and evening melatonin treatments were 3.4 and 2.8 months, while the RTOG historical control survival was 4.1 months. Conclusions: High-dose melatonin did not show any beneficial effect in this group of patients. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Retrospective review. OBJECTIVE. To determine if rib anomalies are present in pediatric malignancies in the United States. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Scoliosis surgeons view radiographs of the entire spine, counting the number of ribs. A European study noted that rib anomalies were more common in certain malignancies. We wished to determine if this is also true in the United States. If so, the potential for screening, early detection of malignancy, and a better understanding of tumor biology is possible. METHODS. A retrospective review of 218 children with malignancy and a control group of 200 children with polytrauma or suspected child abuse was performed. Chest radiographs were reviewed to determine the number of ribs, and the presence of rib anomalies. 24 ribs was considered normal, <24 or >24 was considered abnormal. P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS. The average age was 6.8 ± 5.5 years and number of ribs was 23.8 ± 0.6. Rib number was normal in 86.8%. There were significant differences between the malignancy and control groups in age (control, 5.7 ± 5.1 years; malignancy, 7.8 ± 5.7 years, P = 0.00007), rib number (control, 23.9 ± 0.5; malignancy, 23.7 ± 0.7, P = 0.001), and normal/abnormal rib counts (control, 92% normal; malignancy, 82% normal, P = 0.003). In the malignant group, 50% had a lymphoproliferative malignancy, 33% a solid tumor, and 17.0% a neural tumor. Neural malignancies had a higher incidence of rib abnormalities compared with lymphoproliferative or solid malignancies (P = 0.01). Relative to the control group, those with a neural and lymphoproliferative malignancy were 6.23 (95% CI, 2.7-14.5) and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0-4.1) times more likely to have an abnormal rib count. CONCLUSIONS. Homeobox genes, important in vertebral and rib sequencing, are abnormally expressed in many different malignancies. This association is a question of great interest. What is the potential for rib number being used as a predictor of childhood malignancy? Can these findings be expanded to adults? These questions require further research. The association noted in this study is interesting but should not yet be used to alarm parents regarding an increased risk of malignancy in their children. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Child; Malignancy; Rib number","article; cancer risk; childhood cancer; controlled study; female; human; lymphoproliferative disease; major clinical study; male; nerve tumor; priority journal; retrospective study; rib malformation; school child; solid tumor; spine radiography; thorax radiography; United States; Adolescent; Brain Neoplasms; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Genes, Homeobox; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute; Male; Neoplasms; Neuroblastoma; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Ribs; Sarcoma; Sarcoma, Ewing's; Scoliosis; Soft Tissue Neoplasms; Wilms Tumor",,,,,"Anbazhagan, A., Raman, V., Homeobox genes: Molecular link between congenital anomalies and cancer (1997) Eur J Cancer, 33, pp. 635-637; Méhes, K., Signer, E., Plüss, H.J., Increased prevalence of minor anomalies in childhood malignancy (1985) Eur J Pediatr, 144, pp. 243-249; Schumacher, R., Mai, A., Gutjahr, P., Association of rib anomalies and malignancy in childhood (1992) Eur J Pediatr, 151, pp. 432-434; Danseco, E.R., Miller, T.R., Spicer, R.S., Incidence and cost of 1987-1994 childhood injuries: Demographic breakdowns (2000) Pediatrics, 105, pp. e27; Kilborn, T.N., Teh, J., Goodman, T.R., Paediatric manifestations of Langerhans cell histiocytosis: A review of the clinical and radiological findings (2003) Clin Radiol, 58, pp. 269-278; Egeler, R.M., D'Angio, G.J., Langerhans cell histiocytosis (1995) J Pediatr, 127, pp. 1-11; Herzog, K.M., Tubbs, R.R., Langerhans cell histiocytosis (1998) Adv Anat Pathol, 5, pp. 347-358; Arceci, R.J., The histiocytoses: The fall of the Tower of Babel (1999) Eur J Cancer, 35, pp. 747-769; Narod, S.A., Hawkins, M.M., Robertson, C.M., Congenital anomalies and childhood cancer in Great Britain (1997) Am J Hum Genet, 60, pp. 474-485; Burke, A.C., Nelson, C.E., Morgan, B.A., Hox genes and the evolution of vertebrate axial morphology (1995) Development, 121, pp. 333-346; Carapuco, M., Nóvoa, A., Bobola, N., Hox genes specify vertebral types in the presomitic mesoderm (2005) Genes Dev, 19, pp. 2116-2121; Wallin, J., Wilting, J., Koseki, H., The role of Pax-1 in axial skeleton development (1994) Development, 120, pp. 1109-1121; Johnson, D.R., O'Higgins, P.O., Is there a link between changes in the vertebral 'hox code' and the shape of vertebrae?

SPIN has an informatics component (sending tissue-related queries to multiple institutions via the internet) and a service component (providing histopathologically annotated tissue specimens for medical research). This paper examines if tissue blocks, identified by localized computer searches at participating institutions, can be retrieved in adequate quantity and quality to support medical researchers. Methods: Four centers evaluated pathology reports (1990-2005) for common and rare tumors to determine the percentage of cases where suitable tissue blocks with tumor were available. Each site generated a list of 100 common tumor cases (25 cases each of breast adenocarcinoma, colonic adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma) and 100 rare tumor cases (25 cases each of adrenal cortical carcinoma, gastro-intestinal stromal tumor [GIST], adenoid cystic carcinoma, and mycosis fungoides) using a combination of Tumor Registry, laboratory information system (LIS) and/or SPIN-related tools. Pathologists identified the slides/blocks with tumor and noted first 3 slides with largest tumor and availability of the corresponding block. Results: Common tumors cases (n = 400), the institutional retrieval rates (all blocks) were 83% (A), 95% (B), 80% (C), and 98% (D). Retrieval rate (tumor blocks) from all centers for common tumors was 73% with mean largest tumor size of 1.49 cm; retrieval (tumor blocks) was highest-lung (84%) and lowest-prostate (54%). Rare tumors cases (n = 400), each institution's retrieval rates (all blocks) were 78% (A), 73% (B), 67% (C), and 84% (D). Retrieval rate (tumor blocks) from all centers for rare tumors was 66% with mean largest tumor size of 1.56 cm; retrieval (tumor blocks) was highest for GIST (72%) and lowest for adenoid cystic carcinoma (58%). Conclusion: A ssessment shows availability and quality of archival tissue blocks that are retrievable and associated electronic data that can be of value for researchers. This study serves to compliment the data from which uniform use of the SPIN query tools by all four centers will be measured to assure and highlight the usefulness of archival material for obtaining tumor tissues for research. © 2007 Patel et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"access to information; adenoid cystic carcinoma; article; brain tumor; breast adenocarcinoma; cancer registry; cancer research; colon adenocarcinoma; computer program; controlled study; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; histopathology; hospital information system; human; human tissue; information dissemination; information retrieval; information system; Internet; lung squamous cell carcinoma; mycosis fungoides; prostate adenocarcinoma; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; tumor volume; health care facility; medical informatics; neoplasm; organization and management; pathology; statistics; United States; utilization review; paraffin; Humans; Medical Informatics; Neoplasms; Paraffin Embedding; Pathology, Clinical; Tissue Banks; United States",,,,,"Abati, A., Liotta, L.A., Looking forward in diagnostic pathology: The molecular superhighway (1996) Cancer, 78 (1), pp. 1-3. , 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960701)78:1<1::AID-CNCR1>3.0.CO;2-S 8646703; Fetsch, P.A., Simone, N.L., Bryant-Greenwood, P.K., Marincola, F.M., Filie, A.C., Petricoin, E.F., Liotta, L.A., Abati, A., Proteomic evaluation of archival cytologic material using SELDI affinity mass spectrometry: Potential for diagnostic applications (2002) Am J Clin Pathol, 118 (6), pp. 870-876. , 10.1309/EJKL-7328-KFPR-56WA 12472280; http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-01-006.html, Shared Pathology Informatics Network: Release Date: March 27, 2000, RFA: CA-01-006, National Cancer InstituteBecich, M.J., The role of the pathologist as tissue refiner and data miner: The impact of functional genomics on the modern pathology laboratory and the critical roles of pathology informatics and bioinformatics (2000) Mol Diagn, 5 (4), pp. 287-299. , 10.1054/modi.2000.20431 11172493; http://www.cancerdiagnosis.nci.nih.gov/spin/, Shared Pathology Informatics Network websiteMarshall, E., Panel proposes tighter rules for tissue studies (1998) Science, 282 (5397), pp. 2165-2166. , 10.1126/science.282.5397.2165a 9890818; Mizuno, T., Nagamura, H., Iwamoto, K.S., Ito, T., Fukuhara, T., Tokunaga, M., Tokuoka, S., Seyama, T., RNA from decades-old archival tissue blocks for retrospective studies (1998) Diagn Mol Pathol, 7 (4), pp. 202-208. , 10.1097/00019606-199808000-00004 9917130; Qualman, S.J., France, M., Grizzle, W.E., LiVolsi, V.A., Moskaluk, C.A., Ramirez, N.C., Washington, M.K., Establishing a tumour bank: Banking, informatics and ethics (2004) Br J Cancer, 90 (6), pp. 1115-1119. , 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601678 15026787; Cooperberg, M.R., Broering, J.M., Litwin, M.S., Lubeck, D.P., Mehta, S.S., Henning, J.M., Carroll, P.R., The contemporary management of prostate cancer in the United States: Lessons from the cancer of the prostate strategic urologic research endeavor (CapSURE), a national disease registry (2004) J Urol, 171 (4), pp. 1393-1401. , 10.1097/01.ju.0000107247.81471.06 15017184; Lubeck, D.P., Litwin, M.S., Henning, J.M., Stier, D.M., Mazonson, P., Fisk, R., Carroll, P.R., The CaPSURE database: A methodology for clinical practice and research in prostate cancer.

Walnut St., Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States","Human ABCG2, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily which transports a wide variety of substrates, is highly expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblasts, in the canalicular membranes of liver, in the apical membrane of the small intestine epithelium, and at the luminal surface of the endothelial cells of human brain micro vessels. This strategic tissue localization indicates that ABCG2 plays an important role in absorption, distribution, and elimination of xenobiotics and drugs. High ABCG2 expression has also been detected in many hematological malignancies and solid tumors, indicating that ABCG2 is likely responsible also for the multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy. Indeed, ABCG2 can actively transport structurally diverse conjugated- or unconjugated-organic molecules and various anticancer drugs. Many chemo-sensitizing agents have been discovered, which can be developed for increasing drug adsorption and reversing drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy by inhibiting ABCG2 function or expression. This review summarizes current knowledge on ABCG2, its relevance to multidrug resistance and drug disposition, and its evergrowing numbers of substrates and inhibitors. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","ABC transporter; ABCG2; Chemo-sensitization; Drug resistance; Inhibitors; MDR; Oligomerization; Substrates","9 aminocamptothecin; antineoplastic agent; biochanin A; biricodar; breast cancer resistance protein; camptothecin; cimetidine; cyclosporin; daunorubicin; diethylstilbestrol; doxorubicin; elacridar; fibrinogen receptor antagonist; flavopiridol; fumitremorgin C; gefitinib; idarubicin; imatinib; irinotecan; isoquercitrin; me 3229; me 3277; methotrexate; mitoxantrone; multidrug resistance protein 1; rubitecan; tamoxifen; topotecan; unindexed drug; verapamil; acute granulocytic leukemia; antineoplastic activity; biliary excretion; bioavailability; blood placenta barrier; brain blood vessel; cancer; cancer chemotherapy; clinical trial; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug clearance; drug disposition; drug distribution; drug elimination; drug inhibition; drug metabolism; drug penetration; drug potentiation; drug resistance; drug sensitization; drug structure; drug targeting; drug transport; drug uptake; human; liver membrane; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; placental transfer; protein expression; protein function; protein structure; review; small intestine mucosa; structure activity relation; syncytiotrophoblast; tissue distribution; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Humans; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasms",,"biochanin A, 491-80-5; biricodar, 174254-13-8; camptothecin, 7689-03-4; cimetidine, 51481-61-9, 70059-30-2; cyclosporin, 79217-60-0; daunorubicin, 12707-28-7, 20830-81-3, 23541-50-6; diethylstilbestrol, 30498-85-2, 56-53-1; doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; elacridar, 143664-11-3; flavopiridol, 131740-09-5, 146426-40-6; fumitremorgin C, 118974-02-0; gefitinib, 184475-35-2, 184475-55-6, 184475-56-7; idarubicin, 57852-57-0, 58957-92-9; imatinib, 152459-95-5, 220127-57-1; irinotecan, 100286-90-6; isoquercitrin, 21637-25-2, 482-35-9; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; mitoxantrone, 65271-80-9, 70476-82-3; rubitecan, 91421-42-0; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1; topotecan, 119413-54-6, 123948-87-8; verapamil, 152-11-4, 52-53-9; ABCG2 protein, human; Antineoplastic Agents; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Neoplasm Proteins","gf 120918; gleevec; me 3229; me 3277; zd 1839",,"Doyle, L.A., Yang, W., Abruzzo, L.V., Krogmann, T., Gao, Y., Rishi, A.K., Ross, D.D., (1998) Proc.

Gates, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States","OBJECTIVE: To report the presence of microscopic neoplasms of the testis in men with anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis (Ma2-encephalitis) and to discuss the clinical implications. METHODS: Orchiectomy specimens were examined using immunohistochemistry with Ma2 and Oct4 antibodies. RESULTS: Among 25 patients with Ma2-encephalitis younger than 50 years, 19 had germ-cell tumors, and 6 had no evidence of cancer. These 6 patients underwent orchiectomy because they fulfilled five criteria: 1) demonstration of anti-Ma2 antibodies in association with MRI or clinical features compatible with Ma2-encephalitis, 2) life-threatening or progressive neurologic deficits, 3) age < 50 years, 4) absence of other tumors, and 5) new testicular enlargement or risk factors for germ-cell tumors, mainly cryptorchidism or ultrasound evidence of testicular microcalcifications. All orchiectomy specimens showed intratubular-germ cell neoplasms unclassified type (IGCNU) and other abnormalities including microcalcifications, atrophy, fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, or hypospermatogenesis. Ma2 was expressed by neoplastic cells in three of three patients examined. Even though most patients had severe neurologic deficits at the time of orchiectomy (median progression of symptoms, 10 months), 4 had partial improvement and prolonged stabilization (8 to 84 months, median 22.5 months) and two did not improve after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: In young men with Ma2-encephalitis, 1) the disorder should be attributed to a germ-cell neoplasm of the testis unless another Ma2-expressing tumor is found, 2) negative tumor markers, ultrasound, body CT, or PET do not exclude an intratubular germ-cell neoplasm of the testis, and 3) if no tumor is found, the presence of the five indicated criteria should prompt consideration of orchiectomy. ©2007AAN Enterprises, Inc.",,"antibody; ma2 antibody; oct4 antibody; article; calcification; clinical article; clinical feature; cryptorchism; echography; encephalitis; fibrosis; genital system disease; germ cell tumor; human; human tissue; hypospermatogenesis; immunohistochemistry; inflammatory infiltrate; male; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; orchiectomy; priority journal; risk factor; testicular enlargement; testis atrophy; testis cancer; testis tumor; tumor cell; Adult; Antigens, Neoplasm; Autoantibodies; Brain; Diagnosis, Differential; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Limbic Encephalitis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neural Pathways; Orchiectomy; Predictive Value of Tests; Testicular Neoplasms; Tumor Markers, Biological",,"Antigens, Neoplasm; Autoantibodies; Ma2 antigen; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Tumor Markers, Biological",,,"Graus, F., Dalmau, J., Rene, R., Anti-Hu antibodies in patients with small-cell lung cancer: Association with complete response to therapy and improved survival (1997) J Clin Oncol, 15, pp. 2866-2872; Darnell, R.B., Posner, J.B., Paraneoplastic syndromes involving the nervous system (2003) N Engl J Med, 349, pp. 1543-1554; Younes-Mhenni, S., Janier, M.F., Cinotti, L., FDG-PET improves tumour detection in patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (2004) Brain, 127, pp. 2331-2338; Dalmau, J., Graus, F., Villarejo, A., Clinical analysis of anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis (2004) Brain, 127, pp. 1831-1844; Montironi, R., Intratubular germ cell neoplasia of the testis: Testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (2002) Eur Urol, 41, pp. 651-654; Mathew RM, Yamamoto T, Nakamura K, Dropcho E, Tsuji S, Dalmau J.

We suggest that shared genetic risk factors for the development of cancer and cognitive problems, including low-efficiency efflux pumps, deficits in DNA-repair mechanisms and/or a deregulated immune response, coupled with the effect of chemotherapy on these systems, might contribute to cognitive decline in patients after chemotherapy. Furthermore, the genetically modulated reduction of capacity for neural repair and neurotransmitter activity, as well as reduced antioxidant capacity associated with treatment-induced reduction in oestrogen and testosterone levels, might interact with these mechanisms and/or have independent effects on cognitive function. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"estrogen; progesterone; antioxidant activity; cancer chemotherapy; cognition; DNA repair; gene control; genetic risk; human; nerve regeneration; neurotransmission; priority journal; review; risk factor; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Brain; Cognition Disorders; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Neoplasms; Risk Factors",,"progesterone, 57-83-0; Antineoplastic Agents",,,"Silberfarb, P.M., Chemotherapy and cognitive defects in cancer patients (1983) Annu.

Walnut, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States","Neuronal DNA repair remains one of the most exciting areas for investigation, particularly as a means to compare the DNA repair response in mitotic (cancer) vs. post-mitotic (neuronal) cells. In addition, the role of DNA repair in neuronal cell survival and response to aging and environmental insults is of particular interest. DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as generated by mitochondrial respiration includes altered bases, abasic sites, and single- and double-strand breaks which can be prevented by the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. Oxidative stress accumulates in the DNA of the human brain over time especially in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is proposed to play a critical role in aging and in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, ALS, and Alzheimer's diseases. Because DNA damage accumulates in the mtDNA more than nuclear DNA, there is increased interest in DNA repair pathways and the consequence of DNA damage in the mitochondria of neurons. The type of damage that is most likely to occur in neuronal cells is oxidative DNA damage which is primarily removed by the BER pathway. Following the notion that the bulk of neuronal DNA damage is acquired by oxidative DNA damage and ROS, the BER pathway is a likely area of focus for neuronal studies of DNA repair. BER variations in brain aging and pathology in various brain regions and tissues are presented. Therefore, the BER pathway is discussed in greater detail in this review than other repair pathways. Other repair pathways including direct reversal, nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining are also discussed. Finally, there is a growing interest in the role that DNA repair pathways play in the clinical arena as they relate to the neurotoxicity and neuropathy associated with cancer treatments. Among the numerous side effects of cancer treatments, major clinical effects include neurocognitive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy. These symptoms occur frequently and have not been effectively studied at the cellular or molecular level. Studies of DNA repair may help our understanding of how those cells that are not dividing could succumb to neurotoxicity with the clinical manifestations discussed in the following article. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

GCTs demonstrate extremely interesting biological features because of their close relationships with normal embryonal development as demonstrated by the pluripotentiality of some undifferentiated GCT variants. The similarities between GCTs and normal germ cell development have made it possible to identify possible pathogenetic pathways in neoplastic transformation and progression of GCTs. Genotypic and immunophenotypic profiles of these tumours are also useful in establishing and narrowing the differential diagnosis in cases of suspected GCTs. Recently, OCT4 (also known as OCT3 or POU5F1), a transcription factor that has been recognized as fundamental in the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells, has been proposed as a useful marker for GCTs that exhibit features of pluripotentiality, specifically seminoma/dysgerminoma/ germinoma and embryonal carcinoma. The development of commercially available OCT4-specific antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded specimens has generated increasing numbers of reports of OCT4 expression in a wide variety of gonadal and extragonadal GCTs. OCT4 immunostaining has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for seminomatous/(dys)germinomatous tumours and in embryonal carcinoma variants of non-seminomatous GCTs, whether in primary gonadal or extragonadal sites or in metastatic lesions. Therefore, OCT4 immunohistochemistry is an additional helpful marker both in the differential diagnosis of specific histological subtypes of GCTs and in establishing a germ cell origin for some metastatic tumours of uncertain primary. OCT4 expression has also been reported in pre-invasive conditions such as intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified (IGCNU) and the germ cell component of gonadoblastoma.

Current diagnosis and management of SCCUB are often patterned after small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, SCCUB therapy is different from that for SCLC. For example, many patients with SCCUB undergo local resection, which is rarely performed in SCLC. As in SCLC, platinum-etoposide combination chemotherapy is employed as the main systemic treatment option for SCCUB. Chemotherapy is usually combined with other therapeutic modalities, especially in patients whose disease is limited to the locoregional area. Owing to the rarity of this malignancy, no prospective study has been performed that establishes the efficacy and duration of chemotherapy or the relative efficacy of platinum-etoposide versus other chemotherapeutic regimens. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current status of SCCUB diagnosis and management, as well as some unique insights into this rare tumor. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.","Chemotherapy; Radiation therapy; Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder; Small cell lung cancer; Targeted therapy","antineoplastic agent; carboplatin; CD56 antigen; chromogranin; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; cytokeratin 20; cytokeratin 7; doxorubicin; etoposide; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; fluorouracil; gastrin releasing peptide; gemcitabine; ifosfamide; irinotecan; methotrexate; neuron specific enolase; paclitaxel; platinum complex; serotonin; somatomedin C; synaptophysin; taxane derivative; topotecan; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; vinblastine; bladder biopsy; bladder carcinogenesis; bladder carcinoma; brain metastasis; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer palliative therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer regression; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical feature; cystectomy; cystoscopy; diagnostic value; disease marker; drug efficacy; drug response; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; human; immunohistochemistry; positron emission tomography; prognosis; repeated drug dose; review; skull irradiation; small cell carcinoma; systemic therapy; treatment duration; tumor differentiation; unspecified side effect; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Small Cell; Cell Lineage; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Chromosome Aberrations; Combined Modality Therapy; Cystectomy; Female; Hematuria; Humans; Keratin-20; Keratin-7; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasm Staging; Palliative Care; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Risk Factors; Smoking; Survival Rate; Tumor Markers, Biological; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",,"carboplatin, 41575-94-4; cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; etoposide, 33419-42-0; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18, 63503-12-8; fluorouracil, 51-21-8; gastrin releasing peptide, 74815-57-9, 80043-53-4; gemcitabine, 103882-84-4; ifosfamide, 3778-73-2; irinotecan, 100286-90-6; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; paclitaxel, 33069-62-4; serotonin, 50-67-9; somatomedin C, 67763-96-6; topotecan, 119413-54-6, 123948-87-8; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, 37221-79-7; vinblastine, 865-21-4; Keratin-20; Keratin-7; Neoplasm Proteins; Tumor Markers, Biological",,,"Cramer, S.F., Aikawa, M., Cebelin, M., Neurosecretory granules in small cell invasive carcinoma of the urinary bladder (1981) Cancer, 47, pp. 724-730; Blomjous, C.E., Vos, W., De Voogt, H.J., Van der Valk, P., Meijer, C.J., Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.

In this study, the transport mechanism for choline was investigated in cultured PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, tritiated hemicholinium 3 (HC-3), a well-known inhibitor of choline transport, was studied as a prototypic molecular imaging probe in PC-3 cells and 9L glioma-bearing rats. [3H]Choline uptake by PC-3 cells was found to have both facultative and nonfacilitative components. Facultative transport was characterized by partial sodium dependence and intermediate affinity (K M = 9.7 ± 0.8 μM). HC-3 inhibited choline with a K I of 10.5± 2.2 μM. Ouabain (1 mM) caused a 94% reduction in choline uptake. At physiologic choline concentration, phosphocholine was the rapid and predominant metabolic fate. The binding of [3H]HC-3 to PC-3 cells was rapid and specific (competitively blocked with unlabeled HC-3). Biodistribution of [3H]HC-3 in 9L glioma-bearing rats showed the ranking of uptake to be kidney > lung > tumor > liver > skeletal muscle ≈ blood > brain. In comparison with [14C]choline, [ 3H]HC-3 showed over twofold higher tumor uptake and favorable uptake ratios of tumor to blood, tumor to muscle, tumor to lung, and tumor to liver. The data demonstrate the quantitative importance of an intermediate-affinity, partially sodium-dependent choline transport system on choline processing in PC-3 cancer cells. The biodistribution properties of [3H]HC-3 in tumor-bearing rats encourage the development of molecular imaging probes based on choline transporter binding ligands. © 2006 BC Decker Inc.",,"Disease control;

The diagnosis of NBCCS was suspected based on the clinical examination, patient and family medical histories, and histopathological characteristics of the tumor. Radiotherapy was withheld. The diagnosis of NBCCS was confirmed by DNA testing, which revealed a novel mutation in the PTCH gene. This is the first report of an African-American child with MB diagnosed with NBCCS prior to radiotherapy. Although only a small number of patients with MB have NBCCS, the diagnosis must be considered because radiotherapy in such patients can lead to the formation of BCCs and other intracranial neoplasms within the irradiated field. This case emphasizes the importance of obtaining thorough family and patient medical histories and of carefully examining the patient and close relatives for signs of NBCCS to avoid the potentially devastating consequences of missing this diagnosis.","Desmoplastic medulloblastoma; Gorlin syndrome; Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome; Pediatric neurosurgery; PTCH; Sonic hedgehog protein","protein Patched; African American; anamnesis; article; basal cell nevus syndrome; cancer radiotherapy; cancer susceptibility; case report; clinical feature; craniotomy; disease association; disease course; family history; follow up; gene mutation; histopathology; human; laminectomy; male; medulloblastoma; multiple cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; preschool child; priority journal; treatment outcome; tumor diagnosis; tumor localization; African Americans; Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome; Brain Neoplasms; Cerebellar Neoplasms; Cerebral Ventricle Neoplasms; Child, Preschool; Cranial Fossa, Posterior; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Medulloblastoma; Mutation; Neoplasms, Multiple Primary; Receptors, Cell Surface",,"patched receptors; Receptors, Cell Surface",,,"Amlashi, S.F.A., Riffaud, L., Brassier, G., Morandi, X., Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome: Relation with desmoplastic medulloblastoma in infancy.

Expression of drug-resistance genes in hematopoietic cells has been proposed as a means to decrease the toxicity of cytotoxic agents. In this pilot study, we utilized a retroviral vector expressing methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) to transduce hematopoietic progenitors, which were subsequently used in the setting of alkylator therapy (procarbazine, CCNU, vincristine (PCV)) for poor prognosis brain tumors. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells were collected by apheresis and enriched for CD34+ expression. Nine subjects were infused with CD34+-enriched cells treated in a transduction procedure involving a 4-day exposure to cytokines with vector exposure on days 3 and 4. No major adverse event was related to the gene therapy procedure. Importantly, the engraftment kinetics of the treated product was similar to unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells, suggesting that the ex vivo manipulation did not significantly reduce engrafting progenitor cell function. Gene-transduced cells were detected in all subjects. Although the level and duration was limited, patients receiving cells transduced using fibronectin 'preloaded' with virus supernatant appeared to show improved in vivo marking frequency. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and safety of utilizing MGMT-transduced CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cells in the setting of chemotherapy. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Brain tumors; Clinical trial; Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase; Retroviral gene transfer","alkylating agent; CD34 antigen; cytotoxic agent; fibronectin; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; lomustine; methylated DNA protein cysteine methyltransferase; procarbazine; retrovirus vector; vincristine; absence; adult; aged; apheresis; article; brain tumor; cancer combination chemotherapy; cell function; clinical article; clinical trial; dose response; drug safety; female; gene expression; gene transfer; genetic transduction; hematopoietic cell; histoplasmosis; human; human cell; lung diffusion capacity; lung fibrosis; lung function test; male; peripheral blood stem cell; pilot study; priority journal; pruritus; respiratory failure; side effect; stem cell; stem cell gene therapy; viral gene therapy; virus gene; Adolescent; Adult; Antigens, CD34; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Brain Neoplasms; Colony-Forming Units Assay; DNA Primers; Female; Fibronectins; Gene Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; Humans; Lomustine; Male; Middle Aged; O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase; Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation; Pilot Projects; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Procarbazine; Retroviridae; Transduction, Genetic; Vincristine",,"fibronectin, 86088-83-7; lomustine, 13010-47-4; procarbazine, 366-70-1, 671-16-9; vincristine, 57-22-7; Antigens, CD34; Antineoplastic Agents; DNA Primers; Fibronectins; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor, 143011-72-7; Lomustine, 13010-47-4; O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.63; Procarbazine, 671-16-9; Vincristine, 57-22-7",,"Amgen, Canada","Chu, E., DeVita, V.T., Principles of cancer management: Chemotherapy (2001) Cancer Principles and Practice of Oncology, pp. 289-305. , DeVita VT, Hellman S, Rosenberg SA (eds).

Materials and methods: Eight patients with 13 ependymomas were treated with GK-based SRS in our institution for gross disease. Five patients were treated for recurrent disease that developed after surgery and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), two received SRS to the gross disease after surgery and EBRT, and one received SRS alone (in a 1.3 year old child). Median EBRT dose was 54.4 Gy (range 50-55.8 Gy). Median SRS dose was 14 Gy (range 12-20 Gy). Seven of eight (87.5%) patients had SRS to a single lesion and one of eight (12.5%) patients had treatment to six tumors in three different sessions. Results: The median follow up was 3 0.2 months (range 8-65.4 months). Out of the eight patients treated with SRS, six (75%) were alive, four (50%) were alive with no recurrence, two (25%) were alive with recurrence, and two (25%) died of recurrent disease. Both patients treated with SRS as a boost were alive and without recurrence. Out of the five patients who received SRS as salvage treatment, three (60%) were alive, two (40%) were alive without recurrence, two (40%) developed distant failure, and three (60%) had in-field control. Two patients who received SRS to their brainstem lesions developed symptoms related to radionecrosis and were successfully treated with steroid with good control of symptoms. Conclusions: GK-based SRS appears to be a feasible and safe treatment modality for patients with ependymoma with unresectable gross disease or gross residual disease after surgery. SRS provides reasonable local control but out-of-field tumor progression remains an issue. For patients who receive SRS as a boost, the local control appears to be excellent. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Ependymoma; Gross disease; Radiosurgery","cisplatin; cyclophosphamide;

As this finding was not corroborated by previous or subsequent metaiodobenzylguanidine scans or by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we attribute the finding to being a false-positive result from adrenal hyperplasia owing to chronic use of ACTH and not to neuroblastoma.

Ependymomas typically have a sharp tumor-brain parenchyma interface and this characteristic lends itself well to stereotactic radiation delivery. Data on the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) for ependymoma in various settings have emerged over the past 10 years. SRS has been used in recurrent disease and as a boost after external beam radiation therapy. FSRT has been used in pediatric brain tumors and can potentially limit the long-term toxicities associated with radiation therapy by reducing the amount of normal brain parenchyma treated. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine the long-term efficacy and toxicities associated with these treatment modalities. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.","Ependymoma; Stereotactic radiosurgery; Stereotactic radiotherapy","brain tumor; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; cancer survival; ependymoma; facial nerve paralysis; follow up; gamma knife radiosurgery; human; radiation dose fractionation; radiation necrosis; review; seizure; stereotaxic surgery; treatment planning; Brain Neoplasms; Ependymoma; Humans; Radiosurgery",,,,,"Foreman, N.K., Love, S., Thorne, R., Intracranial ependymomas: Analysis of prognostic factors in a population-based series (1996) Pediatr.

Thus, nutrition support has become an important therapeutic adjunctive to the care of these patients. For patients unable to feed themselves, nutrition can be delivered via the parenteral or enteral routes. The formulations used to deliver nutrients and the route of nutrient delivery, absorption, and processing differ substantially between parenteral and enteral nutrition. Over the past two decades, many randomised clinical trials have assessed the effects of parenteral versus enteral nutrition on outcomes (ie, complications, infections, length of stay, costs, mortality) in diverse inpatient populations. From a search of medical publications, studies were selected that assessed important clinical outcomes of parenteral versus enteral feeding or intravenous fluids in patients with trauma/burn injuries, surgery, cancer, pancreatic disease, inflammatory bowel disease, critical illness, liver failure, acute renal failure, and organ transplantation. Our goal was to determine the optimum route of feeding in these patient groups. The available evidence lends support to the use of enteral over parenteral feeding in inpatients with functioning gastrointestinal tracts. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The techniques used to perform SBRT were initially modeled after intracranial radiosurgery, although considerable evolution in technique and conduct has occurred for extracranial applications. Unlike intracranial radiosurgery, SBRT requires characterization and accounting for inherent organ movement including breathing motion. Potent dose hypofractionation schedules have been used with SBRT such that the treatment is generally both ablative and convenient. Because the treatment is severely damaging to tissues within and about the target, the volume of adjacent normal tissue must be strictly minimized to avoid toxic late effects. Outcomes in various sites show very high rates of local control with toxicity mostly related to tubular tissues like the airways and bowels. With proper conduct though, SBRT can be an extremely effective treatment option for oligometastases. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Tenth Street, Bloomington, IN 47405, United States","Cancer is a health endpoint influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetic history, individual behavior, and environmental insults. The ubiquity of toxicants in the environment has raised questions about the extent of their role in causing cancer in humans. More specifically, it is desirable to understand the cancer incidence due to airborne toxicants in anthropogenic pollution. One particular class of such pollutants is volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This paper reports an epidemiological investigation of the incidence of cancer in the 92 counties of Indiana. We evaluated the relationship between the amount of VOCs released in each county, as reported by the Toxic Release Inventory, and the county-by-county incidence of various types of cancer, especially those of less common organ systems not directly associated with the absorption or distribution of toxicants. Our evaluation considered chlorinated versus nonchlorinated emissions as well as stack versus fugitive emissions. We evaluated three models: linear, quadratic, and polynomial. Of these, the quadratic model appeared to be the best predictor (highest r2) for most endpoints for which there was a positive correlation. However, the linear model was the most sensitive (lowest P-value) for skin, melanoma, and endocrine-related cancers, including female genital system cancers. Our results indicate a relationship between emissions of VOCs and the incidence of some types of cancers. Most notable were strong correlations between VOC emissions and cancers of the brain, nervous system, endocrine system, and skin. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This study combined rhAngiostatin with a standard chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and methods: Eligible patients had chemotherapy-naïve stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) or IV NSCLC, performance status (PS) 0 or 1, no history of bleeding, brain metastasis or requirements for anti-coagulation. Patients received carboplatin (AUC 5) intravenously and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) intravenously day 1 + subcutaneous rhAngiostatin at either 15 mg or 60 mg twice daily. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks, for up to six cycles. Patients without progression after completing at least four cycles were continued on maintenance rhAngiostatin until disease progression. Results: Patient characteristics (n = 24) were: 16 males, median age 66 years (range 45-78), 54% PS 1, 83.3% stage IV and 62.5% adenocarcinoma. Grade 3/4 toxicities included: fatigue 47.8%, neutropenia 39.1%, dyspnea 39.1%, vascular 26.1% and infection 17.4%. The overall response rate was 39.1%, 39.1% stable disease and 21.7% progressive disease. Median time to progression was 144 days, and 1-year survival was 45.8%. Conclusions: rhAngiostatin in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin is feasible and results in a high disease control rate in patients with advanced NSCLC. © 2005 European Society for Medical Oncology.","Angiogenesis; Carboplatin; Lung cancer; Paclitaxel; RhAngiostatin","angiostatin; carboplatin; paclitaxel; recombinant human angiostatin; unclassified drug; adult; advanced cancer; aged; anemia; arthralgia; article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer staging; cancer survival; cerebrovascular accident; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug clearance; drug efficacy; drug exposure; dyspnea; fatigue; female; heart atrium fibrillation; human; infection; lung adenocarcinoma; lung embolism; lung non small cell cancer; major clinical study; male; myalgia; nausea; neuropathy; neutropenia; phase 2 clinical trial; pleura effusion; priority journal; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; skin toxicity; transient ischemic attack; vascular disease; vomiting; Aged; Angiostatins; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Brain Neoplasms; Carboplatin; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Disease Progression; Disease-Free Survival; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Paclitaxel; Proteomics; Recombinant Proteins; Survival Rate; Time Factors",,"angiostatin, 172642-30-7, 86090-08-6; carboplatin, 41575-94-4; paclitaxel, 33069-62-4; Angiostatins, 86090-08-6; Carboplatin, 41575-94-4; Paclitaxel, 33069-62-4; Recombinant Proteins",,,"Chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis using updated data on individual patients from 52 randomized clinical trials (1995) BMJ, 311, pp. 899-909. , Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group; Marine, P., Pampallona, S., Preatoni, F., Chemotherapy vs supportive care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Results of a meta-analysis of the literature (1994) Chest, 106, pp. 861-865; Stephens, R., Fairlamb, N., Gower, N., The big lung trial (BLT): Determining the value of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for all patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

High-grade astrocytomas (HGA) carry a dismal prognosis and compose nearly 20% of all childhood brain tumors. The role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) in the treatment of HGA remains unclear. METHODS. In a nationwide study, The Children's Cancer Group (CCG) prospectively evaluated 102 children with HGA and postoperative residual disease for efficacy and toxicity of four courses of HDCT before radiotherapy (RT). Patients were randomly assigned to one of three couplets of drugs: carboplatin/etoposide (Regimen A), ifosfamide/etoposide (Regimen B), or cyclophosphamide/etoposide (Regimen C). After HDCT, all patients were to receive local RT followed by lomustine and vincristine. Twenty-six patients were excluded after central neuroradiographic review (n = 8) or pathology review (n = 18). RESULTS. Of 76 evaluable patients (median age, 11.95 yrs; range, 3-20 yrs), 30 patients relapsed during HDCT, and 11 others did not complete HDCT because of toxicity. Nonhematologic serious toxicities were common (29%), and 21% of patients did not receive RT. Objective response rates were not associated with amount of residual disease and did not statistically differ between regimens: 27% (Regimen A), 8% (Regimen B), and 29% (Regimen C). Overall survival (OS) was 24% ± 5% at 5 years and did not differ between groups. Median time to an event was longest for Regimen A (283 days compared with 83 and 91 days for Regimens B and C, respectively). The five-year, event-free survival (EFS) rate for all patients was 8% ± 3% and 14% ± 7% for Regimen A (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS. OS and EFS were not affected by histologic grade. Patients who responded to HDCT had a nominally higher survival rate (P = 0.03 for trend).

Forces obtained with Chinese hamster ovary cells, a malignant human brain tumor cell line, and human endothelial cells (EA hy926) were found to be 28 ± 10 pN, 29 ± 9 pN, and 29 ± 10 pN, respectively, independent of the nature of attachment to the cantilever. The rather large variation of the tether pulling forces measured at several locations on individual cells points to the existence of heterogeneity in the membrane properties of a morphologically homogeneous cell. Measurement of the summary lengths of the simultaneously extracted tethers provides a measure of the size of the available membrane reservoir through which co-existing tethers are associated. As expected, partial disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and removal of the hyaluronan backbone of the glycocalyx were observed to result in a marked decrease (30-50%) in the magnitude and a significant sharpening of the force distribution indicating reduced heterogeneity of membrane properties. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of the plasma membrane to locally produce multiple interdependent tethers-a process that could play an important role in the mechanical association of cells with their environment. © 2005 by the Biophysical Society.",,"actin; hyaluronic acid; nanotube; animal cell; article; atomic force microscopy; cancer cell culture; cell membrane; cell size; cell structure; CHO cell; controlled study; cytoskeleton; endothelium cell; force; glycocalyx; human; human cell; nonhuman; reproducibility; structure analysis; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Cell Membrane; Cell Surface Extensions; Cells, Cultured; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Membrane Fluidity; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Physical Stimulation; Animalia; Cricetulus griseus",,"hyaluronic acid, 31799-91-4, 9004-61-9, 9067-32-7",,,"Sheetz, M.P., Cellular plasma membrane domains (1995) Mol.

In this study we examined the effect of CNS tumours on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation maps in the primary and supplementary motor cortex. A total of 33 tumour patients and five healthy right-handed adults were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into four groups based on tumour type and distance from primary motor cortex: (1) intra-axial, near, (2) extra-axial, near, (3) intra-axial, far and (4) extra-axial, far. The intra-axial groups consisted of patients with astrocytomas, glioblastomas and metastatic tumours of mixed histology; all the extra-axial tumours were meningiomas. The motor task was a bilateral, self-paced, finger-tapping paradigm. Anatomical and functional data were acquired with a 1.5 T GE Echospeed scanner. Maps of the motor areas were derived from the BOLD images, using SPM99 software. For each subject we first determined the activation volume in the primary motor area and the supplementary motor area (SMA) and then calculated the percentage difference between the hemispheres. Two factors influenced the activation volumes: tumour type (p <0.04) and distance from the eloquent cortex (P <0.06). Patients in group 1 (intra-axial, near) had the smallest activation area in the primary motor cortex, the greatest percentage difference in the activation volume between the hemispheres, and the largest activation volume in the SMA. Patients in group 4 (extra-axial, far) had the largest activation volume in the primary motor cortex, the least percentage difference in volume between the hemispheres, and the smallest activation volume in the SMA. There was no significant change in the volume of the SMA in any group, compared with controls, suggesting that, although there is a gradual decrease in SMA volume with distance from the primary motor area, the effect on motor reorganisation is minimal. All the tumour patients showed a net loss in total activation volumes (both hemispheres plus SMA) compared with controls. The effect of the tumours on interhemispheric volume differences was: group 1>group 3>group 2>group 4. Within the intra-axial tumours, there was no significant effect of tumour type on the results. We conclude that BOLD-imaged activation volume is affected at least by the interplay of two factors: tumour type and distance from the motor cortex. Further, all tumours may be expected to cause some loss of activation volumes in motor areas. We suggest that, with proper precautions and planning, BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) maps can be useful in minimising damage to the functional areas. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Activation volume; fMRI; Primary motor area; Supplementary motor area; Tumour","adult; article; astrocytoma; blood oxygenation; brain cancer; brain malformation; brain mapping; brain metastasis; clinical article; computer program; controlled study; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; glioblastoma; human; image analysis; male; meningioma; motor cortex; priority journal; task performance; Adult; Aged; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Cortex",,,"1.5 T GE Echospeed, General Electric; SPM99","General Electric","Ogawa, S., Lee, T., Kay, A., Brain magnetic resonance imaging with contrast dependent on blood oxygenation (1990) Proc.

Although more than 10 chronic bioassays indicate that AN produces multiple tumors in rats and mice, a number of large, well-conducted epidemiology studies provide no evidence of a causal association between AN exposure and cancer mortality of any type. The epidemiological data include early industry exposures that are far higher than occur today and that approach or exceed levels found to be tumorigenic in animals. Despite the absence of positive findings in the epidemiology data, a dose-response assessment was conducted for AN based on brain tumors in rats. Mechanistic studies implicate the involvement of oxidative stress in rat brain due to a metabolite (2-cyanoethylene oxide or CEO, cyanide), but do not conclusively rule out a potential role for the direct genotoxicity of CEO. A PBPK model was used to predict internal doses (peak CEO in brain) for 12 data sets, which were pooled together to provide a consistent characterization of the dose-response relationship for brain tumor incidence in the rat. The internal dose corresponding to a 5% increase in extra risk (ED05 = 0.017 mg/L brain) and its lower confidence limit (LED05 = 0.014 mg/L brain) was used as the point of departure. The weight-of-evidence supports the use of a nonlinear extrapolation for the cancer dose-response assessment. A quantitative comparison of the epidemiology exposure-response data (lung and brain cancer mortality) to the rat brain tumor data in terms of internal dose adds to the confidence in the nonlinear extrapolation. Uncertainty factors of 200 and 220 (for the oral and inhalation routes, respectively) were applied to the LED05 to account for interspecies variation, intraspecies variation, and the severity of the response measure. Accordingly, oral doses below 0.009 mg/kg-day and air concentrations below 0.1 mg/m3 are not expected to pose an appreciable risk to human populations exposed to AN. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

These effects have been attributed to beneficial activity of these steroids on lipid metabolism as well as direct effects on the vasculature via modulation of nitric-oxide synthase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathways. In this issue of Molecular Pharmacology, Stirone et al. (p. 959) present evidence suggesting that 17 β-estradiol may also exert vasoprotective effects in cerebral blood vessels via stimulation of mitochondrial energy production capacity and inhibition of reactive oxygen species production. These data indicate not only yet another potential mechanism underlying the vasoprotective effects of estrogens but also that the estrogen receptor may coordinate gene expression in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.

It represents the extreme example of a class of important human health promoting agents known as omega-3 fatty acids. DHA is particularly abundant in retinal and brain tissue, often comprising about 50% of the membrane's total acyl chains. Inadequate amounts of DHA have been linked to a wide variety of abnormalities ranging from visual acuity and learning irregularities to depression and suicide. The molecular mode of action of DHA, while not yet understood, has been the focus of our research. Here we briefly summarize how DHA affects membrane physical properties with an emphasis on membrane signaling domains known as rafts. We report the uptake of DHA into brain phosphatidylethanolamines and the subsequent exclusion of cholesterol from the DHA-rich membranes. We also demonstrate that DHA-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is associated with externalization of phosphatidylserine and membrane disruption (""blebbing""). We conclude with a proposal of how DHA incorporation into membranes may control cell biochemistry and physiology. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2005.","Apoptosis; Docosahexaenoic acid; Lipid rafts; Membranes; Phospholipids","carbon; CD8 antigen; ceramide; cholesterol; docosahexaenoic acid; fish oil; long chain fatty acid; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; omega 3 fatty acid; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylserine; protein kinase C; rhodopsin; sphingomyelin; Thy 1 antigen; unsaturated fatty acid; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; bilayer membrane; biochemistry; brain region; breast cancer; cell function; cell membrane fluidity; cell membrane permeability; chemical bond; depression; drug mechanism; drug structure; elasticity; human; learning disorder; lipid membrane; lipid raft; lipid storage; lipid transport; membrane damage; membrane structure; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; physical parameters; retina; review; signal transduction; suicidal behavior; visual impairment; Animals; Apoptosis; Brain; Cell Membrane; Depressive Disorder, Major; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Humans; Membrane Lipids; Signal Transduction; Suicide",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; cholesterol, 57-88-5; docosahexaenoic acid, 25167-62-8, 32839-18-2; fish oil, 8016-13-5; phosphatidylcholine, 55128-59-1, 8002-43-5; phosphatidylethanolamine, 1405-71-6; protein kinase C, 141436-78-4; rhodopsin, 60383-01-9, 9009-81-8; sphingomyelin, 85187-10-6; Docosahexaenoic Acids, 25167-62-8; Membrane Lipids",,,"Stillwell, W., Wassall, S.R., Docosahexaenoic acid: Membrane properties of a unique fatty acid (2003) Chem.

Walnut Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States","There are conflicting reports as to whether the degree of angiogenesis as measured by microvessel density (MVD) has a prognostic value in astrocytic tumors. This may be due to the use of different antibodies against endothelial cells to highlight microvessels. It has been reported that unlike pan-endothelial antibodies, such as CD31, anti-CD105 antibodies preferentially react with endothelial cells in angiogenic tissues. To clarify the validity of anti-CD105 antibody in the evaluation of angiogenesis, we assessed MVD using an anti-CD105 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (CD105-MVD) and an anti-CD31 mAb (CD31-MVD) in a series of 50 astrocytic tumors, and correlated MVD with expression of the key angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prognosis. The mean CD31-MVD and CD105-MVD was 36.7 and 24.8 for low-grade astrocytoma (LGA), 48.0 and 42.7 for anaplastic astrocytoma, 55.3 and 51.9 for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), respectively. CD105-MVD was more closely correlated with VEGF expression than CD31-MVD. Patients with LGA and GBM showing higher CD105-MVD had a significantly shorter mean survival time (MST) than those with lower CD105-MVD tumors (P = 0.0381 and 0.0131, respectively). Whereas the MST of patients with higher CD31-MVD tumors seemed to be shorter than that of lower CD31-MVD patients within each tumor grade, the differences were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that anti-CD105 mAb may be a better marker than anti-CD31 mAb in evaluation of angiogenesis and prediction of prognosis in astrocytic tumors.","Angiogenesis; Anti-CD105 mAb; Glioma; Microvessel density; Prognosis","endoglin; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody CD105; monoclonal antibody cd31; monoclonal antibody endoglin; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; CD31 antigen; cell surface receptor; diagnostic agent; ENG protein, human; leukocyte antigen; tumor marker; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; vasculotropin A; adolescent; adult; aged; angiogenesis; article; astrocytoma; blood vessel diameter; cancer grading; clinical article; controlled study; female; glioblastoma; human; immunohistochemistry; male; microvasculature; priority journal; prognosis; protein expression; biosynthesis; brain tumor; comparative study; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; survival; survival rate; vascularization; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, CD; Antigens, CD31; Astrocytoma; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Middle Aged; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Prognosis; Receptors, Cell Surface; Survival Analysis; Survival Rate; Tumor Markers, Biological; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",,"vasculotropin, 127464-60-2; vasculotropin A, 489395-96-2; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, CD; Antigens, CD31; ENG protein, human; Receptors, Cell Surface; Tumor Markers, Biological; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",,,"Folkman, J., Angiogenesis and tumor growth (1996) N Engl J Med, 334, p. 921; Fidler, I.J., Ellis, L.M., The implications of angiogenesis for the biology and therapy of cancer metastasis (1994) Cell, 79, pp. 185-188; Fox, S.B., Gatter, K.C., Harris, A., Tumor angiogenesis (1996) J Pathol, 179, pp. 232-237; Leon, S.P., Folkerth, R.D., Black, P.M., Microvessel density is a prognostic indicator for patients with astroglial brain tumors (1996) Cancer, 77, pp. 362-372; Abdulrauf, S.I., Edvardsen, K., Ho, K.L., Yang, X.Y., Rock, J.P., Rosenblum, M.L., Vascular endothelial growth factor expression and vascular density as prognostic marker of survival in patients with low-grade astrocytoma (1998) J Neurosurg, 88, pp. 513-520; Yao, Y., Kubota, T., Sato, K., Kitai, R., Takeuchi, H., Arishima, H., Prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors flt-1 and flk-1 in astrocytic tumors (2001) Acta Neurochir, 143, pp. 159-166; Torp, S.H., Alsaker, M., Ki-67 immunoreactivity, basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) expression, and microvessel density as supplementary prognostic tools in low-grade astrocytomas.

The purpose of the current study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of initial F-18 fluorodeoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning for detection of occult lymph node and distant metastases in patients with early-stage cutaneous melanoma. METHODS. The authors conducted a prospective nonrandomized clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were patients with cutaneous melanoma tumors > 1.0 mm Breslow thickness, local disease recurrence, or solitary intransit metastases without regional lymph or distant metastases by standard clinical evaluation. All patients underwent whole-body FDG-PET scanning before surgical therapy. Abnormal PET findings were studied by targeted conventional imaging and/or biopsy. FDG-PET scans were interpreted in a blinded fashion. Regional lymph node basins were staged by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). PET scan findings in regional lymph nodes were compared with histology of SLNB specimens. Abnormal distant PET scan findings were studied with repeat conventional scan imaging at 3-6 months and were correlated with the first site(s) of clinical disease recurrence. Blinded PET scan findings were correlated with all information to determine sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS. There were 144 assessable patients with a mean tumor depth of 2.8 mm. The median follow-up for these patients was 41.4 months. Blinded interpretations of FDG-PET scan images showed that 31 patients (21%) had signs of metastatic disease, 13 patients had probable regional lymph node metastases, and 18 patients had 23 sites of possible distant metastases. SLNB and/or follow-up demonstrated regional lymph node metastases in 43 of 184 lymph node basins in 40 patients (27.8%). Compared with all clinical information, FDG-PET scan sensitivity for detection of regional lymph node metastases was 0.21 (95% confidence [CI], 0.10-0.36) and specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). No distant sites were confirmed to be true positive by targeted conventional imaging/biopsy at the time of presentation. Thirty-four patients (23.6%) presented with 54 foci of metastatic disease at initial disease recurrence. FDG-PET scan sensitivity for prediction of the first site(s) of clinical disease recurrence was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.04-0.23). Excluding patients with brain metastases, FDG-PET scan sensitivity for detection of occult Stage IV disease in patients was 0.04 (95% CI, 0.001-0.20) and specificity was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-0.92). CONCLUSIONS. FDG-PET scanning did not impact the care of patients with early-stage melanoma already staged by standard techniques. Routine FDG-PET scanning was not recommended for the initial staging evaluation in this population. © 2005 American Cancer Society.","Fluorodeoxyglucose; Lymph nodes; Melanoma; Metastases; Positron emission tomography scan","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adult; aged; article; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical trial; computer assisted emission tomography; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; female; histopathology; human; image analysis; lymph node biopsy; lymph node metastasis; lymphoscintigraphy; major clinical study; male; melanoma; metastasis; occult cancer; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sentinel lymph node; single blind procedure; skin cancer; thickness; tumor volume; validation process; Adult; Aged; Biopsy; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Melanoma; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prospective Studies; Radiopharmaceuticals; Sensitivity and Specificity; Skin Neoplasms; Tomography, Emission-Computed",,"fluorodeoxyglucose f 18, 63503-12-8; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18, 63503-12-8; Radiopharmaceuticals",,,"Balch, C.M., Buzaid, A.C., Atkins, M.B., A new American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for cutaneous melanoma (2000) Cancer, 88, pp. 1484-1491; Gershenwald, J.E., Thompson, W., Mansfield, P.F., Multi-institutional melanoma lymphatic mapping experience: The prognostic value of sentinel lymph node status in 612 stage 1 or II melanoma patients (1999) J Clin Oncol, 17, pp. 976-983; Wagner, J.D., Ranieri, J., Evdokimow, D.Z., Patterns of initial recurrence and prognosis after sentinel node biopsy and selective lymphadenectomy for melanoma (2003) Plast Reconst Surg, 112, pp. 486-497; Gritters, L.S., Francis, I.R., Zasadny, K.R., Initial assessment of positron emission tomography using 2-fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in the imaging of malignant melanoma (1993) J Nucl Med, 34, pp. 1420-1427; Boni, R., Boni, P.J.A., Steinert, H., Staging of metastatic melanoma by whole body positron emission tomography using 2-fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (1995) Br J Dermatol, 132, pp. 556-562; Wagner, J.D., Schauwecker, D., Hutchins, G., Initial assessment of positron emission tomography for detection of subclinical regional lymphatic metastases in melanoma (1997) J Surg Oncol, 64, pp. 181-189; Steinert, H.C., Boni, R.A., Buck, A., Malignant melanoma: Staging with whole body positron emission tomography and 2-(F-18)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (1995) Radiology, 195, pp. 705-709; Rinne, D., Baum, R.P., Hor, G., Primary staging and followup of high-risk melanoma patients with whole body 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, blinded, controlled trial to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide reduced the rate of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia in such infants. Methods: We randomly assigned 420 neonates, born at less than 34 weeks of gestation, with a birth weight of 401 to 1500 g, and with respiratory failure more than four hours after treatment with surfactant to receive placebo (simulated flow) or inhaled nitric oxide (5 to 10 ppm). Infants with a response (an increase in the partial pressure of arterial oxygen of more than 10 mm Hg) were weaned according to protocol. Treatment with study gas was discontinued in infants who did not have a response. Results: The rate of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 80 percent in the nitric oxide group, as compared with 82 percent in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.97; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.06; P=0.52), and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 60 percent versus 68 percent (relative risk, 0.90; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.08; P=0.26). There were no significant differences in the rates of severe intracranial hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia. Post hoc analyses suggest that rates of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are reduced for infants with a birth weight greater than 1000 g, whereas infants weighing 1000 g or less who are treated with inhaled nitric oxide have higher mortality and increased rates of severe intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions: The use of inhaled nitric oxide in critically ill premature infants weighing less than 1500 g does not decrease the rates of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Further trials are required to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide benefits infants with a birth weight of 1000 g or more.

In selected patients with one to three lesions, stereotactic radiosurgery may be used to improve local control. However, it is unclear whether whole-brain radiotherapy is necessary for all patients who are candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery. While whole-brain radiotherapy may improve the locoregional control of brain metastases, it may cause long-term side effects and may not improve overall survival in some patients. Its benefits should be evaluated in the context of risks of neurocognitive deterioration, either from whole-brain radiotherapy or from uncontrolled brain metastases, and the possible need for salvage treatments with the omission of initial whole-brain radiotherapy. For certain radioresistant brain metastases, the benefit of whole-brain radiotherapy to patients who have stereotactic radiosurgery is uncertain. © 2005 Future Drugs Ltd.","Brain metastases; Radiosurgery; Whole-brain radiotherapy","gadolinium texaphyrin; brain edema; brain metastasis; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer control; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; clinical trial; cognitive defect; gamma knife radiosurgery; histopathology; human; patient selection; radiation injury; radiation necrosis; radiosensitivity; review; risk assessment; seizure; stereotaxic surgery; treatment indication; Brain Neoplasms; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Radiosurgery",,"gadolinium texaphyrin, 165254-24-0, 194083-75-5",,,"Cairncross, J.G., Kim, J.H., Posner, J.B., Radiation therapy for brain metastases (1980) Ann.

The outbreak initially was limited to the northeast but has since spread across the entire continental United States. WNV causes a variety of clinical symptoms, but the most severe consequences result from central nervous system infection, resulting in meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis. We present a case of a 62-year-old male with metastatic cancer, who died as a result of WNV encephalitis. This is followed by a discussion on the epidemiology of WNV and a detailed summary of the methods and resources available to make a diagnosis of WNV infection postmortem. The material presented in the discussion should provide the forensic pathologist with all the information necessary to make a diagnosis of WNV infection postmortem. If nothing else, the routine collection and storage of serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue for every case can enable the forensic pathologist to make this diagnosis even in cases in which WNV is not suspected until after autopsy.

Objective: To examine mortality rates, duration of survival, causes of death, and the contribution of AD to the risk of mortality in an aging community-based cohort, controlling for other predictors. Design: Fifteen-year prospective epidemiological study. Mortality rates per 1000 person-years and the population-attributable risk of mortality were determined. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risk of mortality due to AD, adjusting for relevant covariates. Death certificates were abstracted for listed causes of death. Setting: A largely blue-collar rural community in south-western Pennsylvania. Participants: A community-based cohort of 1670 adults 65 years and older at study enrollment. Main Outcome Measure: Mortality. Results: In the overall cohort, AD was a significant predictor of mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1.4 after adjusting for covariates. The population-attributable risk of mortality from AD was 4.9% based on the same model. Examining the sexes separately, AD increased mortality risk only among women. Death certificates of AD subjects were more likely to list dementia/AD, other brain disorders, pneumonia, and dehydration, and less likely to include cancer. Conclusions: Alzheimer disease was responsible for 4.9% of the deaths in this elderly cohort. Alzheimer disease increased the risk of mortality 40% in the cohort as a whole and separately in women but not in men. The mean (SD) duration of survival with AD was 5.9 (3.7) years, and longer with earlier age at onset.",,"aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; brain disease; cancer; cause of death; cohort analysis; controlled study; covariance; death certificate; dehydration; dementia; epidemiological data; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; onset age; pneumonia; priority journal; prospective study; survival time; United States; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Analysis of Variance; Cohort Studies; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Rate",,,,,"Katzman, R., Karasu, T.B., Differential diagnosis of dementia (1975) Neurological and Sensory Disorders of the Elderly, pp. 103-134. , Fields W, ed.

We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of giving preirradiation chemotherapy followed by 1800 cGy CSI to young children with localized medulloblastoma. Methods and materials Between January 1993 and July 1997, 7 consecutive patients (age, 20-64 months) with M0 medulloblastoma were enrolled. After surgical resection, patients received 4 months of multiagent chemotherapy followed by 1800 cGy CSI and 5400 cGy to the posterior fossa. Results Median follow-up is 8.9 years. No patient developed progressive disease during chemotherapy. One patient developed widespread metastatic recurrence 2 months after completing radiation therapy and died. Two additional patients developed isolated frontal horn relapses 32 and 36 months after initial diagnosis and received further irradiation and chemotherapy. Both of these patients remain alive 7.1 and 3.6 years from the time of recurrence. Four of the six survivors have endocrine deficits. All of the survivors require special assistance in school. Conclusions Craniospinal irradiation doses of 1800 cGy may not be adequate to prevent exoprimary recurrences. Despite the CSI dose reduction, neuroendocrine and neurocognitive sequelae are substantial. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.","Chemotherapy; Craniospinal; Medulloblastoma; Radiation therapy","Diagnosis; Diseases;

Box 60012, Arcadia, CA, United States","Purpose: To report the results of the first pharmacokinetic study in pediatric patients of O6-benzylguanine (O6BG), which irreversibly inactivates the DNA repair protein alkylguanine-alkyltransferase, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of nitrosoureas. Experimental Design: As part of a Pediatric Oncology Group Phase I study, 120 mg/m2 of O 6BG was administered i.v. over 1 h, before 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1- nitrosourea administration in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors. Serial blood samples for plasma pharmacokinetic studies were obtained. Concentrations of O6BG and its active metabolite O 6-benzyl-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-O6BG) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. A pharmacokinetic model and additional first-order elimination rate constants for each compound were developed. Results: O6BG concentration versus time data were evaluated for 25 patients. The peak concentration of O6BG (mean ± SD) was 11 ± 4 μM, and the peak concentration of its active metabolite, 8-oxo-O6BG, was 35 ± 10 μM. O6BG was rapidly eliminated with a half-life of 85 ± 140 min, area under the curve of 795 ± 320 μM · min and clearance of 760 ± 400 ml/min/m 2. The area under the curve of 8-oxo-O6BG when extrapolated to infinity was 22,700 ± 11,800 μM · min. The clearance and terminal half-life of 8-oxo-O6BG were 30 ± 15 ml/min/m2 and 360 ± 220 min, respectively. Conclusions: There is rapid elimination of O6BG after i.v. administration over 1 h. In contrast, the terminal half-life for the active metabolite, 8-oxo-O 6BG, is 4-fold longer. The pharmacokinetic parameters for O 6BG and 8-oxo-O6BG are similar to those reported previously in adults.",,"6 o alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase; 6 o benzylguanine; carmustine; drug metabolite; guanine derivative;

Early tumor treatment should be given to patients with newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas who are over age 50 years, those who have headaches or neurologic deficits other than seizures, or those whose neuroimaging studies show tumor growth or mass effect. For younger patients presenting with seizures and no other neurologic symptoms, it is reasonable to defer therapy until there is clinical or radiographic tumor progression. When it is judged that intervention is necessary, patients should undergo to maximal surgical tumor resection, which preserves or improves neurologic function. For younger (<50 years) astrocytoma patients with a good tumor resection, radiation may be deferred until tumor progression. Early radiation should be given to astrocytoma patients who are older than 50 years of age at diagnosis (regardless of the type of surgery) or to younger patients who are judged to require early intervention but who are not candidates for aggressive surgical resection. The radiation dose for low-grade glioma should be 4500 to 5000 cGy, preferably with three-dimensional conformal ports. The same guidelines for management apply to patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma, except that chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative to radiation when it is judged that treatment other than surgical resection is required.

Integral to adequate radiation therapy delivery is the appropriate determination of tumor volume and extent at the time treatment is being delivered. As a matter of routine practice, radiation therapy treatment fields are designed based on tumor volumes evident on pre-operative or immediate post-operative MRIs; another MRI is generally not obtained for planning boost fields. In some instances the time interval from surgery to radiotherapy initiation is up to 5 weeks and the boost or ""cone-down phase"" commences 4-5 weeks later. The contrast enhanced T1 MRI may not be a totally reliable indicator of active tumor, especially in regions where such blood-brain barrier breakdown has not occurred. Moreover, these volumes may change during the course of treatment. This may lead to a geographic miss when mid-treatment boost volumes are designed based on a pre-radiotherapy MRI. The goal of this study is to examine how a mid-treatment MRI impacts the delineation and definition of the boost volume in GBM patients in comparison to the pre-treatment MRI scan, particularly when the tumor-specific agent Motexafin-Gadolinium is used.","Glioblastoma treatment planning; Motexafin gadolinium; Target volumes","gadolinium texaphyrin; article; blood brain barrier; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical article; contrast enhancement; disease activity; drug specificity; glioblastoma; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; treatment planning; tumor volume; Brain Neoplasms; Clinical Trials; Combined Modality Therapy; Contrast Media; Glioblastoma; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Metalloporphyrins; Postoperative Period; Radiotherapy; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Tumor Burden",,"gadolinium texaphyrin, 165254-24-0, 194083-75-5; Contrast Media; Metalloporphyrins; motexafin gadolinium",,,"Leibel, S.A., Scott, C.B., Loeffler, J.S., Contemporary approaches to the treatment of malignant gliomas with radiation therapy (1994) Seminars in Oncology, 21, pp. 198-219; Kelly, P.J., Daumas-Duport, C., Scheithauer, B.W., Stereotactic histologic correlations of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging-defined abnormalities in patients with glial neoplasms (1987) Mayo Clinic Proceedings, 62, pp. 450-459; Masukado, Y.M.C., Kernohan, J.W., The growth of glioblastoma multiforme (astrocytoma grades 3 and 4) in neurosurgical practice (1961) J.

The precision for irradiations performed with standard radiotherapy equipment is ±2 mm in each dimension, and is adequate for most human treatment applications. For small animals such as rodents, whose organs and tissue structures may be an order of magnitude smaller than those of humans, the corresponding precision required is closer to ±0.2 mm, if comparisons or extrapolations are to be made to human data. The Leksell Gamma Knife is a high precision radiosurgery irradiator, with precision in each dimension not exceeding 0.5 mm, and overall precision of 0.7 mm. It has recently been utilized to treat ocular melanoma and induce targeted lesions in the brains of small animals. This paper describes the dosimetry and a technique for performing irradiation of a single rat eye and lens with the Gamma Knife while allowing the contralateral eye and lens of the same rat to serve as the ""control"". The dosimetry was performed with a phantom in vitro utilizing a pinpoint ion chamber and thermoluminescent dosimeters, and verified by Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the contralateral eye received less than 5% of the administered dose for a 15 Gy exposure to the targeted eye. In addition, after 15 Gy irradiation 15 out of 16 animals developed cataracts in the irradiated target eyes, while 0 out of 16 contralateral eyes developed cataracts over a 6-month period of observation. Experiments at 5 and 10 Gy also confirmed the lack of cataractogenesis in the contralateral eye. Our results validate the use of the Gamma Knife for cataract studies in rodents, and confirmed the precision and utility of the instrument as a small animal irradiator for translational radiobiology experiments.","Cataractogenesis; Cataracts; Radiation","animal experiment; animal model; article; cancer radiotherapy; cataract; cataractogenesis; controlled study; dosimetry; gamma knife; gamma knife radiosurgery; irradiation; linear accelerator; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; rat; thermoluminescence; tumor localization; Animals; Cataract Extraction; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lens, Crystalline; Radiation Dosage; Radiosurgery; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",,,,,"Emami, B., Lyman, J., Brown, A., Coia, L., Tolerance of Normal Tissue to Therapeutic Irradiation (1991) Int.

Michigan Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States","Background: Chronic illness in a family member can cause emotional distress throughout the family, and may impair the family's ability to support the patient. Objectives: We compare the familial impact of mental illness to other common chronic conditions. We examine the impact of a person's chronic illness on the psychological health of all persons in his or her family and identify both individual and family-level risk factors associated with psychological spillovers. Methods: Our analysis is based on data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) that, because of its sample design, can be used to model both individual and family health status. Psychological distress is measured using responses to the general mental health question for each family member. The chronic conditions considered include cancer, diabetes, stroke-related disorders, arthritis, asthma, and mental illness (including dementia). We estimate the relationships of interest using a semi-parametric method, the discrete random effects probit model. Results: Brain-related conditions, including mental illness, impose the most significant risk to the psychological well-being of family members. The effects of the other chronic conditions studied, while not as significant, are notable in that their negative impacts on the psychological health of family members are sometimes larger than their direct psychological impacts on the patient. Economic distress not only directly increases the chance that an individual will experience emotional distress, but it appears it also reduces the family's ability as a whole to cope psychologically with chronic illness. Discussion: Our analysis suffers from problems common to all cross-sectional designs, although the impact of selection bias appeared to be small in sensitivity analysis. While health conditions were based on unverified self-reports, condition categories were broadly defined to reduce the required precision of such reports.",,"accuracy; adult; arthritis; article; asthma; brain disease; cancer; child; chronic disease; controlled study; coping behavior; data analysis; dementia; diabetes mellitus; distress syndrome; emotional stress; family health; health care cost; health economics; health status; health survey; human; major clinical study; medical parameters; mental disease; mental health; nonbiological model; psychological aspect; questionnaire; randomization; risk assessment; risk factor; self report; sensitivity analysis; stroke; wellbeing; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family; Family Health; Family Relations; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; United States",,,,,"Lowery, K., Mynt, P., Aisbett, J., Dixon, T., O'Brien, J., Ballard, C., Depression in the carers of dementia sufferers: A comparison of the carers of patients suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies and the carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (2000) J.

DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A 20-year-old woman with a 5-year history of Crohn disease presented with a 2-week history of headache and blurred vision in both eyes. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. Fluorescein angiography showed a profound delay in retinal and choroidal perfusion. Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 320 mm water. Therapy was initiated with oral acetazolamide 750 mg per day. RESULTS: A subjective improvement of symptoms was noted over 4 days. Repeat fluorescein angiography showed resolution of the ocular perfusion deficit. No recurrent symptoms were noted 19 months after cessation of therapy.

Our objective was to determine if subacute treatment with combined antioxidants quercetin and coenzyme Q10 (10 mg/kg/day ip for 14 days) affects the activities of antioxidant enzymes in normal and 30-day streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. Quercetin treatment raised blood glucose concentrations in normal and diabetic rats, whereas treatment with coenzyme Q10 did not. Liver, kidney, heart, and brain tissues were excised and the activities of catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and concentrations of oxidized and reduced glutathione were determined. In the liver of diabetic rats, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and levels of both oxidized and reduced glutathione were significantly decreased from the non-diabetic control, and these effects were not reversed when antioxidants were administered. In kidney, glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly elevated in the diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats, and antioxidant treatment did not return the enzyme activity to nondiabetic levels. In heart, catalase activity was increased in diabetic animals and restored to normal levels after combined treatment with quercetin and coenzyme Q10. Cardiac superoxide dismutase was lower than normal in quercetin- and quercetin + coenzyme Q10-treated diabetic rats. There were no adverse effects on oxidative stress markers after treatment with quercetin or coenzyme Q10 singly or in combination. In spite of the elevation of glucose, quercetin may be effective in reversing some effects of diabetes, but the combination of quercetin + coenzyme Q10 did not increase effectiveness in reversing effects of diabetes. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Surgery or radiation therapy alone resulted in few cures since these techniques utilize a local therapy for a disseminated disease. Chemotherapy remains the backbone of treatment for all patients with SCLC, regardless of stage. For patients with limited-stage disease (LD), the addition of thoracic radiation to chemotherapy is standard. The optimal timing, dose, and schedule of radiation remains undefined. The majority of studies demonstrate equivalent or superior survival for early radiation when compared to delayed radiation. Approximately 50% of patients with LD will achieve a complete remission with chemoradiation and will be candidates for prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). While phase III trials have failed to demonstrate a statistically significant survival for PCI, brain relapse is clearly reduced, and a metaanalysis reports a small long-term survival advantage favoring patients receiving PCI. Unfortunately, unlike LD SCLC, advances in extensive-stage disease have been elusive, despite the testing of numerous strategies. Four courses of cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus etoposide remain standard first-line therapy. Promising results have been seen with irinotecan/cisplatin, but confirmatory trials are still needed. A plateau has been reached with chemotherapy regimens, and novel strategies are greatly needed to improve survival for patients with SCLC.","Carboplatin; Chemoradiation; Cisplatin; Etoposide; Irinotecan; Prophylactic cranial irradiation; Topotecan","carboplatin; carmustine; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; DNA topoisomerase inhibitor; doxorubicin; epirubicin; etoposide; gastrin releasing peptide; gemcitabine; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; herbimycin A; ifosfamide; imatinib; irinotecan; lomustine; marimastat; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; methotrexate; monoclonal antibody; navelbine; paclitaxel; platelet derived growth factor; platinum; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; somatomedin; stem cell factor receptor; taxane derivative; topotecan; unindexed drug; vincristine; advanced cancer; brain metastasis; brain radiation; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer regression; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical trial; continuous infusion; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diarrhea; disseminated cancer; dose response; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug response; drug tolerability; hematologic disease; human; long term care; lung small cell cancer; lung surgery; maintenance therapy; meta analysis; neutropenia; radiation dose; review; standard; statistical analysis",,,"gleevec",,"Greenlee, R.T., Hill-Harmon, M., Murray, T., Cancer Statistics 2001 (2001) CA Cancer J.

This suggests a functional screen for transforming genes is required to identify genetic mutations that are missed by cytogenetic analyses. We utilized a retrovirus-based cDNA expression system to identify transforming genes expressed in cytogenetically normal AML patients. We identified a new member of the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, designating it RasGRP4. Subsequently, cDNA sequences encoding rodent and human RasGRP4 proteins were deposited in GenBank™. RasGRP4 contains the same protein domain structure as other members of the RasGRP family, including a Ras exchange motif, a CDC25 homology domain, a C1/diacyglycerol-binding domain, and putative calcium-binding EF hands. We show that expression of RasGRP4 induces anchorage-independent growth of Rat1 fibroblasts. RasGRP4 is a Ras-specific activator and, interestingly, is highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and myeloid cell lines. Unlike other RasGRP proteins, RasGRP4 is not expressed in the brain or in lymphoid cells. We demonstrated that 32D myeloid cells expressing RasGRP4 have elevated levels of activated Ras compared with control cells, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment greatly enhanced Ras activation. PMA induced membrane localization of RasGRP4 and 32D cells expressing RasGRP4 were capable of cytokine-independent proliferation in the presence of PMA. We conclude that RasGRP4 is a member of the RasGRP family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors that may play a role in myeloid cell signaling growth regulation pathways that are responsive to diacylglycerol levels.",,"Brain; DNA sequences; Genes; Mutations; Biochemistry; diacylglycerol; gene product; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; Ras guanyl nucleotide releasing protein 4; Ras protein; unclassified drug; acute granulocytic leukemia; article; brain cell; cancer cell culture; carboxy terminal sequence; cell growth; cell proliferation; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytogenetics; gene activation; gene expression; gene mutation; gene sequence; gene structure; genetic code; growth regulation; human; human cell; nucleotide sequence; oncogene ras; priority journal; protein domain; protein motif; sequence analysis; sequence homology; signal transduction; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Cytokines; Genes, ras; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; Humans; Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute; Molecular Sequence Data; ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; Rats; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate; Rodentia; unidentified retrovirus","GENBANK: AF448437","Cytokines; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; RASGRP4 protein, human; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate, 16561-29-8",,,"Miller, K.B., (1995) Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice, pp. 993-1014. , (Hoffman, R., Benz, E.

Patients and methods: Patients with extensive SCLC with a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) ≥50, adequate renal function and bone marrow reserve were eligible. Patients with CNS metastasis were eligible and received concurrent whole-brain radiotherapy. All patients received etoposide 75 mg/m2, ifosfamide 1.2 g/m2 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1-4 every 3 weeks for four cycles. Non-progressing patients were randomized to oral etoposide 50 mg/m2 for 21 consecutive days every 4 weeks for three courses versus no further therapy until progression. Results: From September 1993 to June 1998, 233 patients were entered and treated with VIP with 144 non-progressing patients subsequently randomized to oral etoposide (n = 72) or observation (n = 72). Minimum follow up for all patients is 2 years. Toxicity with oral etoposide was mild. There was an improvement in median PFS favoring the maintenance arm of 8.23 versus 6.5 months (P = 0.0018). There was a trend towards an improvement in median (12.2 versus 11.2 months), 1-year (51.4% versus 40.3%), 2-year (16.7% versus 6.9%) and 3-year (9.1% versus 1.9%) survival (P = 0.0704) favoring the maintenance arm. Conclusions: Three months of oral etoposide in non-progressing patients with extensive SCLC was associated with a significant improvement in PFS and a trend towards improved overall survival.","Lung cancer; Maintenance; Small cell; VIP","cisplatin; etoposide; ifosfamide; mesna; adult; aged; alopecia; article; blood toxicity; bone marrow; cancer growth; cancer survival; cardiotoxicity; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; kidney function; liver toxicity; lung small cell cancer; lung toxicity; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; metastasis; nausea; neurotoxicity; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; statistical analysis; stomatitis; Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Small Cell; Cisplatin; Disease Progression; Etoposide; Female; Humans; Ifosfamide; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Survival Rate; Time Factors",,"Cisplatin, 15663-27-1; Etoposide, 33419-42-0; Ifosfamide, 3778-73-2",,,"Greenlee, R.T., Murray, T., Buldea, S., Cancer Statistics, 2000 (2000) CA Cancer J.

Methods: A total of 1207 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to a reference regimen of cisplatin and paclitaxel or to one of three experimental regimens: cisplatin and gemcitabine, cisplatin and docetaxel, or carboplatin and paclitaxel. Results: The response rate for all 1155 eligible patients was 19 percent, with a median survival of 7.9 months (95 percent confidence interval, 7.3 to 8.5), a 1-year survival rate of 33 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 30 to 36 percent), and a 2-year survival rate of 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8 to 12 percent). The response rate and survival did not differ significantly between patients assigned to receive cisplatin and paclitaxel and those assigned to receive any of the three experimental regimens. Treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine was associated with a significantly longer time to the progression of disease than was treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel but was more likely to cause grade 3, 4, or 5 renal toxicity (in 9 percent of patients, vs. 3 percent of those treated with cisplatin plus paclitaxel). Patients with a performance status of 2 had a significantly lower rate of survival than did those with a performance status of 0 or 1. Conclusions: None of four chemotherapy regimens offered a significant advantage over the others in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

The tumor was embedded in the medial aspect of the left frontal lobe and was not attached to any of the bones of the skull. At surgery, the tumor was lightly adherent to the falx and was easily extracted. Histologically, the tumor was composed of mononuclear spindle-shaped and ovoid stromal cells, multinuclear giant cells containing 20-30 nuclei, and foci of osteoid and bone production. Hemorrhagic and cystic areas were also present within the tumor. Ultrastructurally, the spindle-shaped cells resembled fibroblasts and were surrounded by small bundles of collagen fibrils. The ovoid cells contained numerous mitochondria, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, vesicles, lysosomes, phagosomes and osseous material in the cytoplasm suggesting their monocyte-macrophage lineage. These cells were closely apposed and displayed evidence of fusion in the form of focal and linear subplasmalemmal densities to form multinucleated giant cells with similar organelles and multiple nuclei. It is suggested that the primary giant cell tumor of the bone arose from the metaplastic ossification of the falx. To our knowledge, a giant-cell tumor of bone arising from the falx cerebri has not been previously described.","Falx cerebri; Giant cells; Lysosomes; Mononuclear cells; Phagosomes; Subplasmalemmal densities","collagen fibril; adult; article; bone tumor; brain; brain falx; cancer surgery; case report; cell density; cell fusion; cell lineage; cell nucleus; cell organelle; cell shape; cell ultrastructure; cell vacuole; cytoplasm; fibroblast; frontal lobe; giant cell; giant cell tumor; histology; human; human tissue; lysosome; macrophage; male; mitochondrion; monocyte; mononuclear cell; ossification; osteoid; phagosome; rough endoplasmic reticulum; skull; differential diagnosis; dura mater; heterotopic ossification; meningioma; osteoclastoma; pathology; ultrastructure; Adult; Diagnosis, Differential; Dura Mater; Frontal Lobe; Giant Cell Tumor of Bone; Humans; Male; Meningeal Neoplasms; Ossification, Heterotopic",,,,,"Batnitzky, S., Powers, J.M., Schechter, M.M., Falx 'calcification' - Does this exist?

It is also fair to state that there has been progress in developing new types of chemotherapy and other agents, in devising new treatment strategies, and in gaining a deeper understanding of the problems that must be overcome to treat patients with anaplastic gliomas successfully. The past several years have seen the realization that oligodendroglioma, primary CNS lymphoma, and medulloblastoma are sensitive to chemotherapy treatments.

Background: Medulloblastoma is a common childhood primary brain tumor. Potential prognostic indicators for patients with local disease are age, extent of resection, and gender. However, none of these are well established. Immunohistologic staining is a potentially useful means to identify high-risk patients. The purpose of this clinical pathologic study was to investigate the prognostic significance of GFAP, synaptophysin, Ki-67, and p53 immunostaining in medulloblastoma/central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS PNETs). Materials and methods: The records of 40 patients with CNS PNETs were reviewed. Their surgical specimens were immunostained for p53, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synaptophysin, and Ki-67. The p53 specimens were scored blindly for the intensity of staining of nuclei (intense vs weak) and the quantity of cells stained. The Ki-67, GFAP, and synaptophysin specimens were analyzed for quantity of cells stained. Results: Ten patients' specimens stained intensely for the p53 protein. Eleven had weakly staining nuclei. Nineteen specimens had no staining. The patients with specimens that stained intensely had a statistically significant decreased disease free survival (P = 0.03). Mere presence or quantity of p53 nuclear staining did not correlate with disease free survival. Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67, GFAP, and synaptophysin did not correlate with disease free survival. Clinical parameters of age, gender, and extent of resection also did not approach statistical significance for disease free survival. Conclusion: Intense nuclear staining for p53 was the only variable in this clinical pathologic study that reached statistical significance for disease free survival. This suggests that intense staining for p53 may be the most important prognostic indicator for non-metastatic CNS PNETs. p53 Immunostaining with antibodies against p53 in CNS PNETs should be studied in a multi-institutional setting with larger numbers of patients.","Glial fibrillary acidic protein;

Methods to rapidly elucidate gene function will have increasing value in these investigations. The use of model organisms in functional genomics has begun to be recognized and exploited and is one example of the emerging use of the tools of developmental biology in recent drug discovery efforts. The use of protein products expressed during embryogenesis and the use of certain pluripotent cell populations (stem cells) as candidate therapeutics are other applications of developmental biology to the treatment of human diseases. These agents may be used to repair damaged or diseased tissues by inducing or directing developmental programs that recapitulate embryonic processes to replace specialized cells. The activation or silencing of embryonic genes in the disease state, particularly those encoding transcription factors, is another avenue of exploitation. Finally, the direct drug-induced manipulation of embryonic development is a unique application of developmental biology in animal agriculture.","Developmental biology; Drug discovery; Embryonic proteins; Functional genomics; Model organisms; Stem cells","bone morphogenetic protein 2; brain derived neurotrophic factor; erythropoietin; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; growth differentiation factor 1; growth differentiation factor 9; growth factor; interleukin 11; interleukin 12; keratinocyte growth factor; myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 1; osteogenic protein 1; protein; recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor; recombinant erythropoietin; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; recombinant interleukin 11; recombinant stem cell factor; sonic hedgehog protein; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; agriculture; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; animal experiment; animal model; bone disease; cancer; cell damage; cell transplantation; clinical trial; developmental biology; DNA sequence; drug development; embryo development; gene function; genome; hepatitis; human; infertility; kidney failure; mucosa inflammation; multiple sclerosis; muscle atrophy; neurologic disease; neutropenia; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; review; thrombocytopenia; vascular disease; Agriculture; Animals; Developmental Biology; Drug Industry; Embryo; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Growth Substances; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Nuclear Proteins",,"Growth Substances; Nuclear Proteins","epogen, Amgen; fiblast, Scios; neumega, Genetics Institute; neupogen, Amgen; stemgen, Amgen","Amgen; Biogen; Cambridge Neuroscience; Creative Biomolecules; Genentech; Genetics Institute; Human Genome Sciences; Metamorphix; Ontogeny; Regeneron; Scios; Stryker; Wyeth Ayerst","Drews, J., Ryser, S., (1997) Drug Discovery Today, 2, p. 365; Hillier, L.D., Lennon, G., Becker, M., Bonaldo, M.F., Chiapelli, B., Chissoe, S., Dietrich, N., Gish, W., (1996) Genome Res, 6, p. 8; Velculescu, V.E., Zhang, L., Vogelstein, B., Kinzler, K.W., (1995) Science, 270, p. 484; Stipp, D., (1997) Fortune, p. 56. , March; Schena, M., Shalon, D., Davis, R.W., Brown, P.O., (1995) Science, 270, p. 467; Winzeler, E.A., Richards, D.R., Conway, A.R., Goldstein, A.L., Kalman, S., McCullough, M.J., McCusker, J.H., Davis, R.W., (1998) Science, 281, p. 1; Ehrenstein, D., (1997) Science, 277, p. 762; Aldridge, S., (1998) Genetic Engineering News, 18, p. 8; Fields, S., (1997) Nature Genetics, 15, p. 3; Spence, P., (1998) Drug Discovery Today, 3, p. 1; Rastan, S., Beeley, L.J., (1997) Curr.

Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urothelium has limitations, and new therapies need to be evaluated. METHODS. Ifosfamide 1.0 gm/m2 on Days 1-4 and paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 by 24-hour infusion on Day 4 were administered to 26 patients with locally unresectable or metastatic TCC. Cycles were repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles; dose escalation was dependent on whether Grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred. RESULTS. There were 24 males and 2 females, with a median age of 66 years and a median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0. The median number of cycles administered was 3. Twelve patients had Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities, including 1 patient who died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage while pancytopenic. There were no episodes of neutropenic fever. Two patients each had a complete response (CR) that lasted 5 and 28 months, respectively (response rate: 15%; 95% CI: 2-45%), among the 13 patients who had received prior chemotherapy. Of the 13 patients without prior chemotherapy, there were 3 with complete responses and 1 with a partial response ranging from 8 to 25+ months (RR: 30.7%; 95% CI: 9-61%). CONCLUSIONS. The combination of ifosfamide and paclitaxel is well tolerated and can produce objective responses in patients who are chemonaive or have had prior therapy. For previously untreated patients, the addition of ifosfamide does not appear to result in a better response rate than single agent paclitaxel; and for previously treated patients, the addition of paclitaxel does not appear to result in a better response rate than single agent ifosfamide.","Ifosfamide;

Vertebrate development is constrained into only very few final or common developmental paths; therefore, no developmental anomaly seen in humans is unique to ('pathognomonic' of) one syndrome. Thus, it is not surprising that prenatal overgrowth occurs in several syndromes, including the Sotos and Weaver syndromes. Are they sufficiently different in other respects to allow the postulation of locus (rather than allele) heterogeneity? Phenotypic data in both conditions are biased because of ascertainment of propositi, and the apparent differences between them may be entirely artificial as they were between the G and BBB syndromes. On the other hand, the Sotos syndrome may be a cancer syndrome, the Weaver syndrome not (though a neuroblastoma was reported in the latter); in the former there is also remarkably advanced dental maturation rarely commented on in the latter. In Weaver syndrome there are more conspicuous contractures and a facial appearance that experts find convincingly different from that of Sotos individuals. Nevertheless, the hypothesis of locus heterogeneity is testable; at the moment we are inclined to favor the hypothesis of allele heterogeneity. An international effort is required to map, isolate, and sequence the causal gene or genes.","Autosomal dominant inheritance; Heterogeneity; Nosology; Sotos syndrome; Weaver syndrome","autosomal dominant inheritance; case report; child; conference paper; disease classification; genetic counseling; genetic disorder; human; multiple malformation syndrome; phenotype; priority journal; sotos syndrome; syndrome delineation; weaver syndrome; Brain; Female; Fetal Macrosomia; Genes, Dominant; Genetic Counseling; Growth Disorders; Humans; Infant; Male; Syndrome; Vertebrata",,,,,"Allanson, J.E., Cole, T.R.P., Sotos syndrome: Evolution of facial phenotype.

Methods. To measure PLC activity in the plasma membrane fraction a standard isotopic method was developed using exogenous PIP2 as substrate. PLC activity was linear with time for 2.5 min and proportional with protein concentrations over a range of 5 to 29 μg per 50 μl reaction mixture. Results. The apparent K(m) for PIP2 was 0.3 mM in both normal liver and rapidly growing hepatoma 3924A. PLC activity in adult rat liver was 747 and 986 nmol/h/mg protein; it increased 1.7- to 2.1-fold in hepatomas of slow an intermediate growth rates and 3.7-fold in rapidly growing hepatoma 3924A. By contrast, no significant difference was observed between 24 hours regenerating and sham-operated livers. PLC activity was high in thymus, spleen, testis, bone marrow, lung, brain, heart and renal cortex, but in the same range in skeletal muscle and liver. PLC has a relatively long half-life as there were no significant changes in PLC specific activity in bone marrow during the 9 hour period after intraperitoneal injection of the protein biosynthetic inhibitor, cycloheximide. PLC was subject to nutritional regulation because at 3 days' starvation the specific activity in rat bone marrow decreased to 78% of control values and recovered after 1-day refeeding. Conclusion: The results indicate that PLC is a transformation- and progression-linked signal transduction enzyme. This work and recent studies showing increased 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (EC 2.7.1.67) and 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-5-kinase (EC 2.7.1.68) provide evidence of a gain in function for a markedly elevated capacity of signal transduction sequence in transplantable rat hepatomas of different growth rates. Inhibition of the activities of kinases and PLC may provide sensitive targets for selective cancer therapy by down-regulating the up-regulated signal transduction cascade.","Enzyme half-life; Hepatomas; Phospholipase C; Regenerating liver","cycloheximide; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; phosphatidylinositol kinase; phosphodiesterase; phospholipase c; protein synthesis inhibitor; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bone marrow; brain; cancer chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer transplantation; cell membrane; cell proliferation; cell transformation; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; enzyme localization; enzyme substrate; half life time; heart; kidney cortex; liver cell carcinoma; liver regeneration; lung; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; spleen; starvation; testis; thymus; Animals; Bone Marrow; Cell Division; Cycloheximide; Liver; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Liver Regeneration; Male; Organ Specificity; Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase; Phospholipase C; Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Rats; Rats, Inbred ACI; Rats, Inbred BUF; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction",,"1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase, EC 3.1.4.11; 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, EC 2.7.1.68; Cycloheximide, 66-81-9; Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase, EC 4.6.1.13; Phospholipase C, EC 3.1.4.3; Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases, EC 3.1.4.-; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), EC 2.7.1.-",,,"Weber, G., Biochemical strategy of cancer cells and the design of chemotherapy: GHA Clowes Memorial Lecture (1983) Cancer Res, 43, pp. 3466-3492; Tricot, G., Jayaram, H.N., Weber, G., Huffman, R., Tiazofurin: Biological effects and clinical uses (1990) Intl J Cell Cloning, 8, pp. 161-170; Tricot, G., Weber, G., Biochemically targeted therapy of refractory leukemia and myeloid blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia with tiazofurin.

Aff. Med. C., Indianapolis, IN, United States","Purpose: To assess the response of patients with recurrent malignant gliomas to intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin. Methods: Eligibility criteria included patients with recurrent supratentorial malignant gliomas and measurable, unilateral contrast-enhancing tumor located within the territory of one or two major cerebral arteries. Patients received 75 mg/m2 IA cisplatin every four weeks. Depending on individual patients' tumor topography, cisplatin was infused either into the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) (15 patients), or into one or two major cerebral arteries (26 patients), most often the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. Results: Of 40 patients evaluable for tumor response, four patients (10%) were responders and nine patients (22%) had disease stabilization. The median time to tumor progression among the 13 patients with tumor response or stable disease was 23.7 weeks. The response rate did not significantly differ between patients receiving ICA versus selective intracerebral infusion, although the latter group contained a higher proportion of glioblastoma. Tumor progression occurred solely as local failure in 33 patients (82%), with all enhancing tumor still located within the vascular territory infused with IA cisplatin. Ipsilateral vision loss occurred in two patients after ICA cisplatin but in none of the selective infusion patients. Seizures and/or transient or permanent neurologic deterioration occurred in four patients (27%) after ICA cisplatin and in 11 patients (44%) after selective intracerebral infusion. Conclusions: Although this was not a randomized comparison, selective intracerebral artery cisplatin infusion in this group of patients reduced the risk of eye toxicity, but did not produce a better tumor response rate, and carried a higher risk of neurotoxicity relative to ICA infusion.","Cisplatin; Glioma","antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; adult; article; blood toxicity; brain artery; cancer recurrence; clinical article; clinical trial; drug efficacy; glioblastoma; human; internal carotid artery; intraarterial drug administration; intracerebral drug administration; neurologic disease; neurotoxicity; phase 2 clinical trial; seizure; visual impairment; Adult; Carotid Arteries; Cerebral Arteries; Cisplatin; Glioma; Humans; Infusions, Intra-Arterial; Injections, Intra-Arterial; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Supratentorial Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome",,"Cisplatin, 15663-27-1",,"bristol","Dropcho, E.J., Intra-arterial chemotherapy for malignant gliomas Textbook of Gliomas, , Berger MS, Wilson CB (eds) W.B.

The purpose of this study was to determine the survival outcome for patients whose anaplastic gliomas began as low-grade tumors compared with patients with de novo high- grade gliomas. Seventy-seven (11.5%) of 667 patients with anaplastic gliomas consecutively treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham had histologically proven prior low-grade tumors. As a group, the patients with prior low-grade tumors would be expected to have a relatively favorable outcome, as they were younger and had a lower proportion of glioblastoma multiforme than the patients with de novo anaplastic gliomas. To provide a valid comparison, we performed a matched case-control study. We matched 68 patients from the prior low-grade group one-to-one with patients from the de hove group for tumor histology, age, Karnofsky performance scores, and type of surgery, without knowledge of outcome. The two groups received comparable radiotherapy and chemotherapy. For the 68 patients with prior low-grade tumor, median actuarial survival from the time of diagnosis of malignant degeneration was 19.7 months and the 5-year survival rate was 22%, compared with 22.0 months and 28% for the 68 matched de novo patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the two groups did not significantly differ (p = 0.24 by logrank test). There were no significant survival differences between the patient subsets of prior low-grade versus de hove with glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, or anaplastic oligodendroglioma/mixed anaplastic glioma. These data indicate that with currently available treatment options, the survival outlook for patients with anaplastic gliomas, whose tumors arose from transformation of low-grade gliomas, is equivalent to the prognosis for patients with de hove anaplastic gliomas.",,"antineoplastic agent; carmustine; cisplatin; diaziquone; hydroxyurea; lomustine; mercaptopurine; nitrosourea; procarbazine; vincristine; adult; aged; article; astrocytoma; cancer grading; cancer survival; case control study; central nervous system tumor; glioblastoma; glioma; histology; human; intraarterial drug administration; major clinical study; malignant transformation; oligodendroglioma; priority journal; prognosis; Adolescent; Adult; Brain Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Glioblastoma; Humans; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Survival Analysis",,,,,"Muller, W., Afra, D., Schröder, R., Supratentorial recurrences of gliomas: Morphological studies in relation to time intervals with astrocytomas (1977) Acta Neurochir (Wien), 37, pp. 75-91; Afra, D., Muller, W., Benoist, G., Schröder, R., Supratentorial recurrences of gliomas: Results of reoperations on astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas (1978) Acta Neurochir (Wien), 43, pp. 217-227; Laws, E.R., Taylor, W.F., Clifton, M.B., Okazaki, H., Neurosurgical management of low-grade astrocytoma of the cerebral hemispheres (1984) J Neurosurg, 61, pp. 665-673; Vertosick, F.T., Selker, R.G., Arena, V.C., Survival of patients with well-differentiated astrocytomas diagnosed in the era of computed tomography (1991) Neurosurgery, 28, pp. 496-501; Scherer, H.J., Cerebral astrocytomas and their derivatives (1940) Am J Cancer, 40, pp. 159-198; Burger, P.C., Kleihues, P., Cytologie composition of the untreated glioblastoma with implications for evaluation of needle biopsies (1989) Cancer, 63, pp. 2014-2023; Winger, M.J., Macdonald, D.R., Cairncross, J.G., Supratentorial anaplastic gliomas: The prognostic importance of extent of resection and prior low-grade glioma (1989) J Neurosurg, 71, pp. 487-493; Kleihues, P., Burger, P.C., Scheithauer, B.W., The new WHO classification of brain tumors (1993) Brain Pathol, 3, pp. 255-268; Kaplan, E.L., Meier, P., Nonparametric estimation from incomplete observations (1958) J Am Stat Assoc, 53, pp. 457-481; Mantel, N., Evaluation of survival data and two new rank order statistics arising from its consideration (1966) Cancer Chemother Rep, 50, pp. 163-170; Shaw, E.G., Scheithauer, B.W., Gilbertson, D.T., Postoperative radiotherapy of supratentorial low-grade gliomas (1989) Int J Radiât Oncol Biol Phys, 16, pp. 663-668; Shaw, E.G., Scheithauer, B., O'Fallon, J., Astrocytomas, oligoastrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas: A comparative study (1992) Neurology, 42 (3 SUPPL.), p. 342; Whitton, A.C., Bloom, H.J., Low grade glioma of the cerebral hemispheres in adults: A retrospective analysis of 88 cases (1990) Int J Radiât Oncol Biol Phys, 18, pp. 783-786; Byar, D.P., Green, S.B., Strike, T.A., Prognostic factors for malignant gliomas (1983) Oncology of the Nervous System, pp. 379-395. , Walker MD, ed.

Two patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis manifested predominantly as subacute sensory neuronopathy did not improve after prednisone treatment and chemotherapy. The third patient had severe axial and limb rigidity and myoclonus, which partially improved after chemotherapy and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and prednisone. Serum from each patient immunocytochemically stained the neuropil and to a lesser degree the neuronal cytoplasm in human cerebral and cerebellar cortex. On immunoblots of human neuronal extracts, each patient's serum contained high-titer IgG antibodies reacting with a protein band of apparent molecular mass 125 kd. This autoantibody pattern is indistinguishable from antibodies recently identified in several women with breast carcinoma and stiff-man syndrome. Screening of a human brain complementary DNA expression library with patient serum yielded clones whose sequence is identical to that of the synaptic vesicle-related protein amphiphysin. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated expression of amphiphysin in 8 of 10 small-cell lung carcinomas and in 5 of 14 breast carcinomas.

Utca, Budapest, Hungary; Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University, School of Medicine, 702 Barnhill Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5200, United States","The activity of PIP kinase (1-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase; EC 2.7.1.68), the second ATP-utilizing enzyme of 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol biosynthesis, was determined in the rat in a spectrum of transplantable solid hepatomas of different growth rates and in normal tissues of high and low cell renewal rates. In a standard isotopic method developed for the assay, the enzyme activity was linear with time for 4 min and proportional with protein concentration over a range of 0.05 to 1 mg per 0.135-ml reaction mixture. The apparent K(m) for the substrate PIP (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate) and for ATP and Mg2+ in normal liver were 0.06, 0.5, and 4.2 mM, respectively, and in rapidly growing hepatoma 3924A, 0.08, 0.7, and 7.1 mM. The kinase activity in adult Wistar rat liver was 0.046 ± 0.003 nmol/h/mg protein. In hepatomas of slow and intermediate growth rates, PIP kinase activity increased 3.3-9.7-fold, and in hepatoma 3924A, it was elevated 45-fold over that of normal liver. When hepatoma 3924A cells were plated and expressed their proliferative program, enzyme activity increased 4.3-fold in mid-log phase. To further clarify the linkage between PIP kinase activity and proliferation, enzyme activity was determined in rat organs of high and low cell renewal capacity. The PIP kinase activity in rat thymus, bone marrow, spleen, and testes was 5.4-, 6.3-, 4.8- and 4.3-fold higher, respectively, than in normal rat liver; in lung, brain, skeletal muscle, renal cortex, and heart, the activities were low. In all tissues examined, the activity of PIP kinase was 4.6 to 18% of that of phosphatidylinositol kinase. Since enzymes of crucial significance frequently have short half-lives, the decay rates of PIP kinase were examined in liver, bone marrow, and hepatoma 3924A in rats injected with cycloheximide, which inhibits protein biosynthesis. In cycloheximide-treated animals, PIP kinase had the shortest decay rate (t( 1/2 ) = 0.12 h) in comparison with eight enzymes of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis of rat bone marrow (t( 1/2 ) = 0.6 to 4.3 h). In liver and solid hepatoma 3924A, the activity of PIP kinase was degraded less rapidly (t( 1/2 ) = 5 h). The relationship of PIP kinase activity with proliferation and transformation is apparent in the high activity in thymus, bone marrow, spleen, and testes and in the increased activities in the rat hepatomas of different growth rates. The coordinate increases in phosphatidylinositol and PIP kinase activities suggest that the capacity for signal transduction is heightened in cancer cells. The elevated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentrations observed in the hepatomas support this conclusion. Since both kinase activities are linked with malignancy, these may well be sensitive targets for designing new chemotherapeutic agents.",,"adenosine triphosphate; cycloheximide; inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate; magnesium; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate; phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate kinase; phosphatidylinositol kinase; animal cell; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme analysis; enzyme assay; enzyme localization; enzyme synthesis; liver cell carcinoma; male; malignant transformation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; Animal; Bone Marrow; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Diglycerides; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Rats; Rats, Inbred ACI; Rats, Inbred BUF; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tumor Cells, Cultured",,"1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, EC 2.7.1.68; Diglycerides; Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate, 85166-31-0; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor), EC 2.7.1",,"sigma, United States",,"Weber, G.; Laboratory for Experimental Oncology; Indiana Univ.

We report that CdR kinase activity in the 100,000 x g cytosolic fraction of normal adult rat brain cortex was 0.89 ± 0.04 nmol/hr/mg protein which is twice that of the liver enzyme. For brain CdR kinase the apparent K(m) for CdR, ATP and Mg++ were 0.22, 1.1 and 0.63 mM, respectively. When the cytosolic preparation was incubated at 37°C, CdR kinase activity rapidly decreased (t( 1/2 ) = 15 min); CdR (400 μM) protected the enzyme. Addition of DFDC (0 to 100 μM) competitively inhibited brain CdR kinase activity with K(i) = 17 μM. DFDC elevated the apparent K(m) for CdR of brain CdR kinase 3.5-fold, from 0.22 to 0.8 mM. DFDC did not inhibit brain TdR kinase. AZT, which competitively inhibited TdR kinase (K(i) = 0.6 μM), did not affect brain CdR kinase activity.

The paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, and oral cavity were the most frequent sites of involvement, making up 39% of the cases - with the orbit, central nervous system, nasopharynx, salivary glands, thyroid, skin, and larynx following in that order of frequency. All patients received a definitive course of radiotherapy, except patients with CNS involvement. In no case was chemotherapy given concomitantly with the radiation therapy. One-third of the patients did require chemotherapy at a later time for progression of disease. No patients were lost to follow-up. Seven patients with primaries of the brain were inevaluable for response; however, all patients having visible or palpable tumors achieved a complete response (100%), and there was no recurrence or persistent disease in the field of therapy.

A retrospective analysis of the treatment records of all patients with brain metastases from NSGCTs treated at the Indiana University Radiation Oncology Department from 1975 through 1982 was undertaken. These 22 patients were divided into four groups. Group 1 (n = 5) consisted of those patients who presented initially with brain metastases and had no prior systemic treatment. Group 2 (n = 4) were referred to Indiana University after failing systemic therapy other than PVB chemotherapy. Group 3 (n = 5) consisted of those patients who after achieving a complete response with PVB developed a relapse confined to the brain. Group 4 (n = 8) consisted of those patients who were initially treated with PVB and eventually developed progressive disease and brain metastases. The survival by group is 80%, 0%, 60%, and 0%, respectively, with the overall survival for the entire group being 31.8%. All patients currently alive have a range of follow-up of 22 to 96 months from diagnosis and 12 to 83 months from whole brain irradiation (WBRT). Group 1 was treated with PVB+/- doxorubicin plus WBRT. Group 3 was treated with surgical excision, when feasible, followed by WBRT and platinum-containing chemotherapy. Group 2 and 4 were usually treated with palliative intent WBRT. The CNS is a site of sanctuary from PVB. Patients with brain metastases who may achieve a complete response should be treated with curative intent and receive aggressive WBRT (5,000 rad/25 fractions) with concomitant chemotherapy.",,"bleomycin; chlorambucil; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; dactinomycin; doxorubicin; melphalan; methotrexate; mithramycin; vinblastine; vincristine; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; central nervous system; central nervous system metastasis; clinical article; diagnosis; germ cell tumor; human; male genital system; priority journal; testis cancer; therapy; Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bleomycin; Brain Neoplasms; Choriocarcinoma; Cisplatin; Human; Male; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Teratoma; Testicular Neoplasms; Vinblastine",,"bleomycin, 11056-06-7; chlorambucil, 305-03-3; cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; dactinomycin, 1402-38-6, 1402-58-0, 50-76-0; doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; melphalan, 148-82-3; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; mithramycin, 18378-89-7; vinblastine, 865-21-4; vincristine, 57-22-7; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bleomycin, 11056-06-7; Cisplatin, 15663-27-1; PVB protocol; Vinblastine, 865-21-4","cytoxan; leukeran","burroughs wellcome, United States",,,,,,,,,,0732183X,,JCOND,,"English","Journal of Clinical Oncology",Article,Scopus

Of these, 115 were treated with preplanned combined modality therapy using irradiation and polychemotherapy (Adriamycin, Cytoxan and Oncovin). All patients received whole brain prophylactic irradiation and were followed a minimum of 2 years. Sixty-six patients were given chest irradiation with all but two receiving 3500-4000 rad while 49 did not receive this treatment. Sixty-five percent of those patients receiving chest irradiation had a complete response to therapy, as opposed to 33% who did not (p < 0.02). The median and overall survivals were significantly different between the 2 groups (423 days vs. 307 days). The overall and long-term survivals were higher in those receiving chest irradiation or resective surgery. Serial chest X rays (and port films, where applicable) were reviewed on all patients to determine sites of failure. Of relapsing patients who did not receive chest irradiation, failure always included the primary site. Of those who had chest irradiation, only 15% of evaluable patients did not relapse in the chest prior to death. This study demonstrates an increased response rate, median survival, and overall survival in patients receiving chest irradiation. The high rate of relapse in the chest suggests the need for more effective control of the primary.

The activities of the key de novo and salvage enzymes were also determined in mouse lung and Lewis lung carcinoma, in human kidney and liver, and in renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinomas. A precise and reproducible assay was worked out for measuring the activities of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT; EC 2.4.2.8) in crude liver and hepatoma systems. Kinetic studies on the salvage enzymes were carried out in the crude 100,000 x g supernatant fluid from normal liver and rapidly growing hepatoma 3924A. In both tissue extracts, Michaelis-Menten kinetics was observed for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and HGPRT. The reciprocal plots for 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) of liver and hepatoma enzymes gave apparent K(m)s of 2 μM for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and 4 μM for HGPRT, showing two orders of magnitude higher affinities for PRPP than that of the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo purine synthesis, amidophosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.14) (K(m) = 400 to 900 μM). The apparent K(m) values for adenine of liver and hepatoma adenine phosphoribosyltransferase were 0.6 to 0.9 μM, respectively. For both liver and hepatoma HGPRT, the reciprocal plots for hypoxanthine and guanine yielded the same K(m) of 3 μM. The specific activities of purine phosphoribosyltransferases were markedly higher than that of amidophosphoribosyltransferase in rat thymus, spleen, testis, bone marrow, colon, liver, kidney cortex, lung, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, but were lower in the small intestine. In hepatomas and regenerating and differentiating liver, the activities of the salvage enzymes were 2.1- to 32-fold higher than that of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. The purine phosphoribosyltransferase activities were also higher than that of amidophosphoribosyltransferase in Lewis lung carcinoma (8.2- to 32-fold), human renal cell carcinoma (3.5 to 22-fold), and hepatocellular carcinoma (3.4- to 30-fold). The high activities and the high affinity to PRPP of the purine phosphoribosyltransferases might explain the lack of linkage of the behavior of these enzymic activities with proliferation in normal, regenerating, differentiating, or neoplastic tissues. In contrast, the specific activity of the amidophosphoribosyltransferase, which is lower than that of the salvage enzymes, is linked with transformation as it is increased in all examined tumors. The high activity and affinity to PRPP of the purine phosphoribosyltransferases indicate the important role which salvage enzymes might play in circumventing the action of inhibitors of de novo purine biosynthesis in cancer chemotherapy.",,"adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; nucleotide; purine; radioisotope; animal cell; animal experiment; liver; liver cancer; nonhuman; rat; Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase; Adult; Amidophosphoribosyltransferase; Animal; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Human; Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase; Infant, Newborn; Kidney Neoplasms; Kinetics; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Regeneration; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Nucleotides; Pentosyltransferases; Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tissue Distribution",,"adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, 9027-80-9; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, 9016-12-0; purine, 120-73-0; Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.7; Amidophosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.14; Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.8; Nucleotides; Pentosyltransferases, EC 2.4.2.; Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase, EC 2.4.2.1",,,,,,,,,,,,00085472,,CNREA,,"English","Cancer Research",Article,Scopus

The L-glutamine concentration in the slowly growing hepatomas was in the range of the normal liver and it decreased in relation to the increase of hepatoma growth rate, in the most rapidly growing tumors amounting to 12% of that of normal liver. In 24-hour regenerating liver, the glutamine content was slightly reduced (by 17%). In normal rat organs of high cell renewal, such as testis, intestinal mucosa, spleen, and thymus, the L-glutamine concentration was 18 to 46% of that of normal rat liver. The L-glutamine content was similar in rat brain and liver, but it was 1.6-fold higher in the heart, and low in the blood. Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.3) activity in normal adult liver of ACI/N strain rats was 1,000 nmol per hr per mg protein; the activity increased in the very slowly growing hepatoma 20, but decreased markedly in all the other hepatomas. Thus, glutamine synthetase activity was essentially transformation-linked. The negative correlation of glutamine content with growth rate in transplanted hepatomas appears to be more closely linked with the activities of enzymes that utilize glutamine. The low L-glutamine concentration in the rapidly growing hepatomas provides a potential marker for anti-glutamine chemotherapy selectively targeted against the glutamine-utilizing enzymes.",,"animal experiment; cancer growth; cell proliferation; levoglutamide; liver; liver cell carcinoma; nonhuman; rat; Animal; Cell Differentiation; Cell Division; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase; Glutamine; Hepatectomy; Liver; Liver Neoplasms, Experimental; Liver Regeneration; Male; Rats; Rats, Inbred ACI; Rats, Inbred BUF; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tissue Distribution",,"Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase, EC 6.3.1.2; Glutamine, 56-85-9",,,,,,,,,,,,00243205,,LIFSA,10.1016/0024-3205(84)90603-9,"English","Life Sciences",Article,Scopus
