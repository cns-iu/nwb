# each input file will be mapped to inFile[x] (zero based) 
# This used to be just: file:text/graphml+xml
# GUESS can't handle the case when the input GraphML file has both "id" attributes and child
# elements on the nodes (and probably edges too, but that hasn't been checked).
# So, in efforts to solve http://cns-jira.slis.indiana.edu/browse/SCISQUARED-205, we implemented
# a custom converter from standard GraphML to this magical "GraphML For GUESS" and changed the
# accepted MIME type here.
in_data=file:text/graphml_for_guess+xml
# for all input files, 'null' if no input data needed
out_data=null
# for all output files
# each output file will correspond to outFile[x] (zero based)
