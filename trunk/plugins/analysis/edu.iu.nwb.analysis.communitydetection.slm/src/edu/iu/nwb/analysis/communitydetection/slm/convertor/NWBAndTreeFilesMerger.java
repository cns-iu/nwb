// This is the third stage of the Blondel Community Detection algorithm.
// The input to this stage is the output of the second stage, which is a tree
// file.
// The input tree file consists of pairs of integer, where each first
// integer is a node index and each second integer is the index of the
// community that it belongs to.  Each node index of 0 indicates a new
// community level.
// For a given community level, each node is actually a community of the
// previous level.  The exception to this rule is the first level, for which
// each node is an actual node on the original network.
// The input tree file is parsed and mapped to the nodes on the original input
// network.  The result of this mapping is a new network with nodes that are
// annotated to have attributes that specify which communities they belong to
// at various community levels.  This new network is output as a new NWB
// file.
