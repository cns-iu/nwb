db4o - Native object database engine
------------------------------------

"db4o is the open source object database that enables Java and .NET developers 
to slash development time and costs and achieve unprecedented levels of 
performance. The unique design of db4o's native object database engine makes 
it the ideal choice to be embedded in equipment and devices, in packaged 
software running on mobile or desktop platforms, or in real-time control 
systems - in short: in all Java and .NET environments, where no database 
administrator (DBA) is present."
