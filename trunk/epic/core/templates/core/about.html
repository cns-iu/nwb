  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <h2>EpiC: A Computational Infrastructure for Epidemics Research</h2>

  <p>
    Epidemic and diffusion processes are of great importance in the
    modeling, forecast, and analysis of a wide range of problems relevant to
    public health. The spread of infectious diseases remains a serious
    medical burden around the world and causes an estimated 15 million
    deaths each year. The epidemic paradigm can also be fruitfully applied
    to a wide range of "social contagion processes" where the acquisition or
    increase of a behavior or cultural habit is related to social contacts
    between the "uninfected population" and the "infected population". The
    epidemic approach has already proven useful in understanding social
    behaviors such as tobacco, alcohol, and heroin use. The study of
    epidemic processes is a particularly challenging undertaking, because it
    requires a truly interdisciplinary effort that combines and integrates
    knowledge, datasets, and techniques developed in epidemiology, medicine,
    physics, computer science, and social and behavioral sciences, among
    others.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project will the design, implementation, deployment, and
    maintenance of a computational infrastructure for epidemics research,
    called the Epidemics Cyberinfrastructure (EpiC). EpiC will support the
    integration of large numbers of complex datasets at a variety of
    levels, e.g., population density, patient records, and social behavior,
    as well as state of the art analysis, modeling, and visualization tools
    capable of dealing with non-linear and complex phenomena emerging in
    large populations. Unlike other cyberinfrastructure (CI) efforts, EpiC
    proposes the design, implementation, validation, and community support
    of a "bazaar" - like infrastructure that will be a marketplace for
    epidemics resources. EpiC will provide members of the scientific
    research community at large with the means to carry out data analysis,
    modeling, and visualization at multiple levels of analysis of social
    contagion and epidemic processes.
  </p>

  <ol>
    Specifically, this project will
    <li>
      Develop a novel type of cyberinfrastructure, called EpiC
      CIShell, resembling an "empty shell" that can be filled with
      epidemics-related resources such as datasets, algorithms, and
      visualization components. This novel type of CI supports the easy
      assembly of EpiC Tools aimed at specific research projects for a few
      weeks, months, or years.
    </li>

    <li>
      Setup and maintain an EpiC Marketplace that serves as an
      index to EpiC resources. The marketplace will draw on the successful
      interaction designs that drive popular file and content sharing
      community sites like <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>,
      <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, or
      <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. However,
      instead of sharing images, movies, or encyclopedia entries, scholars
      will use EpiC to share datasets, algorithms, visualizations, and other
      items relevant to the study of epidemics.
    </li>

    <li>
      Apply EpiC prototypically to tackle research questions about
      computational approaches to epidemic modeling. This will lead to the
      development of EpiC tools that are specifically tailored to the forecast
      of emerging disease spreading on the global scale and social contagion
      processes in the area of smoking habits.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The overarching goals of EpiC are the improvement and
    facilitation of multi-scale analysis of social data integrated into
    dynamic systems modeling, agent-based modeling, and other simulation
    techniques for epidemic processes; the direct transfer of knowledge and
    results from fields of specialist research (computational modeling,
    mathematical epidemiology, large scale visualization etc.) to the wider
    scientific community; the development of a cyberinfrastructure
    technology that is open, usable, extensible, and sustainable.
