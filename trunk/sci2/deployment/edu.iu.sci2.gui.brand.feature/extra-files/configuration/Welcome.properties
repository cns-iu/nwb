greeting = Welcome to the Science of Science Tool (Sci2).\n\
\n\
The development of this tool is supported in part by the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science center and the \
Department of Information and Library Science in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, \
the National Science Foundation under Grant No. SBE-0738111 and IIS-0715303, and the James S. McDonnell Foundation. \
See the Science of Science Cyberinfrastructure portal (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) for documentation, screenshots, and \
to ask an expert. \n\
\n\
The primary investigators are Katy Börner, Indiana University and Kevin W. Boyack, SciTech Strategies Inc. The Sci2 \
tool was developed by Chin Hua Kong, Adam Simpson, Steven Corenflos, Joseph Biberstine, Thomas G. Smith, David M. Coe, \
Micah W. Linnemeier, Patrick A. Phillips, Chintan Tank, and Russell J. Duhon. It uses the Cyberinfrastructure Shell \
(http://cishell.org) developed at the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (http://cns.iu.edu) at \
Indiana University. Many algorithm plugins were derived from the Network Workbench Tool (http://nwb.cns.iu.edu).\n\
