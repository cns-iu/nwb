More than 150,000 titles have been published including thousands distributed by the United States and other governments. Yet no viable strategy has been developed to ensure that these materials will be accessible to future generations of scholars. In the short term, these materials are subject to physical degradation which will make them ultimately unreadable and, in the long-term, technological obsolescence will make their contents unusable. This project will develop practical techniques using off-the-shelf emulators with virtualization software to ensure long-term viability of CD-ROM materials. Although emulation has been widely discussed as a preservation strategy, it suffers from a fundamental flaw, since future users are unlikely to be familiar with legacy software environments and will find such software increasingly difficult to use. Furthermore the user communities of many such materials are sparse and distributed, thus any necessary technical knowledge is unlikely to be available to library patrons. The key objective of this project is to develop the technology and processes necessary to mitigate these flaws and to enable large-scale deployment of emulation by libraries and archives.<br/><br/>This project will develop automation technologies to capture the technical knowledge necessary to install and perform common actions with legacy CD-ROM materials in the form of scripts for performing on-the-fly customization of \generic"" emulation environments. The long-term vision is to support a distributed CD-ROM collection, developed by a community of libraries, which enables client workstations to access preserved CD-ROM images through customized emulation environments. The project will explore the costs of developing the scripts necessary to automate the use of specific CD-ROMs and the technologies necessary to enable libraries to pool their resources to create a distributed network preserved CD-ROM materials.<br/><br/>The project is structured as a two-year pilot study that will develop automation tools, apply these tools to a large (several thousand representative set of CD-ROM materials, evaluate the performance of this approach in a distributed environment, disseminate the tools and scripts as software artifacts, and provide statistics for planning the large-scale preservation of CD-ROM materials. The research performed in this proposal will enable libraries and archives to solve a growing problem while reducing the resources required to maintain their collections of removable media. This project provides a foundation for libraries and archives to pool their intellectual resources by providing access to virtual media collections accessed through shared emulators using community generated scripts. The materials whose preservation will be enabled by this project include key scientific and societal data published by United States and other governments as well as cultural and educational materials from many sources. This project will have a significant impact on undergraduate science education by direct mentoring of undergraduate research assistants and providing the opportunity for their involvement in writing and presenting scholarly works."

SEAD will enable new modalities of sustainability science - the study of dynamic interactions between nature and society. Advancing the science of sustainability requires integration of social science, natural science, and environmental data at multiple spatial and temporal scales that is rich in local and location-specific observations; referenced for regional, national, and global comparability and scale; and integrated to enable end users to detect interactions among multiple phenomena. SEAD will respond to the expressed needs of sustainability science researchers for long-term management of heterogeneous data by developing new capabilities for data integration, dissemination, and long-term preservation. SEAD will provide researchers with tools for active curation and use social networking to engage data producers and users in community curation, gradually shifting curatorial and collection development responsibilities from professional curators to the producer and user communities. Our focus is on the ""long tail"" of social and environmental data: derived data products, data collections from individual PI's and small group investigations, and data sets of local, regional or topical significance that are critical to sustainability science but are of limited value until they can be referenced geo-spatially and temporally, combined with related data and observations, and modeled consistently. SEAD will make data accessible to diverse users, including domain scientists, local, national and international policy makers, manufacturers of sustainable technologies, citizen scientists, and informed consumers. SEAD will take advantage of existing robust digital library and institutional repository (IR) infrastructures at the three universities for access, storage, and preservation to ensure wide accessibility of data, linkages between data and scientific publications, and persistence.<br/><br/>SEAD will serve researchers efficiently and in a financially sustainable way via active curation, make innovative use of social networking, integrate data with existing digital library infrastructures, and provide synthesis services that significantly increase the research and societal value of data. Our work will establish a new active curation paradigm that can be readily integrated into the scientific workflow and that leverages social networking technologies to engage the science community in data curation. Our research program will produce novel solutions to the synthesis of heterogeneous data across different levels of spatio-temporal granularity and scope; management of logical contexts and data models; appropriate sharing of data with privacy and proprietary restrictions; and preservation through emulation and migration-based-technologies and policies for distributed stewardship. Our cyberinfrastructure development work will support a network of repositories that functions on several levels: locally through integration of SEAD data into campus digital library/repository infrastructures, inter-institutionally through a model for distributed data curation and storage, and nationally and internationally by extending our approach to other IRs, other DataNet Partners, sensor and observational networks, and topical data archives. Our financial sustainability plan will identify appropriate incentive mechanisms and business models based on a tight coupling of preservation and access services with research library managed IR infrastructure and ongoing involvement of scientists and users.<br/><br/>SEAD will build national and global capabilities for science-informed sustainability policy and planning in land use, natural resource management, agriculture, energy, economic development, ""green"" manufacturing, and related areas where critical decisions will be made in the next decade. The project will engage the community that preserves and shares scientific data, thus enhancing the public investment in scientific research and making taxpayer funded data widely available and easier to use which will provide high-value cost-effective curation and preservation capabilities through partnerships with other ""small science"" domains."

While federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation have invested very successfully in repositories, infrastructure, and tools for data-intensive science, investing in data solutions is not the same as investing in high performance computing resources because unlike general purpose compute facilities where the facility can be separated from the use, it is difficult to separate data from its semantics, so general purpose solutions only address part of the problem, and a small part at that. Recognizing the opportunities that could be realized through stronger integrated efforts, NSF is encouraging a path towards coordinated efforts that result in satisfying the needs of a broader constituency that strives for interoperability, harmonization of concepts, protocols, and standards nationally and internationally. This proposal is a small but fundamental next step towards building an organization with lasting and significant impact on the broader community engaged in 4th paradigm research and education."

Data infrastructure includes cyber-infrastructure tools for data discovery and analysis (and their underlying technical structures and components -- persistent digital identifiers, shared metadata frameworks, etc.), and social infrastructure in the form of community policy and organizational practice (harmonization of standards, approaches for data access and preservation, etc.). To address the growing global need for data infrastructure, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) was planned and launched in FY13 as an international community-driven organization. RDA's mission is to build the social, organizational, and technical infrastructure needed to reduce barriers to data sharing and exchange, and to accelerate data-driven innovation world-wide. In the wake of precipitous growth, RDA is now working to develop a stable support model for at least a five-year period. The RDA 2 project provides support for U.S. participation and leadership within the RDA, as well as strategic expansion of the U.S. community within RDA (RDA/U.S.). RDA 2 integrates a) strategic efforts and pilots to expand, diversify, and strengthen the RDA/U.S. community, and b) support for U.S. contributions to RDA operations and leadership, including U.S. participation in, and hosting of, RDA Plenaries. RDA/U.S. will be led by a Steering Committee consisting of Fran Berman, RPI (Chair), Beth Plale, IU, (Vice Chair, Technical Programs), Larry Lannom, CNRI, (Vice Chair, Outreach and Development) and Mark Parsons, RPI (Managing Director).<br/><br/>The RDA 2 project builds RDA through increasing U.S. engagement and leadership. RDA 2 builds RDA/U.S. through pilots in three strategic areas: Community Engagement and Outreach, Student and Early Career Engagement, and Adoption and Impact Amplification. The pilots are designed to expand and diversify RDA/U.S. data community, increase the impact of RDA deliverables in the U.S., and enhance the benefit of RDA for U.S. institutions, communities, businesses, and individuals. A strong RDA/U.S. can be a vehicle for accelerating U.S. innovation, and positioning the U.S. community for greater competitiveness and leadership. RDA/U.S. can contribute to the data infrastructure needed to make new U.S. policy approaches and initiatives work, and serve as a means of capitalizing"

This is particularly the case with the science of climate and global environmental change. With this evolution has come the fundamental importance of data storage and archiving. There is an open problem in archiving digital science data that affects many fundamental science initiatives. <br/><br/>We propose an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) (2009) compliant data archival repository that lives early in the scientific research pipeline, supporting the ingest and access mechanisms that users have become accustomed to and have staff to support, while simultaneously providing support for curation and preservation of data, and making relational database, and eventually other databases, more usable in real time by researchers and policy makers. The testbed for this approach is the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) database, the most complete data archive of how communities develop strategies for sustainable forest management. The IFRI scientific user community consists of field visits every five years to over 250 diverse sites in 11 countries.<br/><br/>The proposed repository conceptually wraps the original database into a unit that also contains a metadata catalog and provenance collection tool with interaction and replication guided by the OAIS standard. A fundamental research question in this effort is the data model that maps a database schema to an object model which abstracts scientific intent. The abstraction of scientific intent is grounded in a general conceptual model for reasoning about the life cycle of social-ecological systems and their interactions and outcomes. We thus expect to generalize the tools and data model that provide the map from a database to the science-oriented conceptual model expressed as an ontology.<br/><br/>The International Forestry Resources and Institutions network includes twelve Collaborating Research Centers in ten countries on four continents. The early research conducted in this project will form a foundation for outreach through IFRI that could have broad potential for science and policy impacts worldwide. The proposal funds a computer science graduate student and postdoctoral fellow who will be engaged in interdisciplinary research in an area of emerging importance in the next many generations.<br/><br/>A critical component of the long term success of the ideas of this proposal will be by getting word out. Therefore we will seek to present talks about these tools and approach long-term digital data collection projects, particularly ones focused on environmental monitoring such as LTER and OOI."

Research and development efforts at IU will create the tools required for the Data Capacitor to be used to its fullest. Progress and research possibilities in many disciplines have been fundamentally changed by the abundance of data now so rapidly produced by advanced digital instruments. Scientists face the present challenge of drawing out from these data the information and meaning contained within. IU has established a significant cyberinfrastructure composed of high performance computing systems, archival storage systems, and advanced visualization systems spanning two main campuses in Indianapolis and Bloomington, and connected to national and international networks. This institution enhances its infrastructure in ways that will result in qualitative changes in the research capabilities and discovery opportunities of a broad array of scientist that work with large data sets. The Data Capacitor is expected to become a development platform and testbed for new cyberinfrastructure, as well as a proof of concept for large capacity, short-term storage devices. On the other hand, the Metadata/Web Services server enables the institution to establish a leadership position in standards-based data dissemination in many fields.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The Data Capacitor enhances current practice in relevant scientific communities, enables technology transfer and commercialization, develops a 21st century workforce, and ensures public understanding of the value of science. Deliberate use of objective metrics in all areas of broader impact ensures that new discoveries, technology development, educational activities, and public information efforts translate into benefit for the scientific community and society as a whole.

The first outcome of this work is a provenance collection and experience reuse tool that makes minimal assumptions about the software environment and imposes minimal burden on the application writer. It stores and produces results in a form suitable for publication to a digital library. The provenance collection system is a standalone system that imposes a minimal burden on users to integrate it into their application framework and it exhibits good performance. <br/><br/>A second outcome of the work is a recommender system for workflow completion that employs case-based reasoning to provenance collections in order to make suggestions to users about future workflow-driven investigations. The workflow completion tool builds on computer models of case-based reasoning to develop a support system that leverages the collective experience of the users of the provenance system to provide suggestions. As a key part of effectively evaluating aspects of the tool, this work builds a gigabyte benchmark database of real and synthetic provenance information. Real workflows are sought from the community, with synthetic extensions to the data set for completeness for purposes of testing. The software and database are available to the research community."

It is difficult to use cloud computing resources for large-scale, high throughput ensemble jobs however. Additionally, the computationally oriented researcher is increasingly encouraged to make data sets available to the broader community. For the latter to be achieved, using capture tools during experimentation to harvest metadata and provenance reduces the manual burden of marking up results. Better automatic capture of metadata and provenance is the only means by which sharing of scientific data can scale to meet the burgeoning explosion of data.<br/><br/>This project develops a pipeline framework for running ensemble simulations on the cloud; the framework has two key components: ensemble deployment and metadata harvest. Regarding the former, on commercial cloud platforms typically a much smaller number of jobs than desired can be started at any one time. An ensemble run will need to be pipelined to a cloud resource, that is, executed in well-controlled batches over a period of time. We will use platform features of Azure, and employ machine learning techniques to continuously refine the pipeline submission strategy and workflow strategies for ensemble parameter specification, pipelined deployment, and metadata capture. Regarding the latter key component, we expect to reduce the burden of sharing scientific datasets resulting from the use of cloud resources through automatic metadata and provenance capture and representation that aligns the metadata with emerging best practices in data sharing and discovery. Ensemble simulations result in complex data sets, whose reuse could be increased by expressive, granule and collection level metadata, including the lineage of the resulting products, to contribute towards trust.<br/><br/>In this project we focus on a compelling and timely application from climate research: One of the more immediate and dangerous impacts of climate change could be a change in the strength of storms that form over the oceans. In addition, as sea level rises due to global warming and melting of the polar ice caps, coastal communities will become increasingly vulnerable to storm surge. There have already been indications that even modest changes in ocean surface temperature can have a disproportionate effect on hurricane strength and the damage inflicted by these storms. In an effort to understand these impacts, modelers turn to predictions generated by hydrodynamic coastal ocean models such as the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The proposed research advances the knowledge and understanding of probabilistic storm surge products by enhancements to the SLOSH model itself and through mechanisms that take advantage of commercial cloud resources. This knowledge is expected to have application in research, the classroom, and in operational settings.<br/><br/>The broader significance of the project is several-fold. Cloud computing is an important economic driver but it remains difficult for use in computationally driven scientific research. This project lowers the barriers to conducting e-Science research that utilizes cloud resources, specifically Azure. It will contribute tools to help researchers share, preserve, and publicize the scientific data sets that result from their research. Because we focus on and improve an application that predicts storm surge in response to sea level changes and severe storms, our work contributes to societal responses and adaptations to climate change, including planning and building the sustainable, hazard-resilient coastal communities of the future."

This approach separates portal control and basic services from content. A central control server provides basic portal services such as authentication, access control, and user customizability. Into this framework, portal content and custom services are plugged in using software components called portlets. The container manages the organization and interaction of the portlets, and the portlets deliver specific web content (either local or remote), including Grid service interfaces.<br/><br/>The portlet-based design concept supports distributed, loosely coupled development and deployment: user interfaces and science interface components can be developed independently, using the standard portlet API, and then reused between portals. Services and interfaces may be installed and added to various portals in a well-defined way. The portlet model is also an ideal fit to the emerging Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) and its implementation specification, the Open Grid Service Infrastructure (OGSI). Because OGSI is based on the new web-service standards, each Grid service can be directly accessed by a custom portlet. <br/><br/>The impact of making the Grid readily approachable by the international community of researchers is potentially extremely large, as the immense resources that have been collected and organized in recent years by the underlying Grid technologies become visible as usable components of the global research community's desktop. This project will greatly simplify the use of Grid technologies and allow new services to be made readily available to individual researchers and groups by enabling the proliferation of Grid portal technology through reusability and simplification of installation. Scientists will be able to easily form flexible groups with collaborators across the world and use the Grid to share data and resources. This project provides tools for collaboration between established and ad hoc groups of users, enabling those scientists to communicate effectively with each other about the science they are doing, and providing customized views of the Grid that are tailored to meet the needs of collaborating groups."

This requires information about the properties of Grid resources such as hosts, network switches, links and paths, software libraries and systems, user and organization rights, software services, event channels and dictionaries, and more. The information needed for an application to run, the values of the information (how fast the information changes) and the freshness of the information (how fast updates must be pushed to the application) can vary dramatically. These attributes place significant demands on the resource information service, demands that are arising with increasing prevalence in the general area of directory services as well. The Grid Forum, an international standards body for world-wide Grid computing, is developing standards for representing and querying this information. There is much that is excellent about these evolving standards, but there are many forms of highly desirable queries that will be difficult or expensive to perform in these systems. In particular, dynamic information will require very high update rates not supported by LDAP-based implementations.<br/><br/>This project will address these concerns through a proposed (and tentatively named) Grid Resource Information Service (GRIS), a unified relational approach to grid information services. The research will start with the full ACID (Atomicity/Consistency/Isolation/Durability) functionality of a relational database system and ""build down"" to a practical resource information system that still provides most of the benefits of the RDBMS. Such a system will provide a single highly flexible query model and language for all types of Grid resource information, no matter how dynamic. The research will culminate in an extensible implementation based on commodity database systems and the SQL language, including ""canned queries"" for non-SQL users. The project will evaluate the new system and techniques using logged updates and queries from an existing Grid information service, and comparing results with a hierarchical system such as Globus MDS2. To facilitate comparisons, the project will produce a set of benchmark queries from discussions with users, tool developers, and Grid Forum members, and will quantify the limits of these queries."

Services being explored include software development, parallel code middleware, distributed software components for scientific computing, security for parallel remote method invocation, <br/>managing large-scale data streams, and collaboration methodologies. The research builds on and extends the institutions collaborations with several national Grid research teams. In contrast to existing national and university infrastructure available through production machines, this research requires an environment tolerant of experimental network protocols, temporary middleware, and other system-level changes. The infrastructure will contribute to the following research projects:<br/>a. Opie: basic work on parallel matrix algorithms that achieve high efficiency across many architectural platforms<br/>b. LAM: middleware MPI implementations supporting hierarchical and fault-tolerant parallel computing<br/>c. dQUOB: application of SQL queries to live data streams<br/>d. RMI Security: basic research into security mechanisms for remote method invocation, allowing security to be traded off with efficiency<br/>e. HPJ: High Performance Java creating a language platform for portable high performance coding<br/>f. Grid Broker: reliable, robust publish/subscribe service for introducing fault tolerance into the distributed Grid environment<br/>g. Community Grids Collaboratory: advanced collaboration capabilities with applications to both distance education and distributed communities<br/>h. Xports: design of methodologies for remote instrument access and data management of the resulting extremely large data sets<br/>i. Software Components: distributed software component model designed for applications that use parallel computing ""nodes"" in wide-area Grid environments<br/>j. Science Portals: set of tools that allow programmers to build Grid distributed applications accessed and controlled from desktop environments and web browsers<br/>Major improvements to infrastructure supporting all these projects include a 16-node cycle server and a large-scale file server as well as network upgrades to and within the building."

These computations can often be viewed as complex data flow graphs having components that are both data- and computationally- intensive, and requiring access to live data feeds and access to large-scale computational resources. A user may cycle through multiple graphs accessing data from sensors, instruments, databases, and large collections of files in the process of discovering new knowledge. This research investigates a programming model and framework for knowledge discovery in data-driven applications. Users program the system by declarative specification of detect-analyze-response behavior. Underlying the programming model is a continuous rule-based events processor and workflow orchestration engine organized as Web services. The research formalizes an abstract model of interaction and will map the higher-level conceptualization to the events processing and workflow runtime components. It demonstrates that the model supports a unique adaptive framework where knowledge gained from the computational and data analysis can be fed back to the data event streams. The approach is validated experimentally through quantifiable metrics and by its application to two model problems: severe storm prediction where a weather forecast is triggered based on data mining results from mining radar or model data, and adaptive resource management where hardware and software resources and environment data streams are monitored for on-the-fly resource requirements<br/>prediction."

To address the problem of large data flows and incompatibility between components, the PI is proposing a general middleware scheme called active streams: an approach for controlling data flow by injecting computational components directly into a data flow. A computational component implements one or more event-action rules, in the style of active databases, where a set of events triggers a rule action. To summarize the goal of the project is an architecture , abstractions, and algorithms for middleware components that are efficient in the internal query evaluation, and responsive to changes in the environment."
