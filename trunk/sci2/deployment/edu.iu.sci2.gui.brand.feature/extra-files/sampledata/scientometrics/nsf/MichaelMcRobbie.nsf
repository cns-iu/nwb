On October 1, 2004, the ETF will conclude a three-year construction effort to create this distributed environment and will transition into an operational state. This proposal outlines a set of services to be provided at Indiana University (IU) as part of the TeraGrid system. <br/><br/>IU was funded, along with Purdue University, in September 2003 by the NSF to be part of the TeraGrid via the Terascale Extensions Program (TEP). As part of the ongoing maintenance and operations (M&O) phase, IU requests funding via this proposal for early operations of its ETF facilities and for TG services for the period from October 1, 2004 through March 30, 2005. Resources and services described herein will be provided to the scientific and engineering community by IU as one of the nine TG RPs. This proposal describes both IU-specific functions as well as IU.s participation in TG-wide activities."

The proposed distributed facility for managing, analyzing, and visualizing instrument-driven data would address the data life cycle consisting of data capture and remote data reduction; high speed data transfer; real time data analysis and processing; data storage; data retreival; data analysis and postprocessing; data visualization; and the use of remote data stores. Among the research projects enhanced and enabled by the proposed facility are both computer science and applications area projects, for example work on end-to-end real time data management for remote control and use of beam-line systems by X-ray crystallographers"

APAN presently involves advanced networks in Japan, Korea, Singapore and Australia and is expected soon to involve other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The overall consortium (APAN plus Indiana University) is called TransPAC. TransPAC proposed to provide a 35 Mbps link between the Tokyo node of APAN and the vBNS via the NSF-funded international connection point for high-performance networks, STAR TAP, in Chicago. TransPAC will initially provide a high performance connection for about 50 joint US/Asia-Pacific projects that will leverage an estimated $200 million of research over the period of the TransPAC award."

Funding is provided to establish a 20 gigabit/second connection from Indiana University and Purdue University through Indianapolis to the Chicago Hub of the ETF.<br/><br/>As a result of the funding provided through this Terascale Extension Award, Indiana University and Purdue University will be contributing a significant fraction of their resources to the ETF user community including: 1) a heterogeneous group of systems delivering 1.67 teraflops on an ongoing basis with the capability to offer up to 6.26 teraflops for very demanding well-justified applications; 2) a baseline storage capacity offered as part of ETF would include 129 terabytes with peak demand contributions exceeding 400 terabytes; 3) access to a variety of visualization resources including a CAVE, an Immersadesk, Display Walls, etc. are also offered; 4) specialized instrumentation facilities including the Purdue Terrestrial Observatory, and the Service Crystallography at Advanced Photon Sources (SCrAPS); and 5) access to a number of large scientific data sets in the life sciences, earth system simulations, vegetation and soils research, multispectral remote sensing imaging, geological GIS data, economic and social scientific data, and anthropological data. <br/><br/>Investigators at both Indiana University and Purdue University will also contribute significantly to the broader goals of the Extensible Terascale Facility. They have a significant concentration of expertise in areas of grid computing, middleware, and portal development. Both universities, through their IP-Grid participation, also have extensive outreach activities fostering the training and education of a diverse technological workforce extending from K-12 programs through undergraduate and graduate programs."

Although the <br/>project will address a wide range of multimedia digital libraries issues, it is unique in it's comprehensive approach to musical content and the internet - pressing contemporary issues capturing <br/>intense public and commercial interest. The project will involve a large team of interdisciplinary researchers at multiple sites. There is as of yet no comparable digital music library to that presented in <br/>the proposal. As a digital library system, the DML will provide integrated multimedia access to a large corpus of musical material. As a research and educational resource for a large, diverse group of <br/>communities, the project promises to draw out new uses and user needs and stimulate creative activities in many areas."
