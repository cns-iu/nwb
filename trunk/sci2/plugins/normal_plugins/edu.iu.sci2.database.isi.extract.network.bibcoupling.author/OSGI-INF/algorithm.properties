# Times coupled:
# Consider all references on all documents for both authors.
# Count the number of DISTINCT references that they share.
#
# Normalizing factors:
# For each author, count the number of distinct references among all of their documents.
#
# Note that we consider two references to be the same according to reference primary key equality.
