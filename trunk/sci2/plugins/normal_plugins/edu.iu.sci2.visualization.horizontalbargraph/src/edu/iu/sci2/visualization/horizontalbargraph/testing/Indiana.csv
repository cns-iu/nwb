LENS will use the existing linear accelerator at IUCF to produce 11 MeV protons, generating a pulsed neutron beam through (p, n) reactions on a Be target.  Not only is LENS a novel and relatively inexpensive pulsed cold neutron source, but also - when completed in 2005 - LENS will enable the design of novel neutron instrumentation for small angle scattering, a broad program of research in materials science and biology, the development of novel neutron sources and moderators, and the education and training of the next generation of neutron scientists in the United States.  LENS will also serve as a regional user facility that will be particularly well-suited for high-risk experiments and feasibility studies.      The particular aspects of LENS that are being completed through this project are (1) the construction of neutron guides and (2) the development of a novel Larmor Precession Scattering Instrument (PSI) for spin-echo small-angle neutron scattering (SESANS) experiments.  PSI will use polarized neutrons and will be sensitive to structures in the size range from 10 nm to 1000 nm.  It can be operated either as a relectometer or as a high-resolution difractometer.  In addition, use of coherent neutron waves from pinhole sources, a coded aperture mask, and newly developed phase-contrast imaging will allow imaging of structures from 1 micron to 1cm in size.  With conventional small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), the SESANS PSI, and phase-contrast imaging, LENS will enable qualitatively new types of neutron scattering measurements, leading to new science.  Among the initial experiments that will be conducted at LENS are studies of heterogeneities in glasses and ceramics, ""spintronics"" in magnetic semiconductors, hydride formation in alloys and pure metals, polymer networks and blends, nanostructured polymers, RNA helicases and protein:protein complexes, and chlorophyll aggregates.    Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), using neutrons with relatively low energies (so-called ""cold"" neutrons), allows scientists to study aspects of materials and biological substances that are not accessible using other types of radiation, such as X-rays.  In particular, neutrons are sensitive probes of the structure and dynamics of atoms and molecules.  For this reason, they have now become widely used, not only in physics, chemistry, and materials science, but also in biology, earth science, and engineering.      With the completion of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2006, neutrons promise to be used increasingly as sensitive and versatile scientific probes.  However, the relative dearth of neutron sources in the United States up to this time has contributed to the depletion of the ranks of U. S. neutron scientists.  The Low Energy Neutron Scattering (LENS) facility at Indiana University will help to correct this situation by providing in a university setting the opportunity for the education and training of the next generation of neutron scientists, including those from fields such as biology that have not traditionally employed neutron scattering techniques to the full extent of their usefulness.  In addition, LENS will serve as a regional user facility, enabling investigators from other institutions - including industry - to make use of neutron-scattering methods.  LENS will also be used for potentially high-payoff experiments that are too risky to justify time on larger pulsed-neutron sources.",Paul Sokol|David Baxter|Hermann Nann|John Cameron|William Snow

There are two major foci (i) providing comprehensive professional development for leadership cadres of teachers and principals; and (ii) insuring that all IMI districts will derive permanent benefit from a major overhaul of the preservice preparation of elementary and high school teachers by the university.  Specifically the partnership is to establish linkages between IU's preservice program and IMI districts to enhance the ability of the districts to both attract and retain qualified mathematics teachers.    One component of the project is the identification of a leadership cadre (390 elementary and 60 middle grades teachers) to effectively pilot a mathematics curriculum, selected by the partners for its alignment with state academic mathematics standards, in order to improve student achievement.  The project will use student performance data on the state ISTEP assessment examinations as a major measure of the effectiveness of the elementary pilot project.  A second component is the high school plan with the identification of a leadership cadre of 90 high school mathematics teachers and 30 eighth grade mathematics teachers.

These properties include free energy, enthalpy and entropy values, freezing points (if indeed films do freeze), and phase relationships in the formation of gas clathrate hydrates within the films.  In addition, spectroscopic studies, together with theoretical collaborations, are expected to yield structural information on molecular orientations and hydrogen bonding networks from submonolayer to multilayer adlayers of water.  The model insulator surfaces will include those associated with ionic (such as magnesium oxide), covalent (such as silica), and molecular (such as polyethylene) substrates.  Ice near its melting point will receive particularly close attention as a substrate.  Surface melting studies of ice induced by gaseous sulfur dioxide and formation of the sulfur dioxide-clathrate at the ice-vapor interface could improve understanding of the nature of anomalous sulfur dioxide uptake by snow in the Earth's polar regions.     Thin films of water coat many common substances in the natural environment, including ice near its melting point.  Like other nanostructures, thin films of water exhibit behavior that is different from that of bulk liquid water. This research will explore significant properties of these ubiquitous films. Outcomes are expected to impact fundamental issues in the properties of thin water films, and will be relevant to many problems in environmental science.  Examples of applications where thin water films play an important role are in cloud formation, soil properties, and caking problems in solids (such as salt, detergents, and fertilizer).",George Ewing|

This involves interesting and nonstandard issues in singular perturbation theory, dynamical systems and bifurcation, spectral theory of linear operators, and nonlinear partial differential equations, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. The ultimate physical goal is an understanding of stability phenomena that is both more complete and more precise than can be obtained within simplified models: on the one hand resolving philosophical puzzles at the level of mathematical foundations and on the other yielding quantitative predictions at the level of practical application. The plan of attack centers around Evans function and related spectral techniques developed recently in the study of stability of viscous shock fronts.    The stability of regular flow patterns is an old and central topic in fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics, deciding which (stable) patterns will typically be observed, and which (unstable) are only mathematical and not physically observable solutions.  The transition from stability to instability is of particular importance, since it usually signals the arising of alternative, more complicated flow patterns close to the original (now unstable) one- this is a way to understand complicated flows by the study of simpler and better-understood ones.  Despite a large and well-known body of theory on this subject, dating back to the late 1800's, there are still many aspects that are poorly understood, particularly for compressive, viscous, or reacting flows.  Here, we propose to study several of these issues arising in compressible gas and plasma dynamics, and in combustion, applications in which such usually neglected effects are of considerable practical importance.  Our goal is, by including these mathematically problematic terms, to move existing theory from the qualitative to the quantitative regime, obtaining new information of use to practitioners at the same time that we advance the mathematical theory. The planned activities have both analytic and numerical components, and involve collaboration with domestic and foreign colleagues and with current and former graduate students and post doctorates. This may be expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across field and institution, and to aid in training of graduate and postdoctoral students.  The ultimate aim of these investigations, of quantitative predictions of transition to instability, would, if achieved, be of direct and practical use at the level of engineering, in chemical, manufacturing, and other processes.",Kevin Zumbrun|

These systems are closely related mathematically, all sharing common features with the Navier-Stokes equations of compressible fluid flow, and all serving as models for physical phenomena arising in concrete applications, including the flow of compressible fluids and gases, shallow water theory, magnetohydrodynamics, combustion theory, and semiconductor modeling.  The primary goal is to develop precise, mathematically certain statements about these models by applying techniques from the fields of analysis and partial differential equations.  This research is related to the underlying physical science in several ways:  first, it can validate, determine limits on the range of applicability, or in some cases invalidate the models;  second, rigorous mathematical analysis of the models can lead to deeper understanding of the physical phenomena;  finally, by determining topologies in which the models are well-posed and elucidating underlying reasons for this structure, the work can set the stage for the development of computer procedures for the effective computation of approximate solutions.    The proposer will study mathematical questions concerning important models of compressible fluids and materials.  These models arise in a broad range of applications, including supersonic flight, dynamic meteorology, semiconductor theory, and combustion processes.  While the main goal in constructing these models is to achieve a predictive capability, they are far too complicated to be solved in any explicit sense.  On the other hand, adequate approximate solutions can frequently be generated by computational methods.  However, the intelligent design of such methods depends crucially on understanding of why solutions do exist, in what sense, and in what ways they are sensitive to noise in the data.  The project will provide such a rigorous mathematical analysis for these models and determine possible limits on their range of applicability, thereby setting the stage for the development of computer procedures for the effective computation of approximate solutions.",David Hoff|

In this proposal, both genetic and ecological approaches will be employed to estimate the fitness effects of eight genes (or small chromosomal segments that contain them) that control differences between two sunflower species.  The validity of these estimates will be verified by analyzing the movement of these genes between the two species when they hybridize in nature.    The proposed activities are anticipated to have broader impacts through research training of underrepresented groups, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. In addition, the genetic materials created in this grant will be made freely available to other researchers.

Ticks also carry a variety of non-pathogenic symbiotic bacteria.  Most of this microbial diversity has only become apparent with the advent of powerful molecular tools.  Preliminary evidence suggests that these symbionts can exclude pathogens, reducing human disease risk. Using molecular genetic methods, the microbial communities of medically-important tick species will be quantified and statistical tests will be applied to test the strength and direction of microbial interactions. In addition, microbial interactions will be incorporated into epidemiological models to determine conditions where microorganisms within ticks interfere with or amplify one another.    The results of this research will contribute to a general understanding of how microbial interactions affect pathogen prevalence, disease epidemiology, and human disease risk. This research will also explore new techniques for quantifying pathogen populations and microbial communities, and contribute significantly to scientific education at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels.

This project is focused on one of biology's deepest mysteries - the evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination. The investigative team consists of cell biologists, ecologists, parasitologists, quantitative geneticists, genomicists, and mathematicians. The study organism, the planktonic microcrustacean Daphnia pulex, provides an exceptional array of opportunities for recombination research that is unavailable with any other system: a wide range of recombination intensities among natural populations, the presence of multiple sexual and asexual lineages, a powerful set of genomic tools, well understood ecology, ease of experimental manipulation, and a ""living-fossil"" record that can be resurrected from lake sediments. Specific goals include: 1) characterization of the genetic changes associated with the transition from meiotic to mitotic progeny production; 2) evaluation of whether the mutation rate (including the activity of mobile-genetic elements) is affected by meiosis; 3) a test of the hypothesis that mutation load accumulates in the absence of recombination; 4) evaluation of the extent to which recombination modifies the range of variation upon which natural selection acts; and 5) a test of the hypothesis that host-parasite evolution drives the evolution of recombination and sex. These studies will be informed by an integrated research program involving high-throughput sequencing, microarray analysis, and quantitative-genetic surveys. Guided by the empirical results, mathematical models will also be developed for understanding the evolutionary fates of genomic features of asexual organisms. Finally, the results of this study will be integrated into an emerging evolutionary framework suggesting that many aspects of the genomic architecture of multicellular organisms arose passively in response to mildly deleterious mutation accumulation in populations with small effective sizes.  Broader Impacts. The potential impacts of this project on science, society, and education are numerous. First, an undergraduate program will help instill an interdisciplinary philosophy while broadening career choices for students from multiple institutions, with a particular focus on minority recruitment. Second, the research program will be tightly integrated with the newly founded Daphnia Genomics Consortium, an international group of scientists from across the life sciences (http://daphnia.cgb.indiana.edu/).

The project involves the investigation of the relationship between prairie plants and one group of soil organisms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF).  AMF are an ancient lineage of fungi that associate with the roots of most land plants.  Typically they form mutualistic relationships with their host plants.  AMF take up soil nutrients and transport them back to the host plant roots.  In exchange host plants transport carbohydrates to the AMF.  Through this project, soil organisms that are likely to facilitate the establishment of prairie plant species in restorations will be identified and grown.  These organisms will then be tested to determine their benefit to a variety of prairie plant species and their growth in association with plants.  The project will also test the growth response of plants associated with AMF species isolated from undisturbed prairie as well as nearby disturbed plant communities.  In addition, she will develop molecular markers to identify AMF species within the roots of host plants.  Through these studies inferences into the role of the AMF community in plant community dynamics will be made. This research will contribute to basic knowledge of a ubiquitous group of soil organisms and may suggest practical approaches to accelerate the restoration of the diversity of prairie plant communities and perhaps other native plant communities.

The collection consists of over 12,500 different genetic stocks, most genetically marked with visible, lethal or sterile mutations (41% of the collection), other alleles (11%), chromosome aberrations (20%), or transposon insertions (18%).  The remaining 10% consist of special-purpose stocks (10%), including those used for rapid mapping.  Information about stocks is incorporated into FlyBase, the primary Drosophila community database, and is available from the Center's web site.  This provides the community of users with full access to up-to-date information about stocks available from the collection.  In addition, Center scientists are available to answer questions and provide advice on the use of these materials.  Strains in the collection are in demand, with an average of 115,000 stocks a year requested from the Center.  Academic researchers receive over 95% of the samples distributed.  This resource contributes to scientific progress by assuring that a wide variety of documented strains of current research value are readily available to all researchers, and by promoting the effective use of available research materials through information services.  Drosophila resource activities impact all areas of research that make use of Drosophila studies.  Among others, these include gene regulation, cell biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, behavioral biology, population biology, ecology and evolution.",Kathleen Matthews|Thomas Kaufman|Kevin Cook

In East African woody savannahs dominated by several species of acacia tree, each acacia species releases its pollen at specific, but different, times during the day and insect pollinators closely track the pollen release patterns of the trees.  The goal of this study is to determine whether natural selection is acting to structure pollen release times in acacia communities in response to competition for pollinator services.  The study will focus on one acacia species within the larger community and will combine genetic analyses and field experiments in Kenya to determine (i) the effect of different pollen release times and pollinators on seed production, (ii) the importance of self-fertilization to reproduction, and (iii) the distances over which pollinators carry acacia pollen.         The results of this study will enhance understanding of how plants adapt to their biotic environment and how plant-pollinator interactions could contribute to the formation of new plant species.  This study will bolster understanding of these interactions in a widespread and understudied ecosystem that has great ecological and economic importance in East Africa.

However, it is difficult to study their effects when they are unpredictable in space and time. This research will determine the effect of periodical cicadas on the dynamics of forest systems. Periodical cicadas emerge every 17 or 13 years, depending upon species, after extended below-ground feeding on tree roots. The 2004 emergence is likely to be one of the largest insect outbreaks on Earth, providing the rare opportunity to critically examine the impact of a major biological disturbance. Preliminary work suggests that cicadas have strong preferences among tree species, favor young successional forest sites, and have chronic effects on tree growth. We will contrast forest composition in high density vs. cicada-free sites, and will manipulate cicada colonization by netting blocks of early successional forest. Long-term effects of cicadas on different host species will be examined through the analysis of tree rings. This research will improve our understanding of disturbance events and forest dynamics, and may serve as a useful model for other, less predicable biotic disturbances. Further, this research provides a unique opportunity to educate the local community about forest systems, and to actively involve students in an exciting event that incorporates ""science as process"" learning activities.",Keith Clay|

For applications to quantum computing the investigators aim to  understand how TQFTs would arise from microscopic many-body quantum  physics.   The proposed program is based on work of Turaev and  Moore-Seiberg-Walker which  essentially establish a one-one correspondence of TQFTs with modular  tensor categories.    Topological quantum field theory emerged in the 1980s from the study of  three distinct riddles:  the relation of the Jones polynomials of knots to  3-dimensional topology, the fractional Quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in  condensed matter physics, and the infrared limit of 2-dimensional  conformal field theory in string theory.  The connection between  topological quantum field theory and quantum computing was first explored  by Freedman and Kitaev in late 1990s.  Their work opened up the  possibility of building an inherently fault-tolerant quantum  computer---a topological quantum computer.   Such a computer would  exploit new states of matter closely related to TQFT.  Examples of such  ""topological states of matter"" include electron gases confined between the  interface of two semi-conductors which exhibit the FQHE.  The extreme  physical conditions for fractional quantum Hall electron gases make it  impractical to build a topological quantum computer from such materials.  To discover or fabricate new materials capable of universal quantum  computation under practical physical conditions is a goal of the proposed  program.  The problem of classifying TQFTs (or equivalently topological  states of matter) is analogous to the problem of classifying the  chemical elements, and can be used to identify appropriate candidates  for quantum computing.  The proper characterization of materials capable  of universal quantum computing, not to speak of their actual fabrication,  could open up a new chapter in many-body quantum physics.  The  possible applications of such new materials are hard to predict,  but would definitely not to be limited to quantum computing.",Michael Larsen|Zhenghan Wang|Richard Stong|Michael Freedman

The set of equivalence classes   forms what is called the concordance group of knots, first studied in   the early 1960s.   It is known that this group is countable, abelian,   and that it maps onto Levine's algebraic concordance group, which is   isomorphic to an infinite direct sum of cyclic groups of infinite order   and of order 2 and 4.  The kernel of this map is infinitely generated.    A main goal of the proposal is the continued study of the concordance   group and relationships between three-dimensional properties of knots,   such as symmetry and genus, and their properties in the concordance   group.  Specific topics include understanding the algebraic structure   of the kernel of Levine's map (in particular the part of the kernel   generated by knots of Alexander polynomial one), torsion in the   concordance group, and the splitting of Levine's homomorphism.  To   pursue this study the principal investigator will develop and apply   methods coming from the theory of Heegaard Floer homology as defined by   Oszvath and Szabo.  Other topics of study under the proposal relate to   the interplay between the fundamental groups of 4-manifolds and their   topological structure: for instance, a continued investigation of the   Hausmann-Weinberger invariant of a group, the minimal Euler   characteristic of a closed 4-manifold having that group as its   fundamental group, and its generalizations, will be pursued.    The goal of this proposal is the study of knots.  From a   three-dimensional perspective, questions about knots have been studied   for over a hundred years.  More recently it has been recognized that   the structure of a four-dimensional space, a four-manifold, is   connected to properties of classical knots that can be associated to   that four-manifold.  A main focus of this proposal is  the study of   those properties of knots that are of relevant to four-dimensional   topology; many of these properties are encapsulated in something called   the concordance group of knots.  Questions regarding this concordance   group offer test cases and motivation for the further development of   techniques from general four-manifold theory.  In addition, the study   of concordance brings to the fore new and fascinating questions in the   realm of classical three-dimensional knot theory, relating for instance   to questions of knot symmetry and genus.",Charles Livingston|

This orogen has developed over the past few million years as the Yakutat block, a continental-oceanic terrane,  has attempted subduction beneath the eastern end of the Aleutian arc-trench system.  The ~500 km-long, 150 km-wide St. Elias mountain range is the product of the dynamic balance between rapid uplift induced by crustal convergence and rapid exhumation by a regional system of large, fast-moving temperate glaciers.  Most sediments are deposited either on a broad shelf or in deepsea fans and provide a complete record of the tectonic, climatic, erosional, and eustatic events that have accompanied the orogeny.      The overarching goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive model for the St. Elias orogen that accounts for the interaction of regional plate tectonic processes, structural development, and rapid erosion.  The focus of the study is on the partitioning of deformation within the system from upper mantle flow to near-surface faulting and exhumation.  The study will investigate the geodynamics of oblique collision under a set of conditions that will allow the PIs to address several important and fundamental questions:    -	Has intense Quaternary glacial erosion redistributed mass in the orogen sufficiently to change regional deformational patterns, and has focused erosion along deep glacial valleys been sufficient to localize crustal strains?  -	How is deformation partitioned into lithospheric shortening and uplift versus lateral extrusion of the detached crust, and does intense erosion influence this partitioning?  -	Is the orogeny driven primarily by subduction of a buoyant oceanic plateau or by collision of a small microcontinental block attached to allochthonous ocean crust?    Addressing these questions has broad implications for understanding the geodynamics of oblique collision in general, the role of different mechanisms in development of far-field orogenic effects, and the control of erosion on development of slip partitioning during oblique convergence.  The project also has general implications for how subduction/accretion of small continental terranes versus oceanic plateaus contribute to deformation of the continents, and ultimately the fate of these fragments in construction of the crustal collage which is typical of virtually all continents.  Specifically, the P.I.s propose a multidisciplinary approach involving seismologists (subsurface imaging and seismicity), geologists, geodesists, glaciologists, geochronologists, and geodynamic modelers.",Gary Pavlis|

Quorum sensing regulates a range of functions, often those involved with host interactions such as pathogenesis and symbiosis, in response to bacterial population density via signal molecules.  Once the signal molecule (e.g. acylated homoserine lactones or AHLs for the Proteobacteria) reaches a threshold concentration, it effectively binds and activates a transcription factor(s), which regulates expression of genes responsible for collective bacterial activities.  Although the role of AHL quorum sensing in microbial systems is relatively well accepted, mechanistic studies of the regulatory circuitry, including production and diffusion of AHLs, activation and inhibition of AHL-responsive transcription factors, and control of gene expression, are still at an early stage.  The aim of this project is to examine the structural and biochemical basis of quorum sensing in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a model plant pathogen and a premier system for mechanistic studies of quorum sensing, using a range of genetic, biochemical and structural methods particularly protein X-ray crystallography.  In A. tumefaciens quorum sensing requires the AHL-responsive TraR transcription factor, and under non-inducing conditions this protein is inhibited by the TraM anti-activator through formation of a highly stable heterocomplex.  The objectives of this research are as follows.  First, structural and functional studies of TraM, based on the PIs' recently solved crystal structure of TraM, will be continued.  These efforts will dissect the biochemical and functional complexity of TraM activity.  Second, the TraM inhibitory mechanism will be studied by determining the structure of the anti-activator heterocomplex (TraM-TraR-AHL) using X-ray crystallography, complemented with biochemical analysis of this complex using biophysical and kinetic techniques.  Third, functional studies will be performed to test the predictions revealed through the co-crystal structure on TraM inhibition of TraR function.  These studies will represent the first structural studies on mechanistic aspects of transcription factor inhibition in a quorum sensing pathway, and the first kinetic characterizations on the molecular events of TraM antagonism on TraR.  Results from this work will provide a comprehensive structure-function understanding of TraM-TraR interaction.  These findings could lead to novel approaches for limiting the spread of infective A. tumefaciens in agricultural situations by the deliberate intervention into their quorum sensing.  These studies will also have significant impact in the area of microbial cell-to-cell communication, and may help develop novel approaches such as the design of chemical compounds that interfere with bacterial communication, to control and combat microbial invasion.

The experiments outlined in this proposal incorporate a combination of genetic, molecular and physiological approaches to understand the mechanism of chloroplast movements.

Rapid advances and deployment of cyberinfrastructure and sensor networks have created opportunities for new knowledge of ecological systems and their role in global environmental processes.  Expanding current networks and developing new networks capable of addressing the spatial and temporal variability of important ecological processes such as lake metabolism at regional to global scales will require novel technical improvements in an architecture that transports data from sensors to databases, allows dynamic control of sensors and reconfiguration of the network, addresses data quality assurance, provides data access and query to distributed data in the network as well as to other relevant datasets, and provides tools for analysis. Specifically this project has two major technical goals:  1. Develop new methods and tools to help automate the updating of data flows from dynamically deployed sensors to publicly accessible biological databases.  2. Develop a suite of new algorithms and software for analysis of biological information to automate detection (real-time) of events based on data from sensors and databases, with applications to classification of signals to biological or physical events or to sensor failure, allowing rapid response.  The dissemination of analytical tools and framework developed will be useful to existing research projects, evolving environmental observing systems such as National Ecological Observatory Network, networks, agencies, international partners, and K-16 teachers.  Graduate and under graduate students will participate in the project.  Both software tools and basic research data from this project will be incorporated into existing and ongoing professional development resources for teachers and instructional resources for students in grades 6-12.",Donald McMullen|Kenneth Chiu

Even more astounding, the majority of speakers in the world can do this in two different languages; they can flexibly talk and listen using often very different linguistic systems.  To understand how this is accomplished, Dr. Kenneth de Jong and a research team will examine how Koreans produce and perceive consonants in English and how their developing skills relate to other skills having to do with language structure.  These tasks require them to identify and produce the sounds, and to be able to break up English utterances into syllables and to determine where stress lies.  Their abilities in doing these tasks will tell us how tightly connected the various perception, motor, and classification skills are related to each other.  The research group will also determine how their English perception skills rely on their Korean perception skills by having them classify the English sounds with Korean labels.  Put together, these studies will show how the various skills of speaking, listening, and generalizing fit together in the learning of a second language.      The research project will make a significant contribution to the fields of second language acquisition and of phonetics by examining a number of different perception and production abilities in a good sampling of the English consonant system.  Most previous studies examine small numbers of different segments and rarely examine production and perception skills in the same individuals.  This project will particularly determine how systematic effects found for one set of sounds are across the larger system.  It will also systematically determine the effect of prosodic organization on both production and perception skills.  The second language acquirers, since they are in the process of rapid change, give a window into the structure of speaking and perception skills, and how they relate to each other.",Kenneth de Jong|

In temperate climates, the prolonged cold temperature of winter provides a seasonal landmark for biennial and winter-annual plants.  These species (which include many crop plants) contain a block to flowering such that flowering is prevented prior to winter and promoted in the spring.  The promotion of flowering by prolonged cold treatment (as winter) is known as vernalization.  Significant headway has been made in understanding the process of vernalization in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  In Arabidopsis, vernalization is caused by the interaction of two genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which acts to block flowering, and FRIGIDA (FRI), which is required for high levels of FLC expression.  Cold causes an epigenetic repression of FLC gene expression, likely at the level of chromatin modification via histone acetylation.  To dissect the regulatory interactions between FLC and FRI, an exhaustive mutant screen has been conducted.  This screen led to the isolation of genes that are required for the upregulation of FLC by FRI (termed FS genes).  The purpose of this proposal is to characterize the role of the FS genes in flowering-time regulation, using genetic, molecular genetic, and biochemical approaches.  These studies will primarily involve: 1) double mutant analyses to characterize the genetic relationships among the various FS genes; 2) yeast two-hydrid screens to identify interactors among the various FS proteins; and 3) microarray analyses to isolate downstream targets of the FS gene products.  The role of FS in other early-flowing accessions of Arabidopsis will also be examined.    Broader Impacts: Because changes in gene expression through chromatin modification have been documented in a broad range of eukaryotes, including yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans, and humans, there is a high likelihood that this research will provide new knowledge that will be of broad scientific interest.  This work also has potential agricultural applications, inasmuch as most crop species are biennials and the ability to manipulate their flowering time might provide avenues for crop improvement.  In terms of human resources, the research will provide a fertile training ground for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Plant-development education modules will be also developed for both undergraduate genetics students and the public at large.",Scott Michaels|

A major focus   is to deal with complexes of more general topological type than many of   the prevalent methods within combinatorics were designed to handle, e.g.   in new techniques for proving connectivity lower bounds. The   investigator will continue her ongoing effort to develop techniques for   constructing discrete Morse functions with few critical cells, with   emphasis on order complexes of partially ordered sets and on related   free resolutions (both for monomial ideals, and also for resolving a   residue field over a monomial or toric ring). Substantial improvement,   at least for order complexes, will likely require better understanding   of the very rich structure governing gradient paths between critical   cells. In related work, she also plans to study Poincare' series for   free resolutions over monomial and toric rings, for instance trying to   better understand for toric rings which such Poincare' series will be   rational. She also intends to study modular elements in (non-geometric)   lattices and to try to generalize lexicographic shellability to skeleta   of complexes, motivated again by potential applications to constructing   small free resolutions and also to bounding graph chromatic number (via   better understanding of characteristic polynomial).     Topological combinatorics, and in particular connectivity lower bounds,   have in the past been used to determine and verify complexity theory   lower bounds on the running time for certain types of algorithms, to   deduce results in commutative algebra about relations among polynomials   via the theory of free resolutions, and also to give lower bounds on the   number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph in such a   way that no two vertices sharing an edge are the same color. The   investigator is interested in further developing combinatorial   techniques (such as a recently introduced discrete version of Morse   theory) for studying topological structure, letting potential   applications guide the way. Morse theory is a classical theory which   analyzes the topological structure of an object by viewing the object   progressively from bottom to top, keeping track of essential data at   those moments in time where fundamental changes in structure take   place; recently Robin Forman introduced a discrete version of this   seemingly inherently continuous notion. One of the investigator's   major focuses is to develop to practical machinery for making this   theoretically very powerful tool convenient to use on real (and in many cases very complex) examples.",Patricia Hersh|

These include the understanding of  time-dependent formulation and of thermal fluctuations, together  with the elucidation of the behavior of superconductors near the  sample's boundary.  Other problems studied are related to  transport phenomena in thin wires with Joesphson junctions.  Such  structures are crucial in several basic superconducting devices.   The investigator suggests a research direction that leads to the  introduction of novel junctions.

While  the main motivation is to consider such transport processes in  superconductors, these types of problems are relevant to many  areas.  For example, quantum wires are among the current leading  models for quantum computers, microchannel chips are developing  into fast and efficient tools in chemical analysis, etc.  The work  in this area will have an impact on certain directions in  nanotechnology.

In combination with Teichmuller theory, cone  metrics have been applied to existence and classification problems of  mimimal surfaces. Noded surfaces are natural limits of  Riemann  surfaces under conformal pinching of curves. They have been used to  construct families of minimal surfaces that degenerate to a suitable  noded limit, using the implicit function theorem. We aim for a  description of the noded limits of minimal surfaces as geometric  limits of flat cone metrics. This adds a third type of limit to the  formerly considered geometric and conformal limits. The conformal  limits ignore the minimal surface information and consider only the  Riemann surface limit, while the geometric limit retain the minimal  surface nature but loose conformal and topological information by  rescaling the surfaces in space. The new cone metric limit will  incorporate both types of information. We hope that this description  will lead to new examples and classification results. This research  will be backed by numerical and graphical experiments based on a  minimal surface library currently under development.    Minimal surfaces are mathematical abstractions of 2-dimensional shapes  that arise at different scales in nature: We are all familiar with  soap film experiments, but such surfaces also have been observed at  the nano scale as interfaces between block copolymers. Their  mathematical properties are important for understanding the physical  nature of new fabrics. The physical goal to minimize surface tension  translates into a mathematical equation which has been of interest for  over 250 years: The minimal surface equation is just at the border  between what we understand by general theory and what we only can  analyze numerically. Any advance at this point will most likely have  its effects on other equations from mathematical physics and  engineering. The methods which are being used to investigate  minimal  surfaces range from geometric analysis to numerical mathematics.  Recent theoretical advances from partial differential equations and  Teichmuller theory allow us to study 'extreme' minimal surfaces which  comparable to soap films that nearly break under deformations.  Understanding these extreme surfaces not only helps us to analyze the  examples we have by breaking them apart into simpler pieces but also  allows the construction of exciting new surfaces by putting suitable  pieces together. The computer experiments we conduct require elaborate  symbolic manipulations of the formulas involved, high-precision  numerical computations to get accurate 3-dimensional surface data, and  high performance computer graphics to visualize the actual surfaces.",Matthias Weber|

The motivation for these projects comes from actual experiments: large-scale   experiments of high-energy lasers show important enerngy losses; detonation   waves are seen to develop longitudinal instabilities. This project will   contribute to a rigorous mathematical analysis of relevant model equations   describing these phenomena. Such an analysis is a key step in the development of   predictive tools, as a deep mathematical understanding of the models is needed   in order to devise efficient numerical simulations.",Kevin Zumbrun|Benjamin Texier

This project is a comprehensive study of gaseous and stellar dynamics in low mass galaxies, to examine kinematic constraints on morphological evolution between the different dwarf galaxy classes, because it has been hypothesized that these classes simply represent different evolutionary states.  The observations will exploit a relatively unexplored region of parameter space to investigate the feasibility of passive morphological transformation, specifically considering whether angular momentum regulates star formation activity, the role of environment in the initiation of a starburst phase, and the connection between low redshift dwarf galaxies and the rapidly evolving population of faint blue galaxies at intermediate redshift.    This program will have a broad impact by advancing discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning.

One of the fundamental problems in modern  hydrogeology and geochemistry is the orders of magnitude discrepancy between silicate dissolution  rates derived from watersheds and soil profiles versus those derived from laboratory measurements.  This large discrepancy indicates our lack of basic understanding of the fundamental physical and  chemical processes controlling silicate dissolution kinetics in nature.  The proposed study will test two hypotheses to explain this discrepancy: (1) A large part of the  discrepancy between in situ and laboratory rates results from different saturation states under which  feldspars dissolve in natural systems and in most laboratory experiments. While most laboratory  experiments attempt to measure the rate of a single congruent dissolution reaction far from equilibrium,  field studies measure in situ rates amid a complex web of reaction networks and at a condition very  close to equilibrium with respect to feldspars. Among these reactions is the precipitation of clay, which  removes solutes from groundwater and hence promotes continued feldspar dissolution. However,  contrary to the prevailing assumption that clays are at equilibrium with groundwater, we believe that  clay precipitation is much slower than feldspar dissolution, and hence groundwater chemistry is  constrained to be close to equilibrium with feldspars. Over time, a steady state of groundwater  chemistry is reached with near constant rates of feldspar dissolution and clay precipitation; and (2) A  leached layer forms on weathered feldspar surfaces, which is an important part of how silicate  dissolution occurs in nature and must be considered in rate laws that properly describe reaction  kinetics.  The proposed study will test the first hypothesis by analyzing dissolved Al3+ concentrations in  the aquifer, evaluating saturation indices and their variations along a flow path, and numerical  geochemical modeling to elucidate the complex network of reactions associated with feldspar  dissolution in aquifers. We aim to establish a theoretical framework for interpreting laboratory  experiments and field data. To test the second hypothesis, we will characterize microstructures and  detailed chemistry at the feldspar-clay interfaces using an atomic scale Field Emission Gun  Transmission Electron Microscope. The overall objectives are to advance our understanding of the two  key possibilities for discrepancies between laboratory and field rates: the diminishing thermodynamic  drive and the characteristics of weathered feldspar surfaces.  Broader Impacts  The PIs will integrate the research activities into undergraduate and graduate-level geology  courses. A summer mentorship program will sponsor undergraduate students, particularly from  underrepresented groups, to conduct research in the PI's laboratories. Partnerships with the National  Energy Technology Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory will be developed to facilitate  dissemination and applications of the research results to the carbon sequestration and environmental  restoration programs.  Groundwater is a key source of drinking water and is essential to life on Earth. Groundwater  also represents 98% of fresh water readily available to humans. Therefore, reaction rates in aquifers are  critical to water resource and water quality management, waste disposal, and global warming  mitigation strategies. The findings from this project will therefore contribute to our understanding of  the environment, and help to build a scientific basis for environmental policies and strategies.",Chen Zhu|Hiromi Konishi

Where tectonic plates converge, relatively low density crust may become delaminated from its denser mantle keel, or slices of felsic crust may indent or interfinger as crustal wedges. In this case indenting or even mutually indenting structures may lead to thickened crust. The structure of tectonic wedging has received increasing support from the interpretations of geophysical data, but interpenetrating crustal slivers have rarely been observed in the field. Consequently the mechanisms and even the confirmation of interpenetrating wedges remain speculative.    In this collaboration between Indiana University and Brigham Young University geologists are making one of the first attempts to directly characterize and identify the causes of syn-collisional wedging of upper crust from lower crust using surface outcrop. They have discovered an example of tectonic wedging in a tilted lower crustal profile. The outcrops in coastal Connecticut exposure rocks formerly mapped as fold nappes within the Avalon terrane. In addition to Avalonian rocks derived from juvenile sources, our pilot study of neodymium and lead isotopes is showing that the structurally lowest orthogneisses is derived from ancient crustal rocks that correlate with the Gander terrane. Their work in this region shows that Avalonian rocks both overlie Gander basement rocks and underlie rocks known to the north to rest conformably over Gander basement. Thus this map pattern defines the geometry of a tectonic wedge.     The goals of the project are (1) to confirm the identity and correlation of Avalon and Gander zone rocks in southern coastal New England with correlative rocks in maritime Canada where they are well characterized, (2) to test the extent and distribution of Avalon and Gander zone rocks in other inliers of New England, (3) to test single vs. double indenting models, (4) to monitor the timing and rate of approach of Avalon in the cover terranes by establishing the time of quenching of the cover Gander terranes, and (5) to assess the rheology of the rocks in the terrane boundary. Methods to be used include characterization of outcrop in the field, analysis of major and trace element compositions to identify intrusive igneous rocks, and neodymium and lead isotopic analysis of theses igneous rocks to ascertain the origins of the initial magmas.",Robert Wintsch|

In recent work  the investigators and their collaborators have identified critical wave  numbers expressed as averages of different norms of the solution to the  Navier-Stokes equations (NSE).  These wave numbers provide necessary, and  nearly sufficient conditions for the Kraichnan theory to hold.  This team  has also localized to some extent the global attractor of the NSE in a  plane spanned by two of these norms (one being the energy), to help  understand which driving forces produce these conditions.  The proposed  work will combine this analysis with computational optimization to zero in  on such forces, and then study in detail the turbulent features they  produce.  The mathematical treatment of turbulence is largely driven by  the heuristic theories of Kolmogorov, Batchelor and Kraichnan.  The  approach taken in projecting the attractor however, seems to be entirely  new.  The information provided by this analysis will guide the  computational component which otherwise would be confronted with a vast  landscape of possible driving forces to consider.    Turbulence is readily observed in three-dimensional physical space  domains.  Most people think of a bumpy plane rides (in this case the  domain is the volume around the airplane).  Like the swirls generated by  rocks in a stream, rapidly changing patterns form in the air around the  plane.  Turbulence theories do not attempt to predict the precise  development of these patterns, but rather find (a) consistent laws which  describe how, on average, energy is transferred to smaller length scales,  and (b) critical length scales at which this this phenomenon changes.   True 2-D flows in nature are less prevalent.  The most prominent example,  the earth's atmosphere, is actually a thin 3-D domain, whose behavior  approaches that of a 2-D flow.  The fate of energy over different length  scales is more complicated for 2-D flow, though that of 3-D flow is in  some sense embedded into it.  Though 2-D experiments are difficult to  carry out in the laboratory, they allow for much finer study on a  computer.  Of all 2-D flows, the one studied in this project is arguably  the most amenable to analysis and efficient simulation.  Yet it is  fundamental, not only to 2-D and nearly 2-D flows such as the atmosphere,  but also to 3-D turbulence due to universality.",Michael Jolly|Ciprian Foias

Such time series implicitly contain valuable information about the connectivity and regulatory structure of the underlying genetic or biochemical network mechanism. The extraction of this information is a challenging task because it requires the development of new mathematical and computational methods of nonlinear estimation that involve iterative search algorithms. Priming these algorithms with high-quality initial guesses can great accelerate the search process.    Even when full genomic sequences for an organism are available, the functions and  interactions of only a small number of gene components are clear. Presently, the functions of uncharacterized proteins have usually been inferred on the basis of sequence similarities, common structural motifs, gene order, gene fusion events, or similarities in gene expression. The proposal goal is to develop a new method for functional predictions based on the role of the gene in networks. This method allow us to perform functional predictions for proteins independent of homologies in structure or sequence, and provide a way to characterize proteins that have not yet been studied using published biological data from high-throughput technologies.    The methodology will be applicable to any organism, including humans, where  only three to five percent of gene function is known. As we better understand the functions of genes and proteins in a network context, we can better predict and control their responses to internal and external perturbations. For the foreseeable future, the type of modeling predictions will likely be one of the many inputs into the decision making process in the pharmaceutical industry, and biomedical sciences.

Until recently, individual labs have simply imposed local homogeneity of format and procedure, and not stored lab-dependent metadata. This ad hoc system is limited, however, as crystallographers begin to cross between labs to accomplish their research objectives, and as increasing numbers and sizes of output data streams leave less time for each investigation. Local workflow must be made explicit, procedures must be formally described, and the history and assemblages of data expressed in an open, shareable way. Creation and management of complete, accessible records for each experiment is critical, as well as heterogeneity in data acquisition and management across the field.     To meet that need, this project will develop a framework of web service interfaces and data and metadata systems addressing the whole spectrum of crystallography. Project participants and collaborators will leverage existing projects, such as Reciprocal Net and Common Instrument Middleware Architecture, that address narrower issues in the problem domain. The CGF will also draw on collaborating projects with overlapping areas of interest, such as the UK-based Comb-e-Chem project. The resulting framework will be a useful environment for crystallographic investigations and an extensible platform on which new web-based applications can be built.    The CGF project involves the classic problem of dealing with heterogeneity in data, procedures, and instruments in the crystallography application space, and another classic problem in integrating the entire data collection, transport, and curation requirements of the domain into a seamless beginning to end system. The challenge is to create a virtualization system that manages heterogeneity in more than a single aspect and to provide vertical integration using only open, extensible, and interoperable standards and methodologies.    While the project constitutes research into pertinent computer science problems, the plan for performing the research is centered on producing a product (the CGF) that will immediately be useful in addressing emerging technical problems in the field of X-ray crystallography. Within crystallography, one of the specific goals is to make structural results accessible that might otherwise never be seen, and so the CGF will help increase the body of scientific knowledge and improve the return on federal investment in the large numbers of x-ray diffractometers and associated instruments nationwide. Although the project targets specifically a few hundreds of crystallography labs worldwide, the software and methods created in it are intended to be reusable for any science moving from individual lab practices to a shared, global collaboratory system. In sciences such as high-energy physics and astronomy, the scientists have long shared single, unique, large instruments and had to create shared data management and instrument metadata.

Kim  Indiana University    Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) will be one of the leading technologies in future warfare and emergency rescue to reduce the threats to personnel and to enhance the efficiency of their missions.  The vehicular industry is exploiting the MANET technology for enabling road safety and commercial applications. A communication device in the MANET is capable of being a packet forwarder to provide rapid inter-connection without any stationary infrastructure.  Mobile nodes are supposed to cooperate in order to achieve overall objective in a reconnaissance mission in the nature of their applications.  There are, however, very few research results on cooperative mobility models.  Even if there are, their theoretical foundations are not  known and the similarity to real movement are neither.    The PI, Prof. Kim, proposes to analyze the characteristics of node movement in ad hoc networks to investigate the theoretical aspects of cooperative node movemett.  Among those characteristics are the distance and signal power between mobile nodes, the number of neighbor nodes within a transmission range, the logical link duration, and their cooperating strategies.  Utilizing the characteristics, he will develop a new cooperative movement model that closely describe a realistic node movement pattern.  In addition, the project will use  stochastic process models to investigate an analytic framework of movement models and to describe different mobility models including entity mobility models and group mobility models.  The framework will provide a tool to compare two or more dissimilar mobility models in fair ways regardless of detailed deployment environments.    Intellectual Merits  Existing mathematical models can describe only a specific mobility model, mostly a random walk model. The PI intends to build a uniform mathematical framework that can characterize different mobility models  including random walk, random waypoint, and some group mobility models.  Due to the lack of the mathematical foundation, MANET studies focus on exercising extensive simulation using a limited number of  mobility models.  It is possible to generate biased results validated only for the given mobility models, which leads to an invalid conclusion.  The analytic model proposed in the project will give a general insight to the nodal movement and a capability to predict the resulting topological change.     Broad Impact   To the large scale of mobile ad hoc networks, the ability to analyze node movement and to predict topological changes due to the movement will give thorough understanding on the availability of logical link and hence the accessibility of multi-hop path in MANET. The project abstracts geometrical properties of node movements so that it gives a generality for comparing different mobility models in a uniform constitution that makes it possible to discover their resemblances and differences.",Dongsoo Kim|

Using perturbation methods and numerical simulation, this project aims to better understand the mechanisms by which ventricular arrhythmias are generated and sustained.  The transition from tachycardia to fibrillation has been characterized as proceeding through the breakdown of a spiral wave of transmembrane potential into multiple spirals and finally into a spatiotemporally disorganized state.  Despite this important connection, many questions about basic properties of spiral waves are as yet unanswered.  While most of the analytical work to date has treated it as a homogeneous, isotropic excitable medium, in fact the heart is a highly complicated, heterogeneous physical system with strong anisotropy and nontrivial geometry.  On the other hand, numerical simulations of electric potential propagation in the heart using realistic cellular kinetics and geometries remain computationally challenging and difficult to validate.  The main thrust of this project is to distinguish the role in the initiation and breakdown of spirals of the ""passive"" properties of cardiac tissue as a conducting medium, described as a bidomain (consisting of intra- and extra-cellular domains) with rotating anisotropy, from that of its ""active"" properties determined by cardiac cell electrophysiology.  This work will proceed on two fronts: (1) extension of the existing body of work on perturbation analyses of scroll waves in isotropic excitable media to include the rotating anisotropy and bidomain description of cardiac tissue; and (2) construction and implementation of a minimally realistic fiber architecture model of the left ventricle for computationally tractable numerical studies.  The combined analytical and computational approach makes possible a basic understanding of the role of geometry and fiber architecture in spiral wave propagation and breakup.  Further development of both lines of inquiry has the potential to address the role of excitation-contraction coupling. The project will provide a training ground for graduate students in an interdisciplinary area of research, involving analytical techniques, advanced numerical methods and high performance computing.    A better understanding of electrical properties of cardiac tissue and their role in the development of cardiac arrhythmias could lead to clinical treatments and preventative procedures.  Insights from analytical and computational studies of both idealized and realistic models of electrical wave propagation in the heart are essential for understanding cardiac arrhythmias at a fundamental level, and for making direct contact with experimental work and clinical experience in this area.  The work that will be undertaken in this project can be viewed as a step toward these goals. The nature of the subject and the research tools that will be used provide opportunities for outreach and education, as well as for the general conveyance of the role of the physical and mathematical sciences in biological and biomedical research to the public at large.",Sima Setayeshgar|

Differences may arise because one sex is subject to greater reproductive competition (sexual selection) or because the sexes differ in their ecology (natural selection).  Because males and females share a common genome, they are also subject to correlated responses to selection, which occur when genetic variants favored by selection in one sex ('like father, like son') are carried along in the other sex ('like father, like daughter').  Correlated responses may serve as an evolutionary constraint if the attributes that are beneficial to one sex are disadvantageous to the other sex.  	Steroid hormones are among the proximate mechanisms that lead to sex differences.  They may act early in development to organize tissues or later in life to activate trait expression.  When hormonal effects are similar in males and females, there is potential for correlated responses to selection.  The focus of this proposal is the steroid hormone testosterone (T) and its integrating effect on sex differences in adult males and females of a songbird species, the dark-eyed junco.  The research has four objectives.  The first is to experimentally elevate testosterone (T) in females and measure its effect on the female's phenotype (e.g. appearance, behavior). The second is to determine whether elevated T is adaptive or maladaptive in females.  The third is to assess the potential for correlated responses within and between the sexes by measuring change in T after exposure to a fixed dose of a hormonal stimulant (GnRH). The fourth is to assess sexual independence by comparing the role of T in the activation of aggressive behavior in males and females.   	Research described in this proposal will add to an already impressive 20-year database, provide opportunities for training future scientists of diverse backgrounds in the conduct of cybernetics, and laboratory and field experiments that address the integration of proximate and ultimate explanations for biological differences.  This extensive database will provide fodder for continued synthesis, compilation, and cyber exploitation, and will make a significant contribution to this principle investigator's work, her collaborators, and others who will have access to this gold mine.

The spectrograph incorporates a 76 degree echelle grating with a white pupil design to achieve a spectral resolving power of R=60,000, sufficient to resolve thermal line profiles in solar-type stars, with simultaneous and complete spectral coverage from 390-680 nm, covering the Ca II K and H lines through the Li I feature at 670 nm. The format of the spectrograph will be fixed so that the spectra will be standardized and uniform. All spectra obtained will ultimately be processed through pipeline reductions and made available to the community in a spectral library.     Intellectual Merit: The primary reason to build this spectrograph is the need to conduct large surveys of relatively bright stars, both to obtain statistically significant or complete samples of stellar types and to enable efficient monitoring programs for stellar variability and asteroseismology. The specific scientific goal proposed is a complete survey of the 10,000 Hipparcos stars which are visible from the northern hemisphere and which have high-quality (better than 10%) parallax and proper motion data. These data will be used for studies of stellar properties and evolution, including detailed studies of stellar abundances throughout the HR diagram, studies of the evolution of angular momentum in stars, and studies of the changes of the Li abundance in stars with stellar evolution.     Broader Impacts: The FHiREbot spectrograph will significantly impact the broader community on two fronts: education and research infrastructure. Graduate students and undergraduate astronomy majors at IU will participate in the design and commissioning of the spectrograph; experience with instrumentation is an important component in undergraduate education. Undergraduates will use data from the spectrograph for Senior Honors theses, and graduate students will use FHiREbot for Ph.D. thesis research. More broadly, the archive of standardized spectra will be a resource for small undergraduate research projects carried out as part of our core undergraduate courses. Access to the database will not be restricted to IU, and curricular units on basic spectrum analysis developed for IU courses will be available to educators elsewhere for classroom use.     The impact on research infrastructure in astronomy is potentially large. US astronomers currently have limited access to high dispersion spectrographs, except on the largest telescopes where only limited time is available. Broad spectroscopic surveys are best carried out on moderate aperture telescopes (small telescopes do not collect enough light, and big telescopes cannot access large samples efficiently). The availability of FHiREbot on IU's automated SpectraBot telescope will provide an important piece of instrumentation infrastructure for US astronomers. The FHiREbot database of spectra will also be available to the community for use in scientific investigations.",Catherine Pilachowski|

It seeks to uncover how the cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon senses and responds to changes in light color. This process, called ""complementary chromatic adaptation"" (CCA), involves massive resynthesis of this photosynthetic organism's light harvesting antennae, resulting in a complete color change. This reversible acclimation process allows cells to efficiently use the predominant light wavelength(s) in the environment for photosynthesis. CCA is controlled by two light-responsive pathways that mediate changes in transcription of many genes. The Rca pathway appears to be a complex phosphorelay that controls the expression of red and green light-induced genes and contains three known components, a phytochrome-like photoreceptor and two response regulators. The Cgi pathway controls only green light induced genes. None of the components in this pathway have been isolated. The Rca and Cgi systems may integrate at DNA sequences called ""R Boxes"" through an OmpR-like control mechanism. These studies will answer fundamental questions concerning the mechanism of CCA regulation. They will determine (i) how red light increases pcyA and cpc2 expression levels through deletion and linker scanning analyses, protein binding and footprinting studies, and purification of CCA transcription factors (ii) how the Cgi and Rca systems regulate cpeCDESTR expression through promoter and R Box deletion analysis and (iii) what components make up the Cgi system by transposon mutagenesis and analysis of putative cgi mutants.

Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and its redox cycling exerts a strong influence on the behavior of various organic and inorganic compounds in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  The structure and function of microbial communities associated with Fe redox cycling in near-surface environments is therefore an important topic in environmental microbiology and biogeochemistry.  This project addresses several unique aspects of microbial community structure and physiology related to Fe redox cycling and biomineralization in modern subsoils and shallow groundwater environments.  Such environments are primary receptors of both natural and anthropogenic materials (e.g. run-off from urban and agricultural systems), and microorganisms play a key role in subsurface biogeochemical processes.  The proposed research will explore novel strategies that microbial populations and communities may utilize to derive energy from Fe redox cycling, and will examine the mineralogical signatures of such activities.  Experimental reactive transport systems will be used to mimic natural subsurface environments in which temporal variations in the input of electron donors and acceptors are expected to strongly influence microbial community development and patterns of Fe biomineralization.  The experimental systems will support microbial communities from either a freshwater wetland surface sediment or shallow Atlantic Coastal plain aquifer sediment.  We hypothesize that the energy available from Fe and nitrogen redox interactions will lead to the development of microbial populations and/or communities specifically adapted to take advantage of the energy available during redox oscillations.  In addition, we anticipate that the Fe mineralogy of sediments subject to redox fluctuations will evolve toward a suite of metastable minerals of relative low crystallinity and high reactivity relative to those in sediments under stable redox conditions.  The reactor systems to be developed in this study represent novel research techniques for examining linkages between microbial physiology, community structure, biogeochemical reaction dynamics, and Fe biomineralization.  The geomicrobiological and biogeochemical information gained from these model systems will be incorporated into a microbial energetics-based numerical simulation framework that will allow the results of our experimental studies to be transferred to a variety of surface and subsurface sedimentary environments.  The project will train two Ph.D. students in multidisciplinary biogeochemical research methodologies as well as techniques for numerical simulation of biogeochemical processes and microbial population dynamics in sediments.  An undergraduate intern will participate in microbial culturing and isolation at IU.  The UW Ph.D. student will participate in the training of a summer Research Experience for Teachers (RET) fellow.  The RET fellow will conduct original research, and travel to scientific meetings to present his or her research during the last two years of the project.  The UW Ph.D. student will also participate in the NSF-sponsored Center for Integration of Research, Training, and Learning (CIRTL) program at UW, which offers courses and coordinates internship programs that provide practical experience in bringing science to the broader community.  In addition to these activities, IU will undertake a novel collaboration with the Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology (FAST) aimed at increasing public understanding about the importance of environmental microbiology.  We will work with FAST to develop presentation modules that will be offered by FAST members at selected locations around the U.S.  The general presentations will cover topics of current interest to the public such as the role of bacteria in the metabolism of greenhouse gases, degradation of pollutants, and nutrient cycling (specifically N and Fe) in soils and sediments.",Flynn Picardal|Juergen Schieber

The interdisciplinary research project will investigate (a) how social-ecological and political-economic conditions shape individual belief formation and decision making related to collective action, (b) how importantly and in what ways do network and social-spatial relationships affect individual beliefs and decisions, and (c) what are the aggregate effects of individual interactions and responses on the forests resources on which individuals depend and on local socio-political and institutional structures.  To answer these questions, the investigators will use data from India, Uganda, and Bolivia to build and test statistical and computational models that help analyze the dynamics of human beliefs and actions over time, their interactions, and their influence on environmental outcomes.  The research will build upon a decade-long experience of research in forested environments through the International Forestry Resources and Institutions program and will take steps toward establishing the degree to which environmental variability (from both physical and social-political conditions) and the degree of unpredictability of such variation affect information collected by resource users and the level of reliability humans attach to different sources of information.    By focusing on beliefs, the relevant dimensions along which individuals can be grouped, and the differential involvement of different groups of individuals in collective action to govern forest resources, this project will help fill two critical gaps in existing knowledge about human-environmental dynamics:  (1) the absence of systematic, empirically based research on the features of the context that shape the distribution of beliefs in a population and (2) the lack of attention that has been given to determining how the distribution of beliefs in a population shapes collective action to govern resources.  By focusing on human-environment interactions related to forest resources in specific sites, the project aims to shed new light on questions that are important to theoretical development as well as the design and implementation of public policy.  The ecological and social processes on which the project focuses underpin resource governance outcomes for hundreds of thousands of households all over the world.  The project will permit an examination of interactions between resource governance policies, human livelihoods, changes in human beliefs, and the decision making of agents related to collective action.

In contrast, others may obtain biased or inadequate samples of information.  In situations like this, pooling informational resources among a number of people may help the group as a whole arrive at a better decision.  This proposal outlines two projects examining how individuals can draw upon information that flows through social networks of friends and acquaintances, and use it in making their individual decisions.  The process is dynamic, for as each individual draws on others' input to make decisions, his or her decisions in turn provide additional information to others in the network. Each project considers the relationships of variables at several levels, from individual agents' decision strategies (e.g., how much weight to give socially provided versus individually obtained information), to inter-agent interactions in which agents exchange information, to the overall structures of social networks.  The first project considers multiple agents who are sharing information and influencing each others' choices on a particular decision (such as the choice of consumer products, or the preference for a particular social policy).  The second project considers multiple agents who are assessing each other as potential partners or mates, and examines how these decisions are influenced by the spread of information about the agents themselves through the social network.  Both projects will use multi-agent simulation techniques and empirical studies with human participants.  The projects will have several types of broader impacts.  They will increase interdisciplinary interchange, by applying novel multi-agent simulation techniques in combination with social psychological theories and empirical findings, to deepen our understanding of the role of information flow through social networks in the decision-making process.  The first project may help develop ways for people to more efficiently draw on the information and experiences of others as they make their own individual decisions (e.g., purchasing consumer products) and thereby improve the outcomes of those decisions.  Finally, the second project may ultimately help enhance understanding of how people select others as partners or mates, and perhaps improve the quality of those decisions - with a potential impact on the high divorce rate in society and on the multiple social problems to which it contributes.",Eliot Smith|Robert Goldstone|Luis Rocha

The formal principles underlying these systems are applicable across a wide range of domains.  Although the broad applicability of these principles speaks to their importance, it also represents a challenge to educators to convey these principles in a way that students can appreciate the principle at a sufficiently abstract level that the student can transfer the principle across superficially unrelated domains.  The current research addresses the question of when and how do have students transfer what they have learned about scientific principles to new situations. Our proposed research explores methods for teaching students about scientific principles in a manner that leads to grounded yet transportable knowledge. A central inquiry of this proposal concerns the relation between the superficial, concrete details through which a phenomenon is presented, and the abstraction of deeper scientific principles underlying the phenomenon.    Our experiments explore the role of perceptually-based simulations in fostering students' scientific understanding.  By observing how active exploration of one simulation benefits understanding of a subsequently presented simulation based on the same principle, we can assess whether the scientific principle has been successfully abstracted.  Experiments will explore the roles of graphical concreteness, narrative contextualization, language specificity, and diagrams on students' implicit and explicit knowledge of scientific principles.  One research outcome will be prescriptions for how and when concrete and highly contextualized materials should be used, compared to idealized and decontextualized materials.  One line of research focuses on the language that accompanies interactive computer simulations by manipulating the concreteness and abstractness of words. These experiments explore how best to use words to foster transferable knowledge: by gradually introducing increasingly abstract language, by combining abstract language with concrete visuals (or vice versa), or by using concrete but metaphorically related words.    A second line of experiments aims to give participants first-person experiences with scientific principles to test whether they promote spontaneous transfer across analogous situations.  Using the scientific principle of Signal Detection Theory, we will compare direct experience with a signal detection task with explicit instruction. Further experiments will determine if the advantages of experience vs. instruction are modulated by the perceptual concreteness of the simulations, and the narrative richness of the training scenario.    The scientific goal of the inquiry is to gain an understanding of how perceptual experience can lead to abstract conceptual understanding, and how conceptual understanding can change perceptual experience.  The practical goal is to translate this understanding into general educational principles for integrating computer simulations into classroom activities.",Robert Goldstone|Linda Smith

Reproductive isolation barriers are a substantial obstacle to agricultural exploitation of wild germplasm and are fundamental to the origin of biodiversity. Nonetheless, very little is known about the genes responsible for reproductive isolation, especially among plant species.

Much of this data originates from on-line sensors that act as streaming data sources, providing a continuous flow of information. As sensor sources proliferate, the flow of data becomes a deluge, and the extraction and delivery of important features in a timely and comprehensible manner becomes an ever increasingly difficult problem. More specifically, developing data mining and assimilation tools for data deluged applications faces three fundamental challenges. The amount of distributed real time streaming data is so large that even current extreme scale computing cannot effectively process it. Second, today's broadly deployable network protocols and web services do not provide the low latency and high bandwidth required by high volume real time data streams and distributed computing resources connected  over networks with high bandwidth delay products. Finally, the vast majority of today's statistical and data mining algorithms assume that all the data is co-located and at rest in files. Here, the real time data streams are distributed and the applications that consume them must be optimized to process multiple high volume real time streams. The goal is to develop novel algorithms and hardware acceleration schemes to allow real-time statistical modeling and change detection on such large-scale streaming data sets.  By using Service Oriented Architecture principles, a framework for integrating high -performance change detection software services, including accelerations of commonly used kernels in statistical modeling, into a Grid messaging substrate will be developed and tested. Geographical Information System (GIS) services will be supported using  Open Geospatial Consortium standards to enable geo-referencing.     This project has the potential to have near-term and long-term impact in several important areas. In the near-term, the implementation of kernels and modules of statistical modeling and change detection algorithms will allow the end-user applications (e.g., homeland security, defense) to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance for data driven decision support. In the longer term, the availability of toolkits and kernels for the change detection and data mining algorithms will facilitate the development of applications in many areas including defense, security, science and others. Furthermore, this research will bring the use of reconfigurable  architectural acceleration of functions on streaming data including change detection and data mining, thereby opening new avenues of research and enabling newer data-driven applications on complex datasets. Both graduate and undergraduate students (through undergraduate fellowships) are engaged  in the research.

Although built-in general-purpose optimizations might be generally beneficial, they cannot be directly applied to user-defined types because their correctness cannot be determined a priori. Extending a compiler to optimize some particular userdefined type would be useful for that particular type, but this approach becomes burdensome if the compiler must be extended on a type-by-type basis. A more powerful approach would be to enable compiler optimizations that are generic, i.e., that can be applied to any type (built-in or user-defined) that meets fundamental semantic requirements.    Intellectual Merit    -Formal concept definitions. The PIs propose to integrate concept-based optimization with their research on         formalization of concepts for generic programming.  -Language support for concepts. Concept-based optimization will leverage and inform our on-going research    on direct language support for concepts and generic programming.  -Compiler support for concepts.

An important benchmark in this regard will be to demonstrate that     generic optimizations offer the same performance benefits when applied to built-in types as do traditional     type-specific optimizations.    Broader Impact  The proposed research will have:  - Direct impact on the future development of mainstream programming languages that support generic    programming (e.g., C++, C#, and Java), and on their standard libraries.   -Support for  generic programming in these languages that will provide valuable high-level information about   user-defined types,making high-level and concept-based optimization more widely applicable.     This project will directly train graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in the emerging field of   generic programming.

""Divide-and-conquer"" applies at once to recursive control, to data  sharing, to broad communication, and to machine organization. Programmers will again be able to solve important problems without much knowledge about the memory hierarchy or network communication.

In order to take full advantage of the data being produced by various genome sequencing projects, this project aims to extend the statistical and computational tools necessary for biological researchers to study gene families. There are three main goals of this proposal: 1) Development of improved statistical tools. This work will enable more refined estimates of gene duplication and deletion parameters between species, and will provide new ways in which to study gene families within single genomes. The inclusion of methods for detecting and incorporating whole genome duplications will greatly extend statistical inferences. 2) Creation of easy-to-use software. A free software package will be implemented that can be used by researchers studying whole genomes or individual gene families. Statistical tools created in this project will be quickly disseminated to the community via this package. 3) Providing annotated gene families for Drosophila. The sequencing of 12 Drosophila species will be a boon to comparative genomics studies. By working with FlyBase to provide a well-annotated set of gene families from across these species, we will present new ways for biologists to connect this information with functional and comparative genomic data. The products of this research will provide a broad statistical and computational framework for all future studies of gene families. The research will also provide a diverse training environment for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in molecular evolution, statistics, and bioinformatics. The participation of under-represented groups and women via multiple scholarship programs will ensure that this specific research priority is achieved.

Consequently, many animals display seasonal changes in physiology and behavior which allow them to cope with seasonal changes.  Day length is the main environmental cue used by animals to coordinate seasonal behavioral and physiological responses. For example, animals living in long ""summer-like"" day lengths will maintain high levels of the hormone testosterone and thus will continue to breed, whereas animals housed on short ""winter-like"" days will inhibit their breeding due to low testosterone.  In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that rodents housed in short days display increased aggression compared with animals housed on long days, despite lower levels of testosterone.  This finding is particularly interesting given the traditional belief that testosterone regulates aggression.   This project is designed to investigate the hormonal mechanisms regulating seasonal changes in aggression in rodents. Specifically, animals will be housed in long or short days in the lab and levels of specific hormones, including testosterone and the adrenal hormone cortisol, will be experimentally manipulated.  Aggression will then be videotaped and quantified using a computer-based video analysis system.  Based on previous research, it is predicted that the adrenal hormone cortisol, rather than testosterone, regulates seasonal aggression. These experiments challenge the simple notion that all forms of aggression are testosterone-dependent and have important implications for the study of how hormones act on the brain to regulate social behaviors and how these behaviors may be altered by the environment.  Collectively, these studies will help identify important and novel mechanisms of hormonal control of aggression.  Importantly, these studies will provide excellent opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, including under-represented minorities, to gain hands-on experience and to allow them to develop important scientific skills by conducting, presenting and publishing scientific research.",Gregory Demas|

They are involved in a vast array of responses to hormonal, nutritional, developmental, and environmental stimuli. The overall goal of the work proposed is to elucidate the roles played by selected protein kinases in the development of young seedlings. Two protein kinases from Arabidopsis named WAG1 and WAG2 are the focus of this proposal. Mutations in both WAG1 and WAG2 abolish the expression of these genes. Nevertheless, the wag1 and wag2 single mutants exhibit no detectable affect on the plant. However, when the wag single mutants are genetically crossed to generate wag1/wag2 double mutants, they do show a readily observable difference compared to their non-mutant counterparts. Seedlings of the double mutants exhibit a pronounced root growth defect when grown on vertically-oriented Petri plates: the roots possess a wavy pattern. Root waving of this type is observed in normal seedlings only when the Petri plates are leaned backward from vertical (inclined at pitches less than 90). It is proposed that WAG1 and WAG2 are negative regulators of root waving in Arabidopsis.     To elucidate the roles that WAG1 and WAG2 play in root growth, the specific aims of the proposed research are:     (1) To ask whether altering the amount or enzymatic activity of WAG1 and WAG2 affects the root waving response in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings.     (2) To explore the underlying mechanisms for the wavy root phenotype in wag1/wag2 mutants, particularly with regard to the effect of gravity on root growth and the transport of and response to the plant growth hormone auxin.      Broader Impacts:  This project will provide training opportunities for an undergraduate student, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral associate. The two WAG genes under study encode protein kinases that when mutated confer an unusual growth pattern on seedling roots. Understanding the role of the WAG kinases will provide fundamental insight into the cellular pathways regulating root development that have not yet been defined. Root waving can be viewed as an adaptive response that may enhance the ability of a root to navigate its way around impenetrable objects encountered in the soil. As such, understanding the process of root waving and the genes that regulate it might contribute to other research areas, such as ecological physiology. Moreover, manipulating root waving genetically might improve a young seedlings ability to become established in the field, and thus provide agricultural benefits as well.",John Watson|

Words provide labels for the objects and events that fill the world of the language learner, and their importance in development is underscored by the fact that, as early as two years of age, children acquire the vocabulary of their native language quickly and with no apparent effort.  If one considers only the child's linguistic enviroment (i.e., the utterances that are heard), then word learning appears to be a very difficult task because there is so little information to discern the sounds and meanings that are associated with each word.  But the linguistic environment is embedded in the larger context of the child's physical and social interactions with the world, and this larger context provides crucial information for the process of word learning.    With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Yu and Dr. Smith will investigate the mechanisms by which word learning is grounded in sensorimotor experiences, and in real-time, multimodal interactions between children and their caregivers. Using both empirical and computational methods, the investigators will identify the physical and social cues that are available to language learners, and they will examine how those cues serve to guide the attention of the langauge learner towards aspects of the environment that are relevant to word learning.

Detailed chromatographic analyses are able to identify up to 80% of the constituent molecules in POM from surface waters, but less than 20% of POM from particles after they have fallen into abyssal waters and sediments. Different analytical methods have also thus far produced disparate, and sometimes incompatible, results concerning factors affecting preservation or compositional changes during sinking. The composition of DOM is better constrained, but the primarily NMR-based studies have not been tested by independent methods. In this project, researchers from California Institute of Technology and from University of Illinois will apply existing methods for hydrogen-isotopic analysis to the study of marine POM and DOM in order to help constrain the biochemical composition of these materials. Hydrogen-isotopic analyses will place three new kinds of constraints on the molecular composition of these materials. The elemental ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) in demineralized organic materials and selected biochemical fractions should allow distinction of fresh biomolecules (H/C > 1.5) versus kerogen derived from sediments and black carbon (H/C < 1.0). Second, the fraction of organic H that is susceptible to rapid isotopic exchange in water represents primarily O- and N-bound H, and is much higher in amino acids and carbohydrates (30-50%) than in lipids and hydrocarbons (<5%). Third, the isotopic composition of non-exchangeable H ( 8 Dn) in biomolecules differs substantially between lipids (typically  Dn < -150% ), petroleum hydrocarbons (~-100%), and amino acids and carbohydrates (typically > -50%). The hydrogen data will be complemented by a suite of ancillary analyses such as GCMS, pyrolysis-GCMS, SEM, and quantification of organic sulfur. Samples will be examined from a variety of locations such as the San Pedro Basin (coastal CA), Station M (eastern abyssal Pacific), and other locations around the world. Samples will be acquired during a 5-day research cruise, as well as via collaborations and piggy-backing on other cruises. This research will measure, for the first time, D/H fractionations between biochemical classes in both marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria, and will examine fractionations accompanying the degradation of algal biomass, both potentially useful for carbon-cycle studies. The PIs will explore the use of exchangeability profiles (i.e., the fraction of exchangeable H as a function of time or temperature) to characterize the compactness and cross-linking of tertiary structure in organic macromolecules, a property that should also be useful to biochemists or polymer chemists.    Among the broader impacts is the transfer of H-isotopic analytical methods to marine applications.  The researchers will also develop more automated and sensitive methods for measuring Dn using elemental analyzer technology, an achievement that will have important benefits for constructing high-resolution paleoclimate records based on organic D/H.

The effort builds on the research summarized in several NRC expert panels and the ideas which have been emerging in interdisciplinary efforts to develop a broader understanding the impact of educational testing on teaching and learning. The project will start with a multi-level model of formative assessment that emerged in two prior NSF funded studies. In an unprecedented collaboration, this approach will be refined and validated by a team of experts representing mathematics education, mathematical sciences, linguistics, educational testing, and educational assessment. The project advisory panel consists of international leaders in each area, including individuals who are also spearheading interdisciplinary advance across these areas.    Broader Impact  Broad impact is expected because the approach meets the demand of the NCLB act for immediate and continual gains on criterion-referenced tests for all students, without undercutting other educational goals. In addition to directly advancing elementary mathematics instruction, the project offers a scalable, worthwhile alternative to the ubiquitous ""test-prep"" interventions that often do more harm than good. The project will broaden classroom assessment to directly advance students' discourse, fluency, and understanding, and guide teachers' remediation and curricular refinement. As such the project will forge new insights for using classroom discourse and formative feedback for accomplishing these broad goals which oftentimes are treated as if they are in conflict.  The approach features two levels of classroom assessments (semi-formal and formal) and an innovative ""conversational"" approach to formative feedback. Existing (commercial and public domain) assessments will be used to create 26 open-ended quizzes and 2 multiple-choice exams.  The quizzes are aligned to existing curriculum, completed after appropriate regular lessons, and are ungraded. The exams consist of items that are aligned with the subdomains of the pertinent criterion referenced test, are completed at the end of the semester, and are formally graded. .Learner oriented formative feedback rubrics will be developed for both. The rubrics offer detailed, technically accurate explanations of the problems, without directly stating the ""correct"" answer. Students use their completed assessments and the rubrics to discuss their collective understanding of the assessed topics. Simple video-based coaches guide them toward worthwhile feedback conversations; materials and guidelines will help teachers (1) align assessments to their existing curriculum, (2) use initial performance and mathematical discourse to improve that curriculum, and (3) provide informal and formal remediation.  The study will focus on fifth-grade mathematics, and take place in two Georgia elementary schools that serve a high proportion of ethnic and linguistic minorities. Across three year-long implementations, success is ensured by using design-based and linguistic methods to directly enhance students' mathematical discourse and teachers use of formative feedback , while indirectly maximizing students' performance on four outcome measures (an innovative discourse-based assessment, CTB's open-ended Balanced Assessment in Mathematic, Georgia's Criterion-Referenced Content Test, and the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills).  The schools will be randomly assigned to implementation or comparison conditions. The first year will consist of piloting and iterative refinements with just one implementation teacher. During the second year, the three or four fifth grade teachers participating at the implementation school will be assigned to different conditions to test the individual and collective impact of the quizzes and exams. Gains on the outcome measures will be compared to similar fifth-grade classrooms at the comparison school.

A major question in nuclear   physics is how this quark substructure is manifested in observables in   nuclear physics. To reveal these quark effects, we concentrate on approximate   symmetries. These are symmetries of nature that are nearly, but not completely,  obeyed. Studying how these symmetries are violated, and by how much, allows us   to examine quark effects in nuclear physics. We focus particularly on charge   symmetry; this would be an exact symmetry if there were no differences between   protons and neutrons. We concentrate on effects of breaking charge   symmetry at high energies, where the quark structure of matter is more evident.  We also propose to study details of the strong interaction, the interaction   that holds the atomic nucleus together. We are currently concentrating on   ""exclusive"" reactions (scattering reactions where all of the final products   are observed). We are trying to determine the most efficient of two equivalent   ways of describing these reactions. Another area of proposed study is an   examination of effects that occur when particles move in extremely small   two-dimensional systems. It has long been known that particles like atoms and   molecules possess both particle and wave properties. In most cases the ""wave""   properties of matter are small, subtle effects. In certain systems, the wave   effects can dominate observed properties. These effects are seen in ""nanoscale""  systems (with dimensions roughly those between atoms in a solid) with visible   light, or by using microwaves in systems with dimensions in centimeters. We   carry out numerical simulations in collaboration with a physicist who conducts   experiments on microwave systems.     The broader impacts involve training of scientists in high-tech fields.

Generic extensions of the standard model of subatomic particles predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS), which are excellent candidates for the dark matter. These are expected to interact very weakly with ordinary matter, and thus be extremely difficult to detect.      The PICASSO group has undertaken the development of a new large dark matter detector derived from the well-known bubble chamber technique. In this application, the detector consists of a uniform emulsion of micron-sized halocarbon droplets suspended in a compliant material such as a polymeric or aqueous gel and kept in a superheated state (i.e., above their boiling point.) In this meta-stable state, the droplets can be vaporized by a nucleus recoiling from a collision with a WIMP. Sound emitted during this rapid phase transition can be recorded using acoustic sensors. The maturity of the technique, along with the ability to increase the target size at relatively low cost and the possibility of tailoring the response to specific types of radiation, have brought superheated emulsions to the forefront of dark matter investigations. PICASSO will be among the world's most sensitive detectors in the investigation of spin-dependent interactions between dark matter and WIMPs.      The PI on this proposal at Indiana University, South Bend is responsible for sound sensors and their associated electronics, and for measuring acoustic properties of the detectors for PICASSO. The PI will also be responsible for measuring radon emanation from, and diffusion through, detector materials. The radioassay facility will also be available for use in other low background experiments.  PICASSO will be sited at SNOLAB.    Broader impacts:  Enhancing the education of science majors and education majors is an integral part of this program. Three physics majors have participated in the work at Indiana University SB.

Education majors and local teachers will have inquiry-based science experiences and will produce written technical reports that they will defend orally at a collaboration meeting. Having participated in a real science project will inform the teaching of science when they are in the classroom. One secondary science education major is currently working with the PI and has produced 75 of the required 300 transducers for the 2 kg experiment and has helped to develop a rapid-cycling environment chamber for transducer testing.",Ilan Levine|

For instance, delicate information about geodesics and geometry at different scales in these spaces can be gleaned from the behavior of random walks on discrete models and the study of certain ergodic measures on their geometric boundaries. For random walks on nonamenable groups, a basic question has been to understand the relationship of its Poisson boundary to other natural geometric boundaries. Starting with the work of Furstenberg, and continuing with the work of many others, much progress has been made in understanding when Poisson boundary measures for a random walks on important classes of nonpositively curved groups can be supported on their geodesic boundary. However, much less is known about what measures can arise this way. The first part of the proposed research seeks to show that many of the classes of ergodic measures arising from geometric constructions on the ideal boundary are represented by Poisson boundaries. We are also interested in groups which are not nonpositively curved, yet share some common features such as the mapping class groups or the diffeomorphism group of a circle. This represents a natural outgrowth of the PI's work with R. Muchnik. The second proposed direction of study examines the barycenter method as a tool for understanding manifolds admitting nontrivial maps to nonpositively curved manifolds. This is a differential geometric application of the study of boundary measures. By relating the volume and large scale geometry of a manifold, we wish to use these methods to realize further extensions of Mostow rigidity.         A number of remarkable developments in both mathematics and the physical sciences have revealed how random processes in a given system often reflect certain structural features of that system. For example, an ant randomly stepping one unit north, south, east or west in the Euclidean plane will eventually return to its starting point with probabilistic certainty. However, this no longer holds when one allows an additional degree of freedom of movement, say up and down in the third dimension. Hence, the recurrence property of this ""random walk"" detects the dimension of the ambient space. We propose to study the flexibility of such connections between the geometry of the underlying space and certain random processes. We especially are interested in understanding when generalized random walks on important families of spaces can produce a prescribed set of measurements. From another point of view, these auxiliary measurements themselves capture other intrinsic aspects of these spaces, and can sometimes indicate ""rigidity"" of the space. This refers to the phenomenon whereby a weak equivalence between spaces implies a strong equivalence. We hope to discover new ways in which rigidity arises.",Christopher Connell|

Country rock contamination has been proposed as a requirement to produce sulfide saturation in mantle-derived basaltic magmas, either through assimilation of crustal sulfur, or by assimilation of siliceous material that results in a decrease in the sulfide solubility of the mafic magma. The Re-Os isotopic system has proven particularly useful in evaluating the role of crustal contamination in magmatic ore deposits and in mantle-derived rocks in general. Because of the chalcophile nature of both Re and Os, the system is well-suited as an indicator of crustally derived metals in sulfide mineralization. However, recent studies have shown that the Re-Os isotopic system may be particularly prone to perturbations related to later interaction with fluids.   Previous S isotopic studies of likely country rock contaminants suggest that these rocks were the principal source of sulfur for the magmatic sulfide mineralization associated with the Duluth complex.  However, preliminary Re-Os isotopic studies indicate that sulfide minerals in the contact aureole are characterized by unradiogenic Os whereas the massive sulfide mineralization at Duluth is characterized by radiogenic Os - indicative of extensive Os contamination. Extreme Re-Os isotopic variations in the sulfide systems in these rocks are reflective of fundamental processes that must accompany the interaction of mafic magmas with crustal rocks. Veins in the contact aureole contain quartz and a sulfide assemblage (pyrrhotitecubainte-pentlandite) that is very similar to that found in the magmatic sulfide mineralization. In order to test the premise that the perturbation of the Re/Os isotopic system in the contact aureole is related to the reaction between Re-Os-bearing fluids and sulfide minerals, fluid inclusion, stable isotopic, and Re-Os isotopic studies of the vein material, as well as spatially associated sedimentary sulfides, are planned. These data will allow assessment of the origin and composition of the fluid, and its relationship to the magmas of the Duluth Complex. Because large xenoliths of country rocks that preserve low-grade mineral assemblages in their cores are present in the intrusive rocks of the Complex, we will also be able to systematically evaluate the mechanisms responsible for Re-Os and S isotopic variations from xenolith cores through metamorphosed margins and surrounding disseminated sulfide-bearing igneous rocks. The results of this study will shed light on the causes of Re-Os isotopic variations in sulfide systems related to mafic magma-crust interaction, and will be of particular value in the evaluation of Re-Os isotopic systematics associated with magmatic sulfide ore formation.    Broader Impacts: Broader aspects of the proposed research include the training of both graduate and undergraduate students in systematic field sampling and in the use of state-of-theart analytical facilities for chemical and isotopic analyses at three NSF-funded laboratories. Cooperation with the Minnesota Natural Resources Research Institute will be essential for the project to succeed. Exploration for, and utilization of, metallic resources found in magmatic systems continues to grow as third-world economies strengthen. Knowledge of how an often utilized radiogenic isotopic system may respond to high-temperature events involving magmas and fluids is essential to the development of future exploration models.",Edward Ripley|

In this project, Dr. Sara Friedman will study the impact of these marriages on the legal and cultural notions of citizenship and national identity in Taiwan.  She will examine debates about Taiwan's immigration and citizenship, shifts in formal definitions of citizenship, the role of cross-Strait marriages in changing those definitions, and how cross-Strait couples experience the effects of contentious official ties in their intimate relationships. She will use a variety of methodologies, including interviews, policy analysis, focus groups, web-based ethnography, and participant observation to investigate the formulation of citizenship standards and national identity in the encounters between marital immigrants, officials, social service providers, and Taiwanese citizens.    This ethnographic study of everyday citizenship practices will offer insights into what citizenship means to groups who have been socialized in different political contexts but who otherwise share cultural and ethnic similarities. The project will contribute to new theoretical developments in anthropology and legal studies concerning changing citizenship models in relation to transnational migration and regional forms of governance. The outcomes of this research will be of interest to policy makers, officials, and NGOs who seek to balance concerns about state sovereignty and democratic institutions with new immigration pressures.  The research also may aid efforts to develop avenues for diminishing tensions across the Taiwan Strait",Sara Friedman|

This disturbing trend prompts challenging questions about disease, such as, why do some populations become infected and not others?  Recently, ecologists have suspected that other species, such as those that provide food for hosts, compete with hosts for food, and prey on sick hosts, can inhibit or facilitate disease spread.  Therefore, interactions with other species may influence the distribution of wildlife disease.  However, an exploration of this possibility requires an  integration of epidemiology with community ecology.  Few disease systems offer opportunities for such integration, but Hall and Caceres aim to exploit an experimentally tractable one using an aquatic parasite (fungus)-host (water flea, Daphnia) system.  They will harness decades of study of Daphnia as grazers of algae, as competitors with other zooplankton for that algae, and as prey for fishes and invertebrates.  Each of these interactions likely influences disease spread among the Daphnia hosts.  For instance, quantity and quality of food resources influence the production of infective forms of the parasite.  However, because they consume but do not produce these infective forms, other planktonic competitors may reduce disease.  Finally, predators may inhibit disease by eating infected hosts.  These mechanisms are complex and will thus be addressed by constructing mathematical models, refining those models using experiments, and testing model predictions with observations of epidemics.          The processes examined in this study and the modeling work should apply to many other disease systems.  Ultimately, this work will produce theories that can guide efforts to understand and control disease in wildlife populations.",Spencer Hall|

In the hierarchy of biological organization, which ranges from cells and gametes to populations and species, selection can and does operate simultaneously at more than one level and in more than one direction.

The proposed work will synthesize more than thirty years of theoretical, experimental and field research conducted with students on levels of selection.  The book will focus especially on genetic interactions and the effectiveness of different kinds of selection.

Phylogenetic relationships amongst species will be clarified, thus advancing knowledge of fungal systematics.  Relationships between plant and AM fungal diversity will be tested at several spatial scales, which in turn will provide better estimates of how much biodiversity is missing across ecosystem types. Sampling design includes comparisons of disturbed and undisturbed sites, so estimates of the number of species that might be at risk from habitat degradation can be obtained.

The conventional wisdom is that in a parliamentary system, a majority party or coalition that controls which proposals are considered, what amendments are allowed, and how voting proceeds can secure whichever outcomes it wants.  However, while agenda power is important, it is not decisive.  There are well-known cases where parties or coalitions appear to control their chamber, but could not secure their desired outcomes.  These examples suggest there are fundamental limits on what a majority party or coalition can achieve.  What are these limits, and why do they arise?    The researchers start from the assumption that legislative institutions shape outcomes, but focus on a more fundamental constraint: the limits on legislative action created by party preferences.  The premise of this research is that the potential for agenda power is shaped by the party system - the number, size, and ideological distribution of parties in the legislature, including the preferences of minority parties.       The analysis aims at understanding the relationship between preferences, rules, and outcomes.  For example, if agenda control conveys an advantage, changes in who holds this power alters outcomes, even if preferences stay the same.  If agenda control is irrelevant, then changes in agenda power have little or no effect on legislative outcomes.  Outcomes instead are sensitive to changes in party preferences.  Thus, attempts to explain legislative outcomes must distinguish between the impact of institutions and the role of variation in parties and coalitions.     The intellectual merit of this research stems from a tight linkage of theory, hypothesis tests, and real-world data.  Building on the researchers' previous work (SES-0241778), they propose a unified analytic approach, focusing on the one thing shared by all legislatures: majority rule.  The point is not that the U.S. House is the same as the British Parliament or the Russian Duma.  Rather, the researchers aim at understanding why these legislatures operate so differently, why parties and coalitions are seemingly powerful in some legislatures but not others, and why party or coalition influence in some countries varies over time.      The broader impact of this work lies in its focus on fundamental questions of democracy and majority rule.  When one observes democracy in action, whether as scholars or as citizens, the conclusions about the fairness of the process as well as the evaluations of why things happened as they did are based on assumptions about the role of parties, institutions, and strategies in creating these outcomes.  The goal in this project is to develop a better set of expectations and insights to guide both scholars and citizens in their roles as observers and as participants in the democratic process.",William Bianco|Regina Smyth

Throughout Earth history, these fine-grained sediments have preserved a record of ancient surface conditions and climates, as well as of organic activity in the form of biomarkers and fossils. In spite of their significance, however, our understanding of the depositional processes of mudstones is still rudimentary. In a newly built flume the PI's have conducted a series of initial experiments and can demonstrate that, contrary to conventional wisdom, mud deposition from swift currents (10-30 cm/sec) should be a common phenomenon in a wide range of sedimentary environments. Flocculation of clays leads to bedload transport of clay floccules, formation of low relief migrating ripples, and to buildup of mud layers. The aligned magnetic fabrics of ancient mudstones suggest that this process was active for many mudstones in the rock record as well. Proposed modifications to the existing flume facility will allow the PI's to more efficiently pursue the measurement of physical parameters that control mud deposition, and record the small scale sedimentary features that result from different combinations of parameters (e.g. salinity, clay type, flow velocity). These data will provide the baseline for understanding the physical conditions of mud deposition, and will be the first step in an effort to integrate physical, chemical, and biological parameters of mud deposition.",Juergen Schieber|John Southard

This is a missed opportunity because the states legislatures display variation in many of the key factors that legislative theories predict should influence the operations of these bodies and how responsive they are to their electorates.   The greatest obstacle to this comparative analysis has been a simple lack of data.   Roll call records are frequently used to measure legislators' policy positions as well as the cohesion and strength of legislative parties within legislatures.   But, unlike Congress, the records of roll call votes in the states have not been in any easily available format for scientific analyses. This data shortage is addressed with the development of a methodology of computer-assisted extraction of roll call data from the variety of sources and formats in which this information is found in the states. This approach to data generation is dramatically more efficient and less error-prone than traditional methods of hand coding and manual data entry. The methodology has been well-developed so that a complete set of competitive roll calls and matching presidential vote totals for legislative districts were compiled for the 1999-2000 sessions, and subsequently, for the post-redistricting legislative sessions of 2003-2004.   In addition the investigator has collected all of the state legislative roll call votes available from state legislative web sites. This includes roll calls for 74 of the chambers covering periods from six to 22 years.  The longitudinal data are particularly important for assessing the effects of changes in party control, the character of the larger party systems which has been polarizing, and changes in legislative rules and procedures.    The data from 1999-2000 have been fully processed are and available for general use. This grant supports the processing of the remaining data sets, including extraction of the key information and the formatting the data so that it is suitable for statistical analyses and distribution to the research community.     The availability of this new data resource will provide the raw materials for testing existing legislative theory on a much larger set of cases and for developing new research questions that derive from a comparative perspective. The data sets will facilitate researchers' efforts to develop new knowledge about the workings of America's legislatures.  Beyond the basic research value of these data, the project has the potential for broader impacts by informing public understanding of the operations of the full set of American legislatures including the impacts of reforms such as term limits, electoral change, divided government, and redistricting as well as the effects of electoral change such as party control of the legislatures and governorships.",Gerald Wright|

However, it remains necessary to use downscaling tools to describe climate on spatial scales suitable for impact analyses. Changes in near-surface wind speeds have long been acknowledged as having particular importance for climate change impacts on society via their impact on, for example, thermal comfort, structural design, feasibility of harnessing renewable energy resources, agriculture and forestry and soil erosion. However, tools have not yet been fully developed or evaluated which can be used to derive climatologies of near-surface wind speeds for historical, current or future conditions at the spatial scales necessary for application in impact analyses. This project will develop and apply physical (dynamical) and statistical (empirical) downscaling tools to AOGCM output to provide an assessment of the accuracy of various tools for downscaling wind climates, to generate projections of probability distributions of wind speeds for the contiguous USA and surrounding coastal waters, and to quantify uncertainties in those projections.

It brings the excitement of discovery into the classroom by getting students to actually do science, not just learn about it from lectures and activities far removed from the actual research process. Students participate in an authentic research project by completing observations on a research-class telescope, analyzing the data and interpreting their results. They collect and interpret information in response to their guided personal exploring and work together as collaborators in a cooperative rather than competitive environment.      RBSE is a natural integration of research and education because it teaches science as it is done. It incorporates several ""best practice"" teaching strategies which model scientific reasoning. These include focusing on an in-depth project, engaging in out-of class activities, using computers as a tool for data display and analysis, using student logs and concept maps for assessment, and using the Internet. This project is determining the most effective way to implement RBSE curricula in undergraduate classrooms. It is also assessing the student gains from participation.    The broader impacts of the activity  For many students, an introductory astronomy course represents their last formal exposure to science. RBSE gives students an opportunity to experience the rewards of research early enough to pursue science as a career. Even if students do not pursue STEM degrees, RBSE develops critical-thinking and teamwork skills that are necessary in any career, and it helps a large number of students understand the scientific process.     About 5,100 students at the University of Alaska Anchorage, Kenai Peninsula College, and Indiana University are participating in the project . The curriculum is being developed to be ""off the shelf,"" such that other undergraduate instructors may use it. Workshops for about thirty instructors per year are held at the national AAPT and AAS meetings to introduce the RBSE pedagogy and developed curriculum, and to develop a national network of educators participating in RBSE.      Flexible teaching modes such as RBSE engage the broad range of diverse, culturally derived orientations to learning. They are effective in allowing women and minorities, groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science, to find their voice and develop confidence in their ability to do science.",Catherine Pilachowski|

Students involved in undergraduate research are more likely to complete their undergraduate education and go on to graduate school than students who did not have a research experience; they also self-report intellectual gains.  This project is taking the assessment of student learning in undergraduate research to the next level by documenting the intellectual gains experienced by students as a result of participating in mentored research, and by exploring the relative importance of the mentoring relationship and its effect on student intellectual gain. Exactly which components and to what extent do these different components of the research environment bring about intellectual growth--is it the process of answering a unique question or the mentoring that students receive as they undertake their projects?    Using an electronic portfolio tool, ePortfolio, from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), the project is collecting data from students and faculty members at 19 different campuses.  Project members are examining student intellectual skills before and after the research experience in three key principles of undergraduate learning: core communication and quantitative skills, critical thinking, and integration and the application of knowledge. Students construct an electronic learning portfolio to document evidence from undergraduate research, connect their evidence to the selected principles, and collaborate with faculty mentors to assess and understand their own intellectual growth as a result of participation in research. Students also complete on-line questionnaires about the mentoring environment, and demographic information. The final result of this project will be the creation of an assessment platform to document student learning as a result of a mentored undergraduate research program that will be widely available to the academic community across the nation.",Kathryn Wilson|Mary Crowe|Sharon Hamilton|Anthony Stamatoplos

Dobbs, R. Westfall, K. Figala, and others. Although Newton wrote about a million words on the subject, only a tiny fraction of this had been examined seriously and even less had been edited before the first phase of the current NSFfunded project (2003-2006). In the second phase (2006-2009), the remainder of Newton's chymical papers will be edited, and a systematic attempt will be made to determine the chronology of the manuscripts and to examine their sources in an exhaustive and critical manner. Previous historians have been unreliable in determining such basic issues as which of the manuscripts are actually Newtonian compositions as opposed to being mere transcriptions or patchwork mosaics of other authors' words. Because of these and other problems, historians are only now beginning to determine what Newton's ultimate goals for his chymistry were, despite previous strong claims that he found his concept of attractive forces there or that he saw his chymistry as part of a quest to discover the vitalistic principles that underlie the cosmos. The intellectual merit of the project will lie in rectifying these problems. The PI, William R. Newman, is researching Newton's chymistry with the goal of composing a new book on the subject, while at the same time overseeing a project to digitize Newton's chymical papers for an online edition (under the general direction of The Newton Project (www.newtonproject.ic.ac.uk) at Imperial College London). In order to facilitate our understanding of Newton's chymistry, Newman will continue to carry out research on Newton's laboratory notebooks and manuscripts with the help of Cathrine Reck of the Indiana University Chemistry Department (a number of Newton's experiments have already been replicated by Newman for the recent NOVA documentary, ""Newton's Dark Secrets"" and for the earlier BBC production, ""Newton: the Dark Heretic""). The second phase of the project for editing the chymical papers will be carried out at Indiana University under Newman's direction, with the aid of John Walsh, Associate Librarian (Digital Library Program) at Indiana University. Lawrence M. Principe of Johns Hopkins University will also collaborate on the project, as a consultant in the editing, deciphering, and annotating of Newton's manuscripts. The broader impacts of this project will be multiple. First, Newman's new study will not consider Newton's interests in alchemy merely as ancillary to his physics but will place them within the history of chemistry broadly construed, which will give a new and undistorted picture of the subject. The interest of NOVA and BBC in this project shows that the public will also be eager for the results of this research. The electronic edition will vastly aid Newman and other scholars in studying the development of Newton's chymical project, since the word-searchability of the electronic edition will provide a powerful new tool for helping to determine the relative chronology of the manuscripts by means of source criticism and related techniques. At the same time, employing sophisticated techniques of electronic editing already being implemented at Indiana University (http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/newton), the editors are producing a web-based edition of great accessibility to the public. In the second phase, the electronic edition will enable end-users to navigate through text using a search and retrieval mechanism that will link transcript in one window to an image of the autograph text in a corresponding frame. Using on-screen windows, it will be possible to manipulate the high-resolution images and juxtapose them in ways not possible with the bound originals. The advanced user interface will also allow a user to label, group, sequence, re-sequence, and annotate discrete sections of text, effectively allowing the user to create his or her own ""edition."" The result of this project will be a resource that is available not only to professional historians and other scholars, but to anyone with an interest in the fascinating subject of Newton's chymistry, including public schools and other institutions.",William Newman|

These biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) have recently been identified in forests, and may be partially responsible for very rapid chemical reactions with atmospheric oxidants in these environments.  Experiments will include measurements of rate constants for the reactions of these compounds with OH and ozone, direct measurements of the yield of OH radicals produced by ozonolysis of these compounds, and identification and quantification of some of the products.  The experiments will use on-line mass spectrometry with relative rate techniques as well as discharge flow techniques with laser-induced fluorescence detection of OH.  This study should lead to improved knowledge of the details of some of the oxidation mechanisms and will help to determine the efficiency of these BVOCs in the production of photochemical smog.

However, there is growing evidence that the mean state has not been stable over long (geologic) timescales due to changes in sub-surface oceanic (thermocline) conditions, and that changes in the mean state have profound global climate effects that could explain the onset of the ice ages.  The proposed study will focus on the last 5 Ma of earth history, which includes the early Pliocene warm period, the most recent period of sustained global warmth relative to today, and the global cooling that led to the ice ages.  This project will test the hypotheses that 1) the early Pliocene warm period included El Nino-like mean conditions and the transition to cooler ice age climate was accompanied by a gradual shoaling of the thermocline and a switch from permanent 'El Nino-like' to modern 'normal' conditions and 2) higher frequency (41 kyr, glacial-interglacial) sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the tropical Pacific is related to changes in thermocline conditions.   To address these hypotheses, we will analyze the elemental (Mg/Ca) and stable isotope composition of fossil foraminifera as well as organic biomarkers and sediment composition from deep sea sediments to reconstruct SST, precipitation, wind strength, and thermocline depth.  This study will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the role of tropical Pacific processes in global climate change and will provide a data set for modelers to improve our interpretations and test their hierarchy of models.

Touched upon, but not as major a focus of prior research, are the decision-making dynamics that lead to reforestation-a process identified as a mechanism that can offset the loss of carbon due to global deforestation. This project addresses how the interactions between actors at different levels (local, state, federal) contribute to changes in land-use decision making that result in forest restoration and protection.  The investigators will examine coupled social, biophysical, and institutional dynamics of forest restoration in the states of Indiana (USA) and Sao Paulo (Brazil). Both states share a long history of settlement from the early 19th century that included rapid deforestation trajectories followed by rural-to-urban migration processes.  Forest Transition Theory suggests that shifts in civil society and government regulations make the transition from deforestation to reforestation possible.  The research will consider the ramifications of the contrasting legal systems for actors in forest change processes. The study methodology utilizes satellite imagery and GIS data developed for both regions, including topography and hydrology. Household surveys will be conducted to collect information on household attributes, land-use preferences, and awareness of policies related to resource management. Interviews will be conducted with local government officials and managers of nongovernmental organizations, land trusts, and local stakeholder groups active in the study areas (e.g., farmer associations, land developers). The surveys and interviews will be used to inform the development of household-level agent-based models of land-cover change in both study areas. We will integrate spatial methods with tools from experimental economics as a means of testing key decision-making theories to inform the decision making in agent-based models.    The broader impact of the proposed research will be its examination of why the rate of deforestation slows in some areas and the feedbacks and forces that then lead to reforestation. An important part of the research will be the role that Non-Governmental Organizations play in forest restoration efforts.  Theories of forest cover change in developed economies will be further developed to determine how the dynamics of deforestation and reforestation are affected by both local-level stakeholders and state and federal agents of change.  The results have the potential to inform policies and programs designed to encourage reforestation and carbon sequestration, and potentially mitigate climate change.

The idealized view of fault coupling involving an interseismically locked section that ruptures in earthquakes, with aseismically creeping sections above and below the locked zone, is inconsistent with observations from a number of plate boundary faults. For example, the San Andreas fault is locked above about 15 km depth south of Parkfield, California, but north of Parkfield, the San Andreas is creeping at typically seismogenic depths. Kinematic slip inversions from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake and the 2003 Tokachi-oki, Japan earthquake show significant afterslip at typically seismogenic depths, along strike from the mainshocks. This research utilizes GPS data from these two earthquakes and the 2004 Parkfield, California earthquake to investigate the distribution of slip and frictional properties on faults. Numerical models of afterslip implementing laboratory derived rate-state friction laws are being developed and implemented in inversions of postseismic GPS time-series data for frictional parameters. The observations of aseismic slip at seismogenic depths raise important questions about frictional properties on the fault and along-strike variations of slip behavior. Faults within the seismogenic part of the crust are generally assumed to be steady-state velocity weakening. Yet, velocity weakening friction does not always lead to unstable slip and and velocity strengthening friction does not always lead to stable slip. This study investigates the conditions on the fault that allow for the spatial variations in slip behavior. High-rate GPS data recorded at 1 Hz following the Parkfield and Tokachi-oki earthquakes is being used to investigate the transition from dynamic slip during the earthquake to stable creep following the earthquake. The nature of the transition from unstable may provide further constraints on the frictional properties on the fault.",Kaj Johnson|

It unites the eight million Haitians of all backgrounds living in Haiti with the Haitian Diaspora in the United States, Canada, France and other countries around the world. The United States boasts the largest and most important segment of the Haitian Diaspora, numbering more than one million, and for whom Creole is a heritage language. In Haiti, Haitian Creole is recognized along with French as the co-official language; however, 90% of the population speak only that language. Haitian Creole has the distinction of being one of the few creoles that has developed a standardized written form used in the administrative and educational spheres and disseminated by the media, especially through radio. The standardized written form is based principally on the variety spoken in and around the capital, Port-au-Prince. It differs widely from the dialect spoken in the Cape Haitian region, which was the main urban center during the French colonial period. A significant innovation of the proposed study is its focus on the interaction between the standardized variety and the Cape Haitian dialect.  Another important contribution is the compilation of a massive database illustrating the heretofore little described Cape Haitian dialect that will be made available to the scholarly community and interested persons in the form of a CD-ROM.    The spread of a prestige form of a language from the capital city outward, which characterizes the development of major languages like English and French, can typically only be reconstructed indirectly. This study will make possible direct observation of the processes that shape this development. The research will help to determine the extent to which the pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary that characterize the Cape Haitian dialect are being replaced by corresponding forms of the standard variety spoken in Port-au-Prince. Moreover, since the Cape Haitian dialect reflects earlier forms of the language, the study will also shed light on the development of Haitian Creole, as well as that of creole languages in general. Data will be collected in Cape Haitian and in the surrounding rural areas from older subjects as well as middle school students who are being schooled in Haitian Creole. Faculty and students of a teacher-training college located in Cape Haitian will collaborate in conducting the research along with American graduate students. The Haitian collaborators will gain valuable training in studying the social factors that shape language use, while their American counterparts will be provided with an opportunity to conduct fieldwork in a cultural context highly different from their own.",Albert Valdman|

Recent work in this laboratory (NSF IBN-0235223) suggested that H2S impacts cardiovascular function in all vertebrates and it also led to the novel hypothesis that H2S is the heretofore elusive oxygen ""sensor"" producing hypoxic relaxation in systemic vessels and hypoxic constriction in pulmonary vessels. This project  will examine how H2S mediates hypoxic responses in blood vessels and how this signal is transduced into contraction or relaxation. It will also determine the role of H2S in general cardiovascular function in primitive vertebrates. Electrophysiological studies on single smooth muscle cells, biochemical and biophysical studies of isolated blood vessels, and complete cardiovascular measurements on unanesthetized animals will be performed on a variety of vertebrates, from primitive hagfish to mammals. These studies will provide the first comprehensive investigation of the novel hypothesis that H2S is the key component in oxygen ""sensing"" in blood vessels and they will identify the phylogenetic origin and impact of H2S in the vertebrate cardiovascular system. The results will have broad implications for all of vertebrate physiology by resolving the long-standing conundrum of vascular oxygen sensing and they will provide an evolutionary window into the integrative role of H2S in the vertebrate cardiovascular system. This work is also relevant to environmental biology because H2S is often a byproduct of industrial and agricultural activity and it is potentially debilitating to aquatic vertebrates.

Little is known about how DNA and histone methyltransferase enzymes are controlled and targeted to appropriate genomic sites for action. This laboratory cloned CpG binding protein (CGBP), a novel factor that binds DNA containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, the site of cytosine methylation in mammals. This factor is also a component of the Set1 histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex. Disruption of the CGBP gene leads to embryonic death in mice, and embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking CGBP are unable to differentiate in vitro and carry altered patterns of epigenetic modifications such as reduced cytosine methylation. They also contain elevated levels of histone H3-Lys4 methylation, correlated with inappropriate drifting of the Set1 protein into heterochromatin. Thus, CGBP is a regulator of both major classes of epigenetic modifications. The CGBP -/- mutant phenotype is """"rescued"""" upon introduction of a CGBP-expression vector, thus offering an experimental system with which to probe structure/function relationships of CGBP. The specific aims are: (1) Determine domains of CGBP that are necessary and sufficient to rescue epigenetic modifications in CGBP -/- ES cells. Various truncated or mutated versions of CBGP will be introduced into CGBP-/- ES cells. Clones expressing physiologic levels of these CGBP variants will be examined for genomic cytosine methylation, DNA methyltransferase activity, sub-nuclear targeting of the Set1 histone methyltransferase complex, and histone H3-Lys4 and Lys9 methylation. (2) Determine domains of CGBP that are necessary and sufficient to rescue developmental potential of CGBP -/- ES cells. Transfected ES cell clones isolated in Specific Aim #1 will be assessed for developmental capacity. ES clones will be induced to differentiate in vitro by the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor from the growth media, and differentiation will be assessed by morphological examination of subsequent embryoid body formation, and by histochemical detection of alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of stem cells. RT-PCR will also be performed to assess the expression of a panel of stem cell and lineage-restricted molecular markers. In vivo developmental potential of """"rescued"""" ES cell lines will be assessed by isolating cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), injecting these cells into blastocysts, and introduction into pseudo-pregnant mice to produce chimeric animals. The contribution of ES cells to each tissue will be examined by fluorescence microscopy.

Currently there are three typical protocols to analyze glycoproteins: oligosaccharides are released from proteins and then are analyzed by tandem or even higher MS to elucidate their structures; glycoproteins are enriched and then identified by tandem MS using typical proteomics methodologies without addressing glycans explicitly; and glycoproteins are purified and analyzed by MS/MS to characterize and profile the microheterogeneity of site-specific glycosylations. Glycomics projects require intensive computational analysis of the MS spectra. The objective of this proposal is to develop computational methods for solving several fundamental problems emerging from MS-based glycomics projects, and to develop urgently needed courses and tutorials for educating students and researchers in glycoinformatics. It consists of three specific aims: (1) to continue developing algorithms and software for characterizing oligosaccharide structures, including their sequences, branchings and linkages, from tandem mass spectra; (2) to develop algorithms and software for characterizing site-specific glycosylations in glycoproteins from their LC/MS/MS analyses; and (3) to develop new courses in glycoinformatics and proteome informatics. The success of these goals will provide useful software tools and teaching materials to the glycomics community.

Protein prenylation, the attachment of an isoprenoid lipid to a protein, is one mechanism by which proteins are targeted to appropriate sites and/or modified for interaction with other proteins.  While this process has been studied in detail, the degradation of prenylated proteins and the fate of the isoprenoid lipid have not been described in plants.  The degradation of prenylated proteins results in the release of a prenylcysteine (i.e., either farnesylcysteine or geranylgeranylcysteine) with the isoprenoid attached to the amino acid cysteine via thioether linkage.  Prenylcysteine metabolism in plants is important, at least in part, because prenylcysteine compounds cause an enhanced response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA).  This project will examine the farnesylcysteine lyase enzyme that metabolizes farnesylcysteine to farnesal and cysteine in the cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  A gene on chromosome 5 of the Arabidopsis genome encodes this enzyme and mutations in this gene cause an enhanced response to ABA, presumably because of farnesylcysteine accumulation.  This project will also examine the metabolism of geranylgeranylcysteine, which proceeds by a different mechanism.  Thus, plants possess at least two distinct mechanisms for prenylcysteine metabolism, one for farnesylcysteine and one for geranylgeranylcysteine, and these processes are required for normal ABA responsiveness.  To test the hypothesis that the enzymes involved in prenylcysteine metabolism are important for isoprenoid salvage and detoxification and to describe in detail the role of prenylcysteine metabolism in ABA signaling, biochemical analyses on Arabidopsis prenylcysteine metabolic enzymes will be performed and the corresponding genes identified.  In addition, the subcellular locations of Arabidopsis prenylcysteine metabolic enzymes and the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants deficient in prenylcysteine metabolic enzymes will be analyzed.  Finally, the regulation of genes encoding prenylcysteine metabolic enzymes in Arabidopsis will be examined.  This work will significantly contribute to a better understanding of the metabolism of prenylated proteins and the role of prenylcysteine salvage/detoxification in plant growth and development.

Fisher    The main thrust of the proposed research is to introduce  and develop new analytic techniques in group theory and  the study of group actions.  Major projects include:  (a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of  coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work  with Eskin and Whyte)  (b) developing harmonic map techniques in rigidity  theory, particularly in the context of infinite  dimensional target spaces and  (c) developing a normal form theory for group actions  based on new generalizations and variants of hard  implicit function theorems.    All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of  rigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. The grant  will also support summer schools devoted to new  developments in rigidity theory. The field is broad and  not entirely well defined, new developments frequently  involve ideas from other areas of mathematics. These  summer schools will provide students and young  scientists the opportunity to learn about new  developments quickly and to build the professional  networks required to remain abreast of future new  developments.    In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is  often played by the symmetries of the object --  particularly when the object has many symmetries. The PI  investigates ways of characterizing, describing and  studying spaces with many symmetries in various  dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These  questions are interdisciplinary in nature and often  require learning, adapting and applying ideas and  techniques from many areas of mathematics. The PI's work  has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from  celestial mechanics (KAM theory and stability of the  solar system) to theoretical computer science (expander  graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding  problems).

It is now known that there are over 200 PTM types that modulate protein activity in eukaryotic organisms by acting as molecular switches which turn on and off protein function, stabilize it or target for destruction or determine its cellular location. The objective is to carry out the following research activities: (Aim 1) Develop models for automated annotation of PTM sites (Aim 2) Analyze structural and functional properties of PTM sites (Aim 3) Integrate protein bioinformatics and proteomics to construct functional map of all major PTMs Intellectual Merit. This project introduces a novel framework of integrating protein bioinformatics and proteomics towards comprehensive understanding of the regulatory and signaling roles of PTMs. In addition to the new biological knowledge, this project will develop a set of tools that will enable accurate and efficient proteomics analysis and also aid experimental biologists in experimental design. Combinatorial explosion is currently the major hindrance in proteomics studies of PTMs and cellular processes they are involved in. Thus, the proposed prioritization of the proteomics searches by incorporating PTM prediction will not only make such studies realistic, but also enable identification of many new sites by decreasing the effective database size. PTMs frequently occur in unstructured protein regions that cannot be easily studied using traditional experimental methods (X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy) and structural bioinformatics. Developing sequence based methods to predict PTM sites, integrating them into proteomics searches for verification, and investigating relationship between PTMs and genetic data may be crucial for understanding the molecular basis of many diseases, thus facilitating drug design and clinical therapy. The far-reaching promise of understanding life at a molecular level and advancing medical research can be fulfilled only through an integration of research and interdisciplinary education. To achieve this goal, the PI will extend and develop new courses at graduate and undergraduate level, will expose students to advanced education, and, through an active, rigorous and enthusiastic learning environment; train a generation of new experts and researchers who will be capable of making further advances. The teaching material and research results will be disseminated via our web site, by publishing papers in internationally recognized journals and by attending major conferences. The educational plan of this project will ensure participation of underrepresented minority and socioeconomic groups in research by partnering with the Office of Strategic Mentoring (OSM) and Alliances for Graduate and Professoriate Program (AGEP) at Indiana University. Two vital components of this plan are (i) attracting underrepresented students through OSM/AGEP and courses addressing data mining and bioinformatics, and (ii) retaining and promoting underrepresented students through committing funding, advising and mentoring.",Predrag Radivojac|

Run 2 will provide a new era of exploration and potential discovery at the energy frontier. The expanded capabilities of the detectors and the accelerator will allow the direct study of one of the most pressing issues in all of particle physics: the origin of mass. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field provides a means of generating particle masses and spontaneously breaking the symmetry of the electroweak interaction. Precision measurements performed over the last decade have confirmed that something akin to the Standard Model process of mass generation must exist, but the Higgs boson, the physical manifestation of the Higgs field, has yet to be observed. Seeing it and measuring its properties would be an important step in our understanding of the fundamental structure of nature and should point the way toward a larger theory of which the Standard Model is only a part.  Achieving the ambitious goal of discovering the Higgs boson is currently only possible at the Tevatron, provided that the amount of data delivered to the experiments is increased by an order of magnitude over that originally anticipated for the current run. This requires larger interaction rates resulting in increased detector backgrounds, and will force the experiment to be far more selective in the events written to permanent storage for analysis.

Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) are the primary tools available for constructing such projections, but downscaling tools are needed to obtain climate change information at spatial scales relevant for assessing impacts.  Downscaling methods have tended to underestimate the variability of geophysical variables and hence are of limited utility when seeking to quantify changes in extreme (or large magnitude) events.  This research project focuses on application of innovative statistical downscaling tools to output from multiple coupled AOGCMs to obtain descriptors of the probability distributions of daily precipitation occurrence and wet-day precipitation amount for stations throughout the contiguous USA.  The results will allow us to examine the frequency and magnitude of precipitation events in the 21st century relative to those derived from newly-developed century-long precipitation records from the 20th century.  The large number of AOGCM simulations used will also allow an unprecedented opportunity to explicitly consider model-based uncertainty and thereby assess confidence in the derived projections.    The research conducted under through project closely relates to the activities of the 4th Assessment team of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by utilizing climate model products generated within that program.  It also is highly complementary with the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), which is focused solely on dynamical downscaling of multiple variables, including precipitation.  The comparison of the results of this project with those from NARCCAP will encompass both statistical and dynamical downscaling to present a comprehensive overview of the range of possible climate states and trajectories.

In many occasions, this ""idealization"" approach has proven itself to be useful in elucidating core properties of syntax that do not seem to be attributable to any other cognitive faculty.  Despite their vigorous quest for theoretical sophistication, however, theoretical linguists have generally made little effort to establish reliable methods of soliciting and ascertaining speakers' acceptability and grammaticality judgments.    One of the goals of this project is to build up a more precise, objective and consensual research method than those generally exercised in the formal approach to language. Taking up wh-questions (e.g., What did you eat?) in Japanese as the main empirical domain of investigation, the project will emphasize the need for attention to a larger context of language such as prosody and pragmatics for establishing a more precise and reliable methodology of eliciting grammaticality judgments.  Some phonetic and psycholinguistic experiments will be carried out in order to verify and consolidate the initial observations and intuitions concerning the direct and indirect influence of extra-syntactic factors on the interpretation of wh-questions.  The project will attempt to demonstrate that such an approach is essential in order to give a clear definition of the empirical domain for formal syntax, and that exercising such caution may be the key to bring back order to the chaos often observed in the field.

The problems of scaling and  universality are central in many areas of modern science: theory of  critical phenomena and phase transitions, statistical physics and  quantum field theory, theory of quantum chaos, nonlinear dynamics,  etc. This project is directed on development of powerful mathematical  methods to the problems of scaling and universality in the  theory of  random matrices, random polynomials, and related topics. It  involves  different areas of mathematics: analysis, theory of integrable  systems,  probability theory, semiclassical asymptotics for systems of  differential equations, complex analysis, etc. The research project  under consideration has  direct applications to various physical  problems: combinatorial asymptotics related to quantum gravity,  exactly solvable models of statistical physics, spin systems on random  surfaces, theory of critical phenomena and phase transitions, quantum  chaos. Possible further applications include  theory of knots and  links and related problems in molecular biology,  growth models,  statistical data analysis, and others.",Pavel Bleher|

The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes how quarks are bound together by particles called gluons and suggests that the glouns holding the quarks together manifest themselves in small bundles or tubes between the quarks. Excitations of these ""flux tubes,"" which can be visualized like a jump rope rotating between the quarks, lead to a new family of particles called exotic hybrids that exhibit both the properties of quarks and gluons. The experimental observation and study of these exotic particles is the goal of several current and planned experiments and will ultimately require utilization of computer grids to analyze the petabyte-scale data sets that will be produced by future experiments.    Exotic hybrids have unique sets of so-called quantum numbers that characterize their intrinsic spin, differences in how the matter and antimatter partners behave, and what happens to their properties when one examines them in a mirror. The identification of a particle's quantum numbers is done by using detectors to collect large samples of decays of the particle and then describing the patterns of decays using a procedure called an ""amplitude analysis."" The observed distributions that characterize decay patterns are then fitted to mathematical functions that depend on the particle's quantum numbers and other theoretical assumptions.  The unambiguous identification of exotic hybrids requires a systematic application of this amplitude analysis and this, in turn, calls for a close collaboration between experimentalists and phenomenologists to understand how experimental and theoretical biases could affect conclusions.    This project will develop a suite of analysis tools built on the backbone of the Open Science Grid, that would allow transparent analysis of current and future experimental data. The open access analysis paradigm being developed in this project will facilitate direct access to data by phenomenologists and their students for testing theoretical models that underpin the amplitude analysis technique. The tools developed will be open-source and will be utilized by future projects or experiments that plan to provide open access to data.      Our analysis framework, coupled with new high quality data, will address problems that hindered earlier analyses that sometimes led to ambiguous or erroneous conclusions.",Ryan Mitchell|Geoffrey Fox|Matthew Shepherd

The objects of study in dynamical systems have very complicated (fractal) structures that require detailed combinatorial descriptions.

However, many software libraries provide complex interfaces to make the library adaptable to application-specific needs. This complexity raises the cost of adoption and reduces the benefits of software reuse. Researchers discovered that libraries can be made more versatile and easier to use if the underlying programming language provides library authors with constructs for reasoning, during the compilation of the application, about program metadata and for customizing the library implementation based on this information. Current programming languages provide these features in an immature form and the state of the art in programming language theory does not yet reach this combination of features. The investigators are advancing the theory to bring type safety and modularity to this context and they are working closely with the C++ Standards Committee to transfer their results to industrial practice.    The combination of language features needed to reason about metadata and customize libraries is called reflective metaprogramming. Previous research in this area provides type safety and modularity for metaprogramming but not reflective metaprogramming. The investigators are researching type safety for reflective metaprogramming through a careful integration of 1) a meta-language that provides computation over values and types and that provides reflection over all the program's metadata, 2) a facility for classifying types, and 3) a type system that provides hooks into the meta-language using dependent types. By developing a more reliable and expressive metaprogramming system, this research improves programmer productivity for both the developers and users of software libraries because many more bugs will be caught early in the development cycle by the modular type system.",Andrew Lumsdaine|

These simple animals also harbor a vast, yet stable population of symbiotic microorganisms that are often the source for the medicinally active compounds. In addition to generating useful metabolites for the host animal these microbes can also perform other important functions, including acquisition of limiting nutrients and protection against harmful disease agents. The microbial communities  within sponges are complex and diverse, representing many different types of microbes with a great range of capabilities. As with most complex microbial communities, there is virtually no understanding of the factors and mechanisms that establish and stabilize the microbiota in sponges. For marine sponges, it is unclear how specific microbes are introduced and maintained in the face of the huge volume of microbe-containing seawater surrounding them, and how the appropriate balance of different microbes is fostered within the sponge tissue. One mechanism by which bacteria coordinate their activities is through the exchange of chemical signals. Over recent years it has become clear that many bacteria can ""converse"" through different chemical languages, and that this microbial conversation can have a major impact on microbial community function. In a related NSF Microbial Observatory project, a large group of sponge-associated microbes has been found to produce a specific family of communication signals called acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), known to regulate diverse processes including antibiotic synthesis, nutrient acquisition, and microbial gene exchange in other bacteria. AHLs are prime candidates for factors that shape the sponge community and facilitate coordination of microbial activities. This study will test the pervasiveness and importance of these signaling mechanisms for the well-characterized microbial communities of several shallow-water, tropical sponges. Advanced chemical, biochemical, molecular, microscopic and microbiological analyses will be applied to determine the extent to which these indigenous microorganisms communicate within the sponge, the functions under control of the signaling, and the connection to important attributes of the sponge, including production of novel metabolites.    The study will provide broad insights into the ways that microbial communities proliferate and mature during host association, the regulation of microbial activity to promote symbiosis rather than disease, and the functional relationships between these microbes and the sponge. In a wider sense, this study will advance understanding of complex symbiotic processes and contribute to knowledge on signaling in interactions between bacteria and their hosts. This interdisciplinary project involves three different laboratories with different areas of expertise, and will train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in ways that bridge the traditional areas of chemistry, ecology and molecular microbiology. Undergraduate student participation is also an important component of the study.

The essential physics may often be understood in terms of effective degrees of freedom other than those of the underlying electrons, allowing for simplified descriptions of fluctuating or correlated states that cannot be understood in terms of standard Fermi liquid theory. The PI will focus on two specific systems as paradigms: graphene and quantum Hall bilayers.    Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon network, is unusual among two-dimensional electron gas systems for several reasons. The electrons near the Fermi level are ""massless,"" and obey a Dirac equation. This leads to unique physics related to the ""Klein paradox"" for relativistic particles, in which an electron current may penetrate a barrier via the admixture of hole states. In graphene this implies that electrons cannot be confined solely by an electrostatic potential. The consequences of this for many-body states of broken spatial symmetries, and fluctuation-induced states based upon them, will be examined. The PI will also study the impact of the valley degree of freedom which allows the possibility of unusual orderings in such states, particularly in the quantum Hall regime.  In addition, the sublattice degree of freedom leads to an unusual Berry's phase with many interesting consequences for transport and interference effects, which will also be examined. The PI will investigate consequences of curvature and topological defects for the electronic properties of graphene.   Quantum Hall bilayers near filling factor 1 are special in displaying an ""imperfect"" superfluidity - a counterflow resistance that appears to vanish in the zero temperature limit, and a strong but finite resonance in tunneling conductance. The underlying state that allows such unusual behavior to emerge remains poorly understood. The PI aims to determine how quantum fluctuations may lead to such behavior, under the premise that disorder plays a crucial role. Studies designed to understand some recent experiments within this context will also be pursued.    NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This award supports fundamental theoretical research and education on the electronic states of materials in two spatial dimensions. The PI will focus his research on graphene and quantum Hall bilayers - two layer systems of electrons in high magnetic fields. Each of these systems has electronic states that differ dramatically from standard textbook wisdom. For example, the electrons in graphene behave like particles of light and are governed by Einstein's theory of relativity recast in the quantum world.  The quantum Hall bilayers exhibit a new state of matter that appears like an imperfect superconductor. This work represents fundamental research that seeks to understand these new states of matter. Graphene is also an important candidate for new technologies. This research contributes to understanding graphene's unusual properties and contributes to the knowledge base that will enable new technologies to keep America competitive.     This research will be conducted with the full participation of graduate students, who will be trained in modern methods for analyzing condensed matter systems, preparing them for careers in science and technology. Finally the research will be performed in collaboration with scientists from the US and abroad, strengthening and enriching the US physical community.",Herbert Fertig|

Many of these questions are set in a group-invariant context and the goal is to understand how geometric or algebraic properties of the group are reflected in probabilistic properties of the processes.  The PI is working to establish basic topological properties of higher-dimensional analogues of random forests and to establish conjectures that arise by analogy to percolation.  Phase transitions and entropy of other determinantal dynamical systems are also under investigation. Coupling questions are also at the heart of some stochastic comparison inequalities being studied. Basic questions concern comparison of the behavior of random walks in  two random environments. In addition, the PI is investigating whether all groups are sofic by  investigating whether all unimodular probability measures on rooted networks are sofic.    The field of statistical physics is concerned to a great extent with mathematical models of phase transitions (e.g., water to ice). Typically the model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions. This lattice is infinite and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group.  The simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in the ground and gas flow through a gas mask. One asks how far fluid can flow, in particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far. This, of course, depends on the density of particles that block the flow; there is a phase transition as the density  increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can no longer flow arbitrarily far. One would like to know where that point is and how the probability changes as this critical point is approached.  About 20 years ago, several researchers began investigating lattices that are quite  different from the usual Euclidean ones that are most familiar and that most closely correspond to our physical world. These new lattices, called nonamenable, are also usually based on groups. Such investigations began out of the usual scientific and mathematical curiosity that drives fundamental research.  Within the last 10 years, this area of research, statistical physics on nonamenable groups, has seen an explosion of interest.  This area of research turns out to be quite rich and to contain a large number of important fundamental questions whose answers remain unknown.  Already, there have been applications to Euclidean lattices of some of the new ideas that have arisen  in response to the need to develop new tools for nonamenable groups.",Russell Lyons|

It will employ the well-defined """"design for values"""" method to create an innovative toolkit that can be used by our aging population, their caregivers, and designers to ensure privacy and autonomy in home-based ubicomp.    Ubiquitous computing integrates technology into our everyday environments, fundamentally altering privacy by creating continuous, detailed data flows. Ubicomp will result in an environment that is aware, active and responsive. It creates an aware environment through the pervasive distribution of sensors. It is active because sensor data are processed and examined. It is responsive in that the technology acts on the environment based on processed data. As ubicomp is networked, the data and decisions have the potential to be observed from any connected locale on the planet.    Design for privacy is complicated by the fact that privacy is a socially constructed value that differs significantly across environments and individuals. Currently, design for privacy requires a user who understands the social implications of ubicomp technology, demands a design that respects privacy, and articulates specific technical design requirements. Design for privacy also requires a ubicomp designer with mastery of privacy enhancing technologies, security mechanisms, and a profound understanding of privacy. Neither of these is a reasonable burden. This research will decrease the burdens for both parties.    This project will create a system for designing highly customized privacy?-enhancing ubicomp. The privacy framework that consists of three integrated, complementary components. The first component is a participant tool for eliciting individual elder privacy concerns, making it easy for non-technical people to express privacy concerns. The second is a designer tool that translates elder concerns into technical choices or suggestions. The third is a privacy-enhancing code library for ubicomp sensors that vastly simplifies privacy-sensitive design, including data filtering, access control list creation, and integration of cryptographic privacy enhancing technologies.

The principal goal of the proposal is to deepen the recently introduced geometric and algebraic methods in the theory of knot cobordism in dimension three and to extend this theory to a wider class of topological objects including virtual knots and virtual strings.

This study will assist in advancing our understanding of biological invasions by examining all of these factors together, and asking how their relative importance changes with soil fertility, which is a major environmental gradient in nature.  The study will be conducted using experimentally constructed plant communities modeled on native mid-western prairie grasslands of low and high soil fertility. Native plant diversity, disturbance and nutrient inputs will be systematically manipulated in these communities, and the communities will be exposed to an array of functionally diverse invasive species.  This study will directly address a gap in knowledge of biological invasions by providing insights into the relative importance of key factors in promoting invasions.  The insights gained from this study may enhance both the ability to predict and to manage invasions of grasslands and other communities. Furthermore, this study will be conducted at the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve, a resource that offers excellent opportunities for fostering both undergraduate research activity and communicating science to the local community.",Heather Reynolds|

The rocks are associated with the Proterozoic Midcontinent Rift System (MRS), and are thought to represent feeders to early-stage, rift-related volcanics. Country rocks include Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks that are locally graphitic and sulfidic; these rocks appeared to be likely sources for S contained in the igneous rocks, However, sulfides in the igneous rocks are characterized by d34S values less than 4 per mil, whereas sulfides in the Proterozoic rocks show a d34S range from ~10 to 40 per mil. Preliminary S isotopic analyses indicate a range of d33S values from 0.02 to -0.7 per mil, indicating significant mass independent fractionation of S isotopes that to date has only been documented in Archean rocks. Thus, most of the S contained in the Eagle deposit must be derived from Archean rocks, rather than from the sulfide-rich Proterozoic rocks. To verify and understand this surprising result, a detailed investigation of d33S variations is proposed for the Eagle deposit, as well as both Proterozoic and Archean country rocks. Multiple S isotope studies have proven to be important to the continuing evaluation of Earth's early atmosphere. However, recent studies have shown that mass independently fractionated S isotopes (MIF-S) may not be restricted to rocks greater that ~2 Ga in age. The proposed stratigraphically controlled study at Eagle will provide information on the distribution of d33S values in the igneous rocks and related sulfide mineralization, in the Proterozoic (two sequences, one of ~ 2.2-2.4 Ga and the other of ~1.8-1.9 Ga, which will cover important intervals in Earth history with respect to MIF-S), and in the Archean rocks. We also plan to analyze gabbroic rocks with associated Cu-Ni sulfide mineralization found in the Duluth Complex of Minnesota, located on the north side of the rift. In these samples d34S values of the sulfide accumulations are similar to the values of iron sulfides in carbonaceous, 1.8 to 1.9 Ga country rocks. This association is much different from that at Eagle, and presents an opportunity to contrast multiple S isotope systematics in mineralized systems that formed at different times in the development of the MRS. Oxygen isotope analyses of olivine and plagioclase in the rocks at Eagle will also be undertaken to investigate the relative importance of devolatilization and partial melting of country rocks in transferring MIF-S to the magmatic system. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of magmatic sulfide ore formation in the MRS, will shed light on the nature of interaction between mantle-derived magmas and crustal rocks at various times in the developing rift, and provide insight into S mass independent fractionation on Earth.    Broader impacts. The proposed research represents a collaboration between academia and the minerals industry. Kennecott will fund a graduate student fellowship as part of the project, as well as limited geochronologic, mineralogical and geochemical studies. In addition, reserves of Ni and platinum-group elements in the United States are low and studies of this type are needed to evaluate known resources and to develop exploration models. Both graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the collaboration with mining industry, and will receive training in the utilization of state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation and in methods of scientific investigation.",Chusi Li|Edward Ripley

Triassic sedimentary sequences hold a record of the earliest stages of arc volcanism along the Cordilleran continental margin, a record poorly preserved in the remnant plutonic arc dismembered by voluminous Middle to Late Mesozoic plutonism. Drawing on the rich base of previously published information about the stratigraphy of the Chinle and Moenkopi formations on the Colorado Plateau, this study is expanding the understanding of volcanic material found in the Triassic rocks of the Plateau, and characterizing proposed or likely equivalents to the Colorado Plateau section in southern and western Arizona and in eastern California.  A variety of methods used to address these issues includes U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from ash beds and tuffaceous sandstones to provide a complete age spectrum for the Chinle Formation; analysis of volcanic clasts in the Chinle Formation for age and complete chemistry; study of detrital zircons in known or suspected Triassic clastic rocks in southern and western Arizona for provenance data; and complete geochemical characterization of igneous clasts in these units and in the El Antimonio Group of Sonora, Mexico.  These data will mesh with the growing body of information being obtained from similar-age plutons in the Mojave Desert of southeastern California.  The comparison will allow testing of the hypothesis that the remnant plutonic arc and its volcanic cover were the source of airborne ash and stream-borne clastic material that mixed with locally derived detritus to deposit the Buckskin Formation and related units in the proximal retroarc area of western Arizona, the Gardner Canyon and other, unnamed arc-proximal units in southern Arizona, and the Moenkopi and Chinle formations in the relatively distal retroarc region.    The research will provide a new view of plate movement along the west coast of North America during Mesozoic time, including an improved understanding of the hypothesis that the western margin of the continent was translated southeastward into northern Mexico. The study will also give clues as to the ancient topography of western North America, including where major volcanoes stood, and where major rivers flowed.

These observed patterns will be used to place limits on regional and temporal variations in mantle and crustal contributions to magmas which ultimately form arc plutons and feed large-volume volcanic eruptions. Preliminary data show large regional variations in the age of magma source rocks, and also show that younger plutons were derived from distinct crustal sources compared to adjacent older plutons. These regional and temporal differences in magma sources will therefore allow a better understanding of the processes occurring at depth, especially changes in thermal structure, melt hybridization, or lithospheric thickening by retro-arc shortening, that may have contributed to high volume magmatism in this long-lived arc setting.    Volcanoes commonly form at the boundary between colliding tectonic plates, and these volcanoes are the surface expression of a collision process that is central to the origin of Earth''s continents. However, because the processes that generate this volcanic activity occur out of sight deep within the Earth, we still have much to understand about the volcanic process and its link to colliding plates. This project will examine a series of volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks formed over about 180 million years during a very long-lived, yet now extinct plate collision in the southwestern United States. The purpose of examining this very long record of activity in an extinct setting, where not only the volcanoes but their underlying rocks are exposed to view, is to develop an integrated understanding of the plate collision and magma-generating processes. Thus, this project has broader significance in that it is designed to unify aspects of both igneous petrology and structural geology, as the ideas of these disciplines are applied to plate collisions. The project will also support the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the earth sciences, by supporting supervised independent field and laboratory experiences. These independent studies assist students by helping them to see the application and integration of knowledge they have acquired in the classroom and by encouraging them to persist in their education. Finally, because much of the field research will take place in and around Joshua Tree National Park in California, the knowledge gained during the course of this study will be translated into continuing education of thousands of park visitors each year.",Andrew Barth|

The IB method has been widely used to simulate problems involving interactions of an elastic structure and an incompressible viscous fluid.  Because of the attractive relative simplicity of an explicit IB method numerous explicit versions of the method have been used in practice.  However, an explicit IB method has a drawback: the time-step size must be small to maintain numerical stability of the immersed solid boundary which is not economical in computational cost, especially for three dimensional problems.  The investigator develops a 3D implicit IB method by implementing an implicit scheme for computing forces imparted by the immersed boundary to the fluid and for updating the solid boundary configuration.  Because the mixed Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of the fundamental variables and their complicated interconnections, a highly nonlinear algebraic system of equations has to be solved for each time step to advance the solution.  In order to reduce the complexity of the 3D implicit IB method and to facilitate its parallel implementation, the lattice Boltzmann method (the D3Q19 model) is used to solve the incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, The investigator studies an efficient preconditioner based on inherent properties of the problem for expediting the solution of the nonlinear algebraic system  of equations.  The investigator applies the new implicit IB method to investigate the drag reduction process associated with a flexible sheet of finite thickness immersed in a flowing viscous fluid. The objective is to develop scaling laws for drag with respect to oncoming flow speed, Reynolds number, dimensionless bending modulus and dimensionless mass density.  More advanced applications include modeling and simulation of the primary cilia and the endothelial surface layer interacting with viscous moving fluids.    Nature is very rich in problems involving interactions of a flexible body and a fluid (e.g., a flapping flag in the air).  Such interactions underlie a wide range of phenomena in science and engineering which are very complicated and not yet well understood.  The investigator studies a numerical method for investigating the fluid-flexible-body-interaction through large-scale scientific computing using modern supercomputers.  The method is applicable to many important problems in science and biomedical engineering. One immediate application is study of drag reduction induced by body flexibility.  The major energy expense for underwater propulsion is used for overcoming the resistance (drag) of ambient fluid. One aim of a hydrodynamic design is to reduce the drag experienced by an immersed body (e.g. a vehicle).  Reduced drag means improved propulsion efficiency and lowered energy cost.  The investigator's study may inspire genesis and development of novel designs of underwater propelling technologies with improved efficiency and increased speed.  More sophisticated applications include modeling and simulations of the primary cilia of the epithelial cells interacting with the moving viscous fluid in the kidney tubules, which is related to the polycystic kidney disease, and studying the genesis of atherosclerosis (leading cause of heart attacks and stokes) in which blood flow with transport and reacting constituents interacting with a compliant vessel wall covered by an endothelial surface layer.

The project will focus on everyday life at remote hunter-gatherer campsites to advance our understanding of Native American responses to contact and colonialism.  The effects of colonialism on mobile hunter-gatherers remains understudied, and recent theoretical advances in culture contact studies have yet to be applied to the Great Plains of North America and the remote wilderness of the eastern Rockies and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem during the turbulent years between A.D. 1600 and 1900.  This project is the first of its kind to integrate culture contact perspectives at hunter-gatherer sites where cultural affiliation is secure.    The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is an excellent place to examine colonialism in the American West.  Wildfires in the Shoshone National Forest in 2003 exposed campsites and mountain sheep butchering facilities associated with extensive sheep hunting traps constructed by Mountain Shoshone peoples.  The thousands of artifacts and features visible on these burned surfaces provide a rare opportunity to examine spatial and temporal dimensions of daily life and the activities of hunter-gatherers in residential settings, which serve as evidence of responses to colonialism.  The research team will focus on four critical periods spanning the protohistoric-historic transition: the expansion of Plains Indians into traditional Shoshone homelands, the initial contact between the Mountain Shoshone and Euroamerican explorers and fur traders, the sustained contact and participation in the fur trade, and the increasing cultural conflicts resulting from the Plains Indian Wars and establishment of reservations in the western U.S.      The research design for this project addresses change through time in Mountain Shoshone 1) landscape use, 2) food practices, and 3) technological organization.  The research team will investigate the reasons why the Mountain Shoshone chose to live in the remote wilderness, and the relationships between these choices and expanding frontier borders, the intensification of sheep hunting, and more specialized subsistence economies.  The team will also examine whether exchange networks for obsidian (volcanic glass for stone tool manufacture) and the sustained use of pre-contact technology in post-contact settings reflects differential access to raw materials, resistance to change, and/or colonial entanglements.  The research will employ the methods of systematic survey, excavations, detailed surface mapping, obsidian sourcing and dating, AMS radiocarbon dating, and artifact analysis to answer these questions.    This project will contribute to broader goals of anthropological archaeology by providing a counterpoint to narratives of collapse associated with the Indian presence in the western United States and by examining the role of wilderness landscapes in structuring Native social identities.  It will also provide scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students, including under-privileged minority students, and involve descendant communities in scientific research.  The work will also address the logistical difficulties working in wilderness settings, the thickness of the forest floor cover, and the rapid and extensive looting following wildfires by exploring the use of innovative technologies to minimize destruction of archaeological remains and to mitigate the effects of vanishing resources.",Laura Scheiber|

An example of such a vaccine is a """"weakened"""" buffer-overflow exploit with its jump address scrambled: it causes an exception to a vulnerable program when attempting to hijack the program's control flow, from which a forensic analysis can uncover the underlying vulnerability.  The idea of vaccines offers an innovative avenue to address the grave threat posed by software security flaws, which has been fundamentally hampering the progress of the Internet.  This project develops vaccine techniques to protect vulnerable software in both reactive and proactive fashions. Reactive vaccines can quickly detect zero-day exploits and generate signatures without reliance on source or binary code. The project focuses on applying the technique to protect Internet services. Proactive vaccines are used for automatically discovering software vulnerabilities from the sources such as software patches and creating tentative remedies. This technique enables timely protection of vulnerable software even before the attacker can figure out an exploit.

Many of these vital infrastructures are geographically extensive; increasing vulnerability to disruption by natural disasters, accidents, and/or sabotage.  Planning for and managing the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to extreme events is a challenging task.  This is particularly true given the uncertainty associated with the timing and severity of these events and the network components involved.  Effective planning therefore is reliant on the ability to rigorously characterize potential disruptions.  This collaborative research project will develop several new approaches for assessing network vulnerability to interdiction, which is broadly defined as the debilitation of network elements due to disaster, accident, or intentional harm.  To support broader analysis of potential interdiction impacts to networked systems, the investigators will develop a general spatial optimization modeling framework for addressing the interdiction of system flow.  They also will refine and further develop the general framework to address a number of practical planning concerns.  Such concerns include additional planning objectives involving attributes of network components, interdiction cost, and system efficiency.  The ultimate aim of modeling interdiction impact is to better inform mitigation and remediation efforts.  A final goal of this research project will be the operationalization of a modeling framework to support system recovery in the event of interdiction.  This research will be rooted in theoretical developments applicable to any networked system, with the analytical framework being designed for cross-cutting use over a broad spectrum of infrastructures.    Understanding, assessing, and managing threats to critical network infrastructures is essential for ensuring the continuity of these complex systems.  To address these needs, this research project will advance work in geographic information science and network modeling to facilitate identification of infrastructure risks and vulnerabilities.  Modeling techniques developed to identify interdiction vulnerabilities will be useful for informing planning efforts and allocating resources for reducing risk in existing network infrastructure through fortification, recovery, and other such strategies.  The most significant implication of this research may be the ability to consider multiple planning goals in the analysis of network vulnerability within a unified interdiction modeling framework.  Such efforts will result in a more robust and realistic description of interdiction risk, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of recovery and fortification options.  The results of this research will be of interest to the scientific community as well as to governmental and private-sector agencies involved in planning for the continuity of critical infrastructures.",Tony Grubesic|

However, they have a limited understanding of the mechanisms that allow traits such as legs or wings to originate in first place. Dr. Armin Moczek is interested in understanding the genetic, developmental, and ecological mechanisms that are involved not just in the modification of preexisting traits, but in their actual origins. His research program is designed to uncover the genetic and developmental origins and subsequent evolutionary diversification of traits that are both novel and highly diverse: the horns of beetles. Many thousands of beetle species have evolved horns used as weapons in male competition over females, and a remarkable diversity of horn types exists. Preliminary results suggest that the origin of horns has been made possible by the use of a wide diversity of genes and developmental processes normally reserved for the development of appendages such as legs or mouthparts. The horns of beetles therefore offer an outstanding opportunity to study how nature reorganizes developmental and genetic processes in order to evolve a novel class of traits for new functions.

Ross and Ran Zhang    Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: This is My Right: Understanding Students Legal Consciousness through Due Process Protection in Chinese Universities    0719715    Abstract  	This study examines court documents, legal decisions, law and regulations relevant to students' due process rights, and survey and interview data from college students in four Chinese universities to explain the development of Chinese students' legal consciousness. The study will investigate what due process rights mean to Chinese students, how students' legal consciousness influences their legal and non-legal actions, and whether and to what extent this consciousness varies in relation to individual and institutional characteristics. The study's key proposition is that rights consciousness entails not only knowledge of legal rules, but also an awareness of the procedural and substantive values behind such rules and the capability to make situated ""rightful"" deliberation based on these rules and values. This proposition implies that an individual's claim of due process rights can be justified from three perspectives: provisions in statutes and regulations; internal pressure within the legal system to bring educational and other key sector laws into alignment; and the call of justice or broader legislative intent to protect individuals' rights and interests.    	Chinese students' rights are a neglected area of research in both education and law. This study will advance the two investigators' early work on students' rights in China, which represent the first set of inquiry in this area. This project will also fill an important and glaring gap in the larger scholarship on rights, citizenship, and resistance in China. Chinese intellectuals, home owners, and peasants have learned to leverage political opportunities within the state system to expand the boundaries of their rights.  This study will add significantly to this literature by illuminating the future significance to Chinese society of the development of students' rights consciousness during a critical transition to adulthood.   	This study also has practical implications for the expanding boundary of students' rights in China. Students' legal consciousness is important not only as a concept worthy of scholarly analysis, but also in its generative power as a catalyst for galvanizing disadvantaged or less powerful social groups to stand up, claim their rights, and affect social change.

This collaborative research project aims to better understand the conditions under which emotions felt toward other groups can exacerbate or reduce prejudice and discrimination.  Research has already shown that antipathy and intolerance between groups is often driven by specific emotions (such as anger and resentment, fear and anxiety, sympathy, or guilt) that are aroused when people encounter members of other groups.  The two sets of studies in this proposal focus on two important antecedents of specific emotions directed at other groups.  In the first set of studies changes in people's perceived group membership is examined.  The impact of these changes in categorization on emotions is assessed as well as the potential effects of an individual's emotional state on the categorization process itself.  The second set of studies examines personal contact with an individual member of another group as a way of understanding the specific emotions that contribute to a positive outcome, and how these emotions translate into overt behavior in encounters between groups.  Taken together, findings from this research will show how preconditions influence emotions which then translate into prejudice and behavior, and how this sequence might be altered or short-circuited. By showing when and how emotions toward other groups can exacerbate or reduce prejudice and discrimination, these research results may illuminate ways of reducing these important social problems.",Eliot Smith|

These computations can often be viewed as complex data flow graphs having components that are both data- and computationally- intensive, and requiring access to live data feeds and access to large-scale computational resources. A user may cycle through multiple graphs accessing data from sensors, instruments, databases, and large collections of files in the process of discovering new knowledge. This research investigates a programming model and framework for knowledge discovery in data-driven applications. Users program the system by declarative specification of detect-analyze-response behavior. Underlying the programming model is a continuous rule-based events processor and workflow orchestration engine organized as Web services. The research formalizes an abstract model of interaction and will map the higher-level conceptualization to the events processing and workflow runtime components. It demonstrates that the model supports a unique adaptive framework where knowledge gained from the computational and data analysis can be fed back to the data event streams. The approach is validated experimentally through quantifiable metrics and by its application to two model problems: severe storm prediction where a weather forecast is triggered based on data mining results from mining radar or model data, and adaptive resource management where hardware and software resources and environment data streams are monitored for on-the-fly resource requirements  prediction.",Beth Plale|

The transition between the two forms is relevant because it represents an early stage in biofilm formation and is a natural target for biofilm control. In the undomesticated Bacillus subtilis strain 3610, the DNA binding protein SinR governs the motility to biofilm transition by directly repressing the fifteen gene eps operon, which both directs the biosynthesis of a structural extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) and encodes EpsE, an inhibitor of motility.  This project will explore the regulation of biofilm formation, the mechanism of motility inhibition, and the structural basis of biofilm assembly.  Aim 1 studies the regulation of the eps operon.  Dr. Kearns has identified various genes which when mutated alter the expression of the eps operon and affect biofilm formation.  The genes and their corresponding products will be genetically and biochemically characterized to assemble a biofilm regulatory hierarchy relative to the SinR master regulator.  Aim 2 will explore the mechanism by which EpsE, a bifunctional putative glycosyltransferase, inhibits motility by acting as a brake on flagellar rotation.  This aim will not mechanistically explore how motility is inhibited during the transition to biofilms but also illuminate a new form of flagellar regulation.  Aim 3 will characterize the structure of the EPS that stabilizes B. subtilis biofilms. The sugar composition of purified EPS will be determined and genes within the eps operon will be mutated to evaluate their roles in EPS synthesis.    Intellectual Merit: For many bacteria, the transition from motility to EPS synthesis represents the earliest stage in biofilm formation and is a natural target for biofilm control. Dr. Kearns's project explores biofilm regulation in an undomesticated Gram positive organism that adds phylogenetic breadth to a field dominated by Gram-negative model systems. In addition, EpsE may represent a second example of a new class of bifunctional glycosyltransferases, the two functions of which directly couple EPS biosynthesis to motility inhibition. The first function of EpsE is to enzymatically synthesize the structural EPS required for biofilm assembly. The second function of EpsE is unrelated to its enzymatic activity and EpsE inhibits motility by acting as a molecular break on flagellar rotation. Combined, the two functions of EpsE ensure that cells become immobilized simultaneously with the activation of EPS biosynthesis. Bifunctional glycosyltransferases may be more common than people realize and may be responsible for the pleiotropic effects associated with biofilm formation in other bacterial systems. In addition, the discovery of a protein that acts as a brake on flagellar rotation constitutes a potentially important new form of motility regulation. Finally, the location of the gene encoding the EpsE glycosyltransferase is especially relevant to the motility-to-biofilm transition as it is encoded within the greater eps operon. Thus, the transition between motility and biofilm formation is governed at a single locus under the direct control of the master regulator, SinR.    Broader Impacts: This project impacts the robust B. subtilis community as new biology is explored in the context of an undomesticated strain. This project will also impact student training as the work is suitable for two or three graduate student dissertation projects. Furthermore, the genetic analyses will provide opportunities amenable to research participation by undergraduates. Indiana University has a number of programs in place to foster undergraduate research with particular emphasis on groups that are underrepresented in science. Preliminary data from this project was generated as part of an undergraduate research experience course designed by the PI. These protocols were successful at introducing undergraduates to molecular biological techniques and have already been implemented as an Advanced Molecular Genetics Laboratory (M485) at Indiana University.",Daniel Kearns|

Science gateways support scientific research communities and their outreach efforts. They consist of Web-based user and application programming interfaces that provide high-level access to Cyberinfrastructure middleware and translate middleware capabilities into scientific use cases. The OGCE works to provide these gateway development groups with the reusable software they need. OGCE portal software and component libraries currently provide client support for numerous Grid middleware tools, including the Globus Toolkit, Condor, MyProxy, and GPIR information services. The portal software is packaged and easily installable, allowing portal developers to build a functioning Grid portal in a single step. The current funding award will extend this work to provide several additional features as well as maintenance of the current software suite. Previous versions of the OGCE releases concentrated on client components for remote job and file management through a common, high-level Grid programming interface. In the project extension, the OGCE will build on this to address the information and metadata management needs of both scientists and gateway providers with the following tools: personal and resource metadata catalogs; enhanced system information tools, including access to batch queue prediction services; and gateway auditing, accounting, and logging libraries. The OGCE will also provide improved support for adding science applications to gateways. Efforts here will include computational experiment builder interfaces to workflow engines for end users, application factory services for application providers, and portlet XML tag libraries for portal developers. Finally, the OGCE identifies ?Web 2.0? approaches as potentially revolutionary to the gateway building process and will lead these developments within the gateway community.",Marlon Pierce|Nancy Wilkins-Diehr|Suresh Marru

PolarGrid consist of an intermittently disconnected field and base grids feeding information to ""lower 48"" data and computing resources. True real-time processing at the field camp is backed up with increasing fidelity, but increasing delay at the base and ""lower 48"" systems. The requested system includes an expedition grid consisting of ruggedized laptops in a field grid to a low power multi-core based camp cluster. A prototype and two production grids feed into a Teraflops system at Indiana and Elizabeth City State Universities. PolarGrid will be integrated with TeraGrid for both resource utilization and curricula sharing. Modern open data access standards will be followed so that raw processes, and simulated data can be archived outside PolarGrid by and for the science and engineering community. The innovative architecture of PolarGrid with intermittently disconnected components also has applications to other power- and bandwidth-challenged applications. The instrument responds to the recent polar satellite observations that show disintegration of ice shelves in Antarctica and the speed-up of several glaciers in Greenland.    Broader Impact: The infrastructure addresses an important current problem that touches all beings in one way or another, the key issue of polar ice disintegration.

This instrumentation will be utilized within multiple disciplines at the University where the collection of locationally-accurate field data is crucial to research objectives. The MSADPT instrumentation will make the latest and most accurate technology available to faculty and students in Anthropology, Archaeology, Geography, Geoscience, History, and Planning in support of research excellence, as well as provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to gain experience using the latest equipment and designing and implementing technology-based field projects. In addition, MSDAPT will be a mechanism to expand and strengthen inter-departmental and inter-college communication through collaborative teaching and research at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.     Social and physical science departments at American universities have begun to incorporate spatial analysis instruction in their curricula, and increasing numbers of students each year are being introduced to geographic information systems (GIS) and global positioning systems (GPS) technologies at campuses across the country. Our emphasis on GIS and GPS training will produce students in several disciplines who will be capable of creating and managing their own spatial research databases. Including this training in research-oriented courses will strengthen classroom instruction and make students competitive in the employment marketplace and well-versed for graduate studies. The ability of researchers to use GIS and GPS technologies to identify patterns, trends, and behaviors provides a valuable resource for many fields. Geographic information systems are spatial databases that are able to model the earth's surface in discrete layers that can represent any variable desired (natural phenomena, settlement sites, artifacts, land cover/land use, bodies of water, etc.). Global positioning systems equipment provides a mechanism to record the location of phenomena that is not accurately documented on existing maps, and therefore must be recorded in the field. The utilization of GIS and GPS in MSDAPT will allow IUP faculty and students to integrate field-collected data with increasingly comprehensive mapping datasets produced by federal, state and local governments within uniform recognized geographic coordinate systems. MSDAPT will enable complex spatial analysis of a variety of phenomena across social and physical science disciplines at IUP when implemented.    Indiana University of Pennsylvania is strongly committed to interdisciplinary research and teaching, and MSDAPT will continue and enhance this tradition. Faculty from four departments (Anthropology, Geography & Regional Planning, Geosciences, and History), and two colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences and Natural Sciences & Mathematics) will be contributing directly to the project. Institutionally, MSDAPT will provide new opportunities to document and analyze geographic and subsurface phenomena using methods that were not possible previously, improving university instruction, research productivity, educational outreach, and recruitment of new faculty.","Beverly Chiarulli|Jonathan Lewis|Francis Allard|Robert Moore|John Benhart, Jr."

Currently, LoCs are designed as application-specific chips, where a new LoC is designed for every assay by creating and connecting on-chip components to match the steps of the assay. (i.e., n assays need n LoC designs). Unfortunately, this application-specific approach (1) incurs considerable design effort, turn-around time, and cost for each assay and (2) reduces productivity because it requires LoC engineers to know the assay specifics and LoC users to know the constraints of the LoC.    To address these limitations, this project will design and prototype a general-purpose, programmable LoC (PLoC) which does not implement any specific assay and instead employs software to translate an assay into an equivalent ""executable"" which is run on the PLoC. The executable breaks down the assay into a sequence of basic steps called ""fluid instructions"", which are implemented in hardware. The set of fluid instructions implemented by a PLoC is called its ""fluid instruction set"", and any assay can be executed on the PLoC if the assay can be translated using the PLoC's fluid instruction set (i.e., n assays use 1 PLoC design instead of requiring n LoC designs). Compared to LoCs, the PLoC has significantly lower design effort and faster turn-around time due to one-time design of a single chip, and lower cost due to economy of volume. The clean separation between hardware and assay achieved by the fluid instruction set and the software translator (called ""the fluidic compiler"") vastly improves the productivity of LoC users and LoC engineers.",Stephen Jacobson|

This dissertation research builds on theories of segmented assimilation to study these aspects of incorporation among 1.5 and second generation children of Brazilian immigrants. Using both survey data collected on Brazilian households and 50 in-depth interviews with adult children of Brazilian immigrants, this project examines the ways in which documentation status and local community context affect the experiences of Brazilian immigrants, particularly their incorporation into American society. This research also contributes to sociological understandings of immigrant incorporation by extending the segmented assimilation approach not only to political incorporation, but also to the relationship between educational/occupational incorporation and political incorporation. Moreover, it speaks to more general theories of social stratification and higher education as it considers how documentation status acts as an axis of stratification, which unlike class and race, formally excludes individuals from society. More broadly, this research is important for policy makers as they discuss the rights of immigrants to higher education, financial aid to pay for such education, and pathways to citizenship for children of immigrants.",Leah VanWey|

The U.S. accounted for more than 50 percent of all intercountry adoptions worldwide in 2006.  Although policy-oriented approaches, focusing on issues of physical, mental, and emotional effects upon children and families dominate the literature, the study of cross-border family formation as an outcome of globalization and uneven development has not yet been fully theorized.  This doctoral dissertation research project uses qualitative social science methods to study both global processes and local conditions sustaining the practice of intercountry adoption between the Philippines and the United States.  The doctoral candidate will employ world systems, globalization, migration, and network theories as frameworks for analysis.  Conditions and perspectives in both the sending and receiving regions will be analyzed to better understand the structural, temporal, and place-specific factors that have brought about a systematic and persistent migration of children from the Philippines to the United States in the post-World War II era.  Through a series of semi-structured and in-depth interviews with U.S. embassy officials, orphanage directors and staff, foster families, staff at non-governmental organizations, representatives of local government agencies, and adoption attorneys, the student will examine the significant factors that explain intercounty adoptions from the perspective of a major source country.  The study also will examine patterns of ethnicity, native language, age, economic and social conditions, and home region of recently adopted children to better understand the local conditions surrounding internationally adopted children in the Philippines.  These data, in combination with interview, survey, and published data on the corresponding set of stakeholders (adoptive parents, adoption agency staff, and adoption attorneys) in the United States, will facilitate further understanding of the structural, historical, political, ecological, demographic, and economic conditions associated with this contemporary form of cross-border family formation.  The results of this study will help illuminate the complex contradictions of power at play in both the sending and receiving regions of this tenuous migration stream.    This study will evaluate an important topic from a variety of theoretical vantage points to increase understanding about how the process of intercountry adoption operates at multiple geographical scales (global, local, and intermediary).  In addition, the study will provide valuable insight on a matter that directly influences human lives and livelihoods.  Findings will inform public agencies, non-profits, individuals, and the governments of both the Philippines and the United States at a crucial time when international policy is undergoing significant changes as a result of greater public awareness and the emergence of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption.  While the contemporary popular discourse on intercountry adoption in the U.S. has focused largely upon the needs of adopting parents and families, this study will examine societal concerns at both the sending and receiving end of the migration stream.  Previous studies in anthropology, medicine, and social work have targeted China, Korea, Romania, and Russia as sources because these countries have provided large numbers of children for adoption in the United States in particular years.  The Philippines, however, has not been studied in the same context, presumably because it represents fewer annual adoptions than the aforementioned places.  Over the course of the past fifteen years, however, the Philippines stands as the fifth largest provider of internationally adopted children in the United States.  This study will inform the literature on migration, development, and globalization while simultaneously informing public policy on an important emerging topic.

He will observe implantation of the NeuroPace Responsive Neurostimulator and subdural grid electrodes in patients and gain experience in the visual analysis and interpretation of the EEG data. He will then apply wavelet-based and other signal processing techniques to analyze the EEG signals in order to obtain additional information that cannot be discerned from a visual reading of the EEGs. He will also attend the weekly presurgical meetings with Drs. Worth and Salanova and medical residents on case studies of seizure EEGs. These interactions in a clinical environment will strengthen and reinforce the PI's understanding of EEG data analysis. In Dr. Kubek's laboratory, the PI will work on the kindled rat seizure model and perform wavelet analysis of the recorded EEG signals. He will work closely with an MD-PhD student on various aspects of the kindling experiments including EEG data acquisition and microarray gene expression techniques. The PI will spend the summer of 2008 with Dr. Schiff in his laboratory at the Center for Neural Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. There he will work on computational aspects of the development of brain-computer interfaces for controlling seizures in rodent epilepsy models and epileptic patients.    The experience gained from this project will enable the PI to develop his research in the area of computational neuroscience. He will be in a unique position to interact and collaborate with neurophysiologists, neurologists and other biomedical scientists and apply his knowledge and skills of signal processing techniques to medically important problems of epilepsy and seizure.",Asok Sen|William Bosron

Why should some bacterial species adopt such diverse shapes as a bedspring coil, a star or a partly eaten donut?  No one really knows.  However, the precise reproduction and evolutionary conservation of these shapes indicate that they play an important role in the life of bacteria.  Despite recent progress in understanding the mechanisms that control cell shape determination, or morphogenesis, we still do not understand how bacterial cells generate specific shapes, or what the function of bacterial morphological changes is.  This project will focus on a group of bacteria, the prosthecate or stalked bacteria, that provides a well-defined and simple example of morphological change, whose study will reveal basic principles that apply to other cell shape changes.  Stalked bacteria synthesize one or more thin extensions of their cell envelope, the prosthecae or stalk, that act as sort of antennae that amplify their ability to take up nutrients from their environment.  The narrow stalk adds little volume to the cell, and incoming nutrients diffuse toward the cell's main body, where nutrients are quickly assimilated by metabolic processes.  The goal of this project is to produce a high quality draft sequence of nine genomes of prosthecate bacteria, and one closely related non-prosthecate bacterium, selected to represent an increasingly complex collection of morphologies.  The genomes will be analyzed with respect to mechanisms for the biosynthesis and function of stalks, the extent of conservation of regulatory pathways for stalk biosynthesis, and the interesting and potentially useful physiological properties of these organisms.  Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of the stalked bacteria will further the understanding of the mechanisms of stalk synthesis.  The results will provide the information necessary to engineer stalked bacteria with new metabolic pathways, or to engineer other bacteria to synthesize stalks.  	The genomic sequence information obtained in this study will aid the research of many investigators who study the cell biology, developmental biology, and cell shape determination and function of bacteria.  Stalked bacteria are ubiquitous inhabitants of aquatic environments and thrive under low nutrient (oligotrophic) conditions.  Therefore, this study will provide insight into the physiology of oligotrophs in general.  Since stalks take up diffuse compounds from water sources, this feature could be exploited for bioremediation, specifically the uptake of toxic compounds from contaminated water sources.  By engineering the bacteria used in bioremediation to make stalks, their ability to take up pollutants and their efficiency can be improved.  The stalked bacteria to be sequenced are physiologically diverse, including both anoxygenic and aerobic bacteria.  It should be possible to design specific genera of stalked bacteria to combat contamination in specific environments, either by exploiting their metabolic pathways, or by engineering them with metabolic pathways from other organisms.  Furthermore, extracellular polysaccharides from some of the stalked bacteria sequester metals, a feature that could be used to remediate environments affected by metal toxicity.  The knowledge acquired in this project could also have uses in industry.  Bacteria are often used as workhorses in the mass-conversion of one molecule to another.  For example, improving the speed of uptake of a substrate molecule by these bacteria, by engineering them to synthesize stalks, should improve drug production.  Of ecological significance, bacteria with stalks are ubiquitous in all the earth's aquatic environments, and stalks have been shown to improve the uptake of phosphorus.  Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient in determining the productivity of lakes and oceans.  The stalked bacteria are central players in scavenging phosphorus in oceans and lakes, and reintroducing it into the food chain.  Finally, this project will also provide training opportunities in genomics.  Students and postdoctoral fellows involved in this and other projects in the PI's laboratory will have the opportunity to mentor less experienced students under the supervision of the PI.  Students involved in the PI's research, including undergraduate students, will be exposed to modern methods of genomic analysis and their use to engineer bacteria for applications in industry and bioremediation.  Finally, inquiry-based modules based on this research will be developed for use in undergraduate microbiology laboratory courses.",Yves Brun|Sun Kim

Further, it seeks to apply these findings to the assessment and evaluation of these teaching methods.   Intellectual Merit.  A better understanding of the impact of ITMs is of paramount importance for improving the ITM methodology. In order to develop activities, and to intervene most effectively, instructors must know the structure and processes in the mind of the learner.  Moreover, the research undertaken in this project is advancing the knowledge of how students learn chemistry in general. The framework for the study is the concept of a mental model as proposed by Lesh and coworkers in 2000. The research project is designed as a cross-case study with comparison and contrast between cases, with the goal of finding the common constituents of the mental model. The method is single participant interviews. The data collection techniques are think aloud protocols and thought revealing activities.  Four general concept areas in chemistry, equilibrium, periodic trends, atomic and molecular structure, and chemical kinetics, are being studied.  These areas represent important fundamental concepts that chemistry students build on throughout their study of chemistry. Further, the project looks at how some common educational tools influence the development of students' mental models in these concept areas.   Broader Impacts. The understanding of student mental models is being integrated into an action research model aimed at improving inductive teaching methodologies. Mental model construction provides information about the structure and processes of learning. A prerequisite for learning is the construction of the constituents of a mental model, so identifying the existence of the constituents of a mental model of a chemical concept is a valid assessment of the efficacy of an ITM.  Since a mental model is not just recall of, or familiarization with, chemical concepts, but is a thinking tool that is later applied to unfamiliar domain specific problems, an effective ITM can scaffold the construction of a mental model that can be applied to problems common to the particular domain. Effective and detailed assessment and evaluation of ITMs using the framework of mental models allows for improvements both in the development of materials, and in the educational techniques used during the activity. Successful development of such assessment methods is expected to have a far reaching impact, since they provide a generalized scheme for developing and evaluating ITMs at the conceptual level.",George Long|Michael Briggs

Two contrasting hypotheses have been proposed for surface sediments in lower Taylor Valley, which have important and very different implications for how the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) responded to the sea-level rise of the last deglaciation and Holocene environmental changes. One hypothesis holds that the sediments, designated Ross I drift, directly reflect >10,000 14C-years of WAIS shrinkage in the Ross Sea during and perhaps driven by deglacial sea-level rise. The other hypothesis, holds that the Taylor sediments have little significance for WAIS change during the deglaciation.  These two hypotheses reflect fundamentally different interpretations of the sediment record. Over the course of two field seasons and a third year at the home institutions, the project will test these two hypotheses using glacial geology, geochemistry, ground penetrating radar (GPR) at both 100 MHz and 400 MHz, and portable sediment coring. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that it will test these two hypotheses and make novel use of the subsurface record that may result in new insights into WAIS sensitivity during the deglaciation. The study will also directly test the conclusion that Glacial Lake Washburn was much larger than previously proposed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This occurrence, if real, represents a stunning climate anomaly. Answers to these local ice sheet and lake questions directly pertain to larger scale issues concerning the influences of sea-level rise, climate change, and internal ice-sheet dynamics on the recession of the WAIS since the LGM. There are numerous broader impacts to this project.  Understanding the glacial and lake history in the McMurdo Sound region has important implications for the role that the WAIS will play in future sea-level and global climate change. Moreover, the history of Taylor Valley has significance for the ecosystem studies currently being conducted by the LTER group. Lastly, during the course of the proposed research, the project will train two graduate and undergraduate students and the research will be featured prominently in the teaching of students.",Michael Prentice|

They also need a tool that lets them analyze and mine terabytes of relevant data and presents aggregated results in an easy to understand way, enabling them to increase the quality of their decisions. However, more than just a tool is needed. The design of tools that truly support science policy making requires a detailed characterization and prioritization of the information needs of science policy makers, along with a conceptual framework that links the information needs of the policy maker to the available data, analysis and indicator types. Once these are in place, tool development that truly addresses the needs of today's science policy makers given the constraints of existing datasets as well as theoretical and algorithmic approaches can proceed.   This study addresses three challenges.  First, a detailed analysis is conducted of the information needs of a representative set of science policy makers including existing data, approaches and tools.  Second, a theoretic conceptualization is developed of tasks relevant to science policymaking that maps the needs of policy makers to theoretically grounded and practically valuable processing pipelines that transform data into actionable information. This conceptualization is then made available online in a wiki-like format for community review and consensus building.  Third, a prototypical tool--a macroscope--is designed to visualize structure, patterns, trends, and outliers in science and technology data sets that are too large and complex to be comprehensible to the researchers through direct observation--just like microscopes and telescopes make it possible to see things that are too small or too far away. The prototypical macroscope supports a well defined set of information needs, e.g., identification of emerging research frontiers or correlation of funding with publications and patents in an area of research and exploration of results using graphs and geospatial and science maps. Macroscope tool development will benefit from the NSF funded Scholarly Database (SDB)) that provides access to more than 20 million scholarly records, and the Cyberinfrastructure Shell (CIShell), which supports the easy plug and play of datasets and algorithms and the design of stand-alone tools. Usability studies are conducted to evaluate and optimize the macroscope. The macroscope as well as its support of advanced science mapping techniques will be introduced to a broader audience by means of the Places and Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit.  Researchers and science policymakers in Japan will participate in this project, generating a bi-directional flow of best theory and practice.  The scientific study and management of science and technology requires a shared terminology and conceptualization of how science works. It requires shared data repositories that can be used to run benchmarks and comparisons of algorithms, to thoroughly validate the combination of algorithms, indicators, and evaluation procedures. The theoretical component of this study, as well as the extension of the SDB and the prototypical design of a macroscope, will create a basic shared understanding and a freely available cyberinfrastructure and tool for the science of science (policy) community.   The same capabilities that could make the macroscope a tool of choice for science policy makers could also make it attractive to other potential users. For instance, students or members of the public will be able to see the large scale structures of science, and find potential areas of interest for further study; researchers will be able to monitor and access research results, relevant funding opportunities, or find potential collaborators within and without their fields of inquiry. Program managers and reviewers will use it to meet their individual needs.",Katy Borner|Kevin Boyack|Weixia Huang

Cognitive models developed by the Fluid Analogies Research Group (FARG) at the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition (CRCC) in the past three decades have provided new insight into a wide variety of creative tasks such as solving analogy problems, extrapolating number sequences, and designing typefaces. The domain of music provides an opportunity to extend these techniques for the study of fundamental mechanisms of cognition and creativity. Specifically, the proposed research aims to develop a novel model of music cognition that simulates the creative processes involved in music ? not, however, in the composition or improvisation of music, but in the seemingly much simpler and more common act of music perception. How is music perception creative? Perception is an active process where the brain interprets sensory inputs, and transforms the raw input into a compressed format. Far from being a passive, robotic algorithm, this process of interpretation is quite dynamic and influenced by cognitive context. Such perception is not only subjective, but creative, as evidenced by its generation of novel internal representations of sensory data. A central tenet of the philosophy underlying this work is that the exact same processes that drive the creative perception of sensory input also give rise to the high-level generation of creative thoughts, ideas, and works of art.",Douglas Hofstadter|

Data will be collected from the ongoing Taiwan and early Paleozoic Taconic collisional orogenic belts because of the opportunities afforded by modern and ancient orogens for understanding kinematics at lower upper-crustal levels.  Short-term brittle deformation will be characterized in the region of the partially subducted fracture zone in Taiwan from brittle faults and earthquake focal mechanisms through the application of micropolar continuum theory to invert for strain.  Long-term ductile deformation resulting from the reactivation of continental margin fracture zones will be quantified through finite and incremental strain analysis of slates exposed in the Taconic allochthon of Vermont and New York.  Kinematic and mechanical modeling will be undertaken to integrate the results obtained from the two orogenic belts.  In addition to testing the viability of kinematic models, the mechanical modeling will be used to put limits on the boundary conditions and rock rheology.    Although the high topography of mountain chains develops on the overriding tectonic plate at collisional zones, the geometry of the downgoing tectonic plate can exert a fundamental control on the pattern of deformation within and uplift history of mountainous regions.  Fracture zones, which form during precollisional rifting and lie at a high angle to the continental margin, are a general feature of downgoing continental crust.  Their reactivation during collision is expected to produce complex, three-dimensional deformation.  This project, therefore, will contribute to ongoing research in the field aimed at (1) describing how crustal-scale heterogeneities result in strain partitioning in both the horizontal and vertical directions in a deforming body of rock and (2) fully characterizing the three-dimensional nature of deformation of Earth?s crust.  Moreover, the integration of results from modern and ancient collisional zones will enable the development of a global model to aid in the interpretation of other ancient collisions.  Ultimately, this project will advance understanding of the factors influencing the topographic development of mountain chains and the distribution of earthquakes within them.",Jonathan Lewis|

Raphael  Indiana University      ABSTRACT    Music exists on several levels. One view is in terms of the directly observable attributes of a musical score, such as notes and rhythms written in traditional symbolic music notation by a composer. Another view is in terms of the audio stream corresponding to an expressive rendering of the score. Between these two extremes--the atomic sub-components and an expressive performance--there are many levels. Only some of these have well-developed representations and analyses. The goal of this project is to develop a representation of an intermediate layer that can explain the association between the lowest note level and the top expressive level and to develop a system for expressive rendering of continuously controlled music that will begin with melody represented as a note list with an analysis of the harmonic structure and produce an expressive audio corresponding to a performance of it. To achieve this goal, the project aims to develop a representation for capturing the expressive elements of the notes--their prosodic function--for instance, their implicit musical direction and stress. The project will also study the relationship between this mid-level representation and continuous audio in an actual rendition of the music. For this aspect, the project will employ a """"Theramin"""" model for audio that continuously modulates the pitch and amplitude of a sinusoidal tone. Such a model is capable of representing a variety of expressive musical elements including dynamics and vibrato.    This project will pursue the following specific tasks: (1) development of a small corpus of expression-annotated music; (2) development of a system for automatically computing the prosodic annotation from the symbolic melody and harmony representations; and (3) development of a system for automatically generating the Theramin representations from prosodically annotated melody and harmony. The use of machine learning methods will be employed in this project to predict Theramin representations that resemble those of a training corpus; these will also be used in evaluation.",Christopher Raphael|

The main common feature of all these problems resides in their multi-linear nature. Of particular  Interest, when dealing with a multi-linear operator acting on some product of Lebesgue spaces, is to understand the range of indices for which it is well behaved. In this proposal the focus is mainly on almost everywhere convergence, and thus inherently on the boundedness of the associated  maximal operators. An important instance of multi-linearity is represented by the combinatorial averages such as Furstenberg's nonstandard averages and the averages on cubes. The convergence of such averages has deep implications for various Ramsey-type problems on integers and even on general abstract groups. A second type of multi-linear operators we plan to investigate is represented by the weighted averages and series, such as the ones appearing in the so-called ``return times theorems''. The analysis of these objects reveals striking connections between dynamics and time-frequency analysis, in particular between Birghoff's point-wise ergodic theorem and Carleson's result on the point-wise convergence of Fourier series.      This proposed research is at the cutting edge of what is now being done in dynamical systems, harmonic analysis and arithmetic combinatorics. It is expected that the resolution of the questions advanced in this proposal will further the mathematical community's understanding of the connections between these areas, in particular between processes in harmonic analysis and their analogue in ergodic theory. The nature of this research makes it also likely for our investigation to shed yet more light on some of the tools that are used in other areas of science, such as signal processing. The research project that is proposed in this grant will lead to interactions between the PI and  mathematicians from other universities with whom part of the investigation might be conducted.",Ciprian Demeter|

Denitrification removes reactive nitrogen from aquatic ecosystems and has important implications for water quality.  Quantifying the factors that control denitrification rates in streams, and their spatial and temporal variability, has long been a challenge.  The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which patterns in denitrification can be explained by the genetic structure of bacterial communities and the interactions between bacteria and other environmental factors, such as the chemistry of dissolved organic matter.  This project will be conducted in an agricultural landscape in the midwestern U.S. where nitrogen pollution is a pressing concern.  The study will combine modern molecular biology with recent advances in use of isotopic tracers to measure in-stream denitrification rates.  	Nitrogen enrichment of aquatic ecosystems is a persistent environmental problem, particularly in agricultural areas.  However, current understanding of nitrogen cycling in streams and rivers is based largely on studies in watersheds with low levels of nitrogen pollution.  By focusing on a nitrogen-rich agricultural landscape, this study will expand understanding of nitrogen cycling in human-dominated ecosystems.  This project will advance scientific understanding of how bacterial communities interact with the environment to produce an important ecosystem function (denitrification).  It will also contribute to a growing body of knowledge addressing the question of how ecosystem function is related to biodiversity, and promote interdisciplinary graduate research training and undergraduate education.",Todd Royer|Laura Leff

SCC is executed by a protein complex called Cohesin, and is essential for bi-allelic attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle.  In the absence of cohesin or the proteins required for its proper assembly on chromosomes (collectively referred to as cohesion establishment factors or CEFs), chromosome mis-segregation may occur, resulting in aneuploidy, a hallmark of many genetic disorders including cancer.  Knowledge at the molecular level of how SCC is executed by CEFs will not only shed light on a vital cellular mechanism to avert chromosome mis-segregation, but may also reveal critical targets of genome surveillance pathways which function to prevent mitotic progression in the presence of defective chromosomes.  Although current models propose that CEFs function to coordinate DNA replication with cohesion establishment, the mechanism by which the process is executed, and the precise role of each CEF is unclear.  The focus of this project is on elucidating the role of the CEF Ctf18-RFC, which shares activities similar to the DNA replisome component RFC.  A requirement for the RFC-like activities of Ctf18-RFC for SCC will be investigated by defining the domains of Ctf18-RFC required for its RFC-like function in vitro, and then correlating loss of its RFC-like function with impaired SCC in vivo.     The very basic aspect of genetic inheritance addressed by this project is also the vehicle for our K-12 and undergraduate science education goals, which seek to broaden the base and depth of scientific knowledge acquired by students, and increase the number of students who choose careers in basic science research.",Viola Ellison|

Containing an electron donor-acceptor pair separated by a spacer, the dyes are based on the electric-field dependence of electron transfer, which competes with fluorescence emission and converts changes in electric fields to changes in fluorescence intensity. This type of dyes is unique in that their fluorescence intensity has wavelength-independent voltage response, and therefore all their emitted photons may be collected for voltage detection. This is in sharp contrast to existing voltage-sensitive dyes in which only a small portion of emitted photons are useful, and may therefore lead to photon counts hundreds of times larger and improve signal-to-noise ratio in measurements by more than one order of magnitude. Guided by both theoretical calculations and optical characterization, the aim is to synthesize dyes with sub-microsecond time response, high voltage sensitivity, and large fluorescence quantum yield, so that they can facilitate multi-site optical tracking of neuronal activity with sub-millisecond time resolution and sub-micrometer spatial resolution. Furthermore, based on this general voltage-sensing mechanism, more novel optical voltage probes can be developed, such as two-photon-absorbing voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes that would allow for three-dimensional brain imaging and probes based on fluorescent proteins.",Liang-shi Li|

For plus-strand RNA viruses the temporal regulation of gene expression and genome replication occurs through the action of the viral ribonuclear protein complex (vRNP). The vRNP is assembled around viral RNA and its composition is defined by the recruitment of proteins, both viral and host, to specific RNA elements. Differential availability of proteins and viral RNA elements at particular times during the virus replication cycle can therefore alter the composition of the vRNP and change the function of the complex. Identifying RNA elements required for specific macromolecular synthetic events and the proteins that bind them to form a vRNP are fundamental requirements if we are to understand the regulatory processes necessary for virus replication.    This project seeks to understand the regulation of gene expression and genome replication of plus-strand RNA viruses using Sindbis virus (SIN), the type species of the alphavirus genus. During SIN replication the genome is translated giving rise to the non-structural polyprotein. A semi-processed form of this protein is required for the copying (minus-strand synthesis) of the genome from which it was translated. In turn the minus-strand RNA serves as a template for production of progeny genomes, and a subgenomic mRNA synthesized by a complex containing the fully processed non-structural proteins. It is therefore apparent that different vRNP complexes perform each of these processes. The project aims to elucidate the molecular interactions that mediate the transitions in vRNP composition and function     These studies will significantly impact the understanding of the molecular mechanisms required for alphavirus replication. Additionally, as plus-strand RNA viruses are united by a common scheme of replication, principles established from these studies will be of more general interest and importance for the study of all plus-strand RNA viruses. The project will provide a forum for the training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows.

This project will seek to expand and refine our understanding of the long-term transformations, contextual influence, and epistemic and epistemological dimensions of experimentation by studying significant direct connections between key experimenters in physiology and chemistry of the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. In its focus on several clear threads of historical connection, this project has multiple aims and rewards: to study a neglected major seventeenth-century research program; highlight the crucial role that experiments on living entities played in the seventeenth century; trace a vital tradition stretching to the nineteenth century; and develop a comparative approach in which the various periods mutually illuminate features of change and continuity in practices, ideas, attitudes, and materials involved in the production of experimental knowledge.    While current literature focuses largely on the socio-cultural context of experimental science, we still lack more detailed studies of the production of knowledge in experiments. The important connection of nineteenth-century physiology to the seventeenth century has not been explored. The present project would build on the growing awareness of Dutch experimentation by addressing under-researched figures such as Regnier de Graaf (1641-1673), Franciscus dele Boe Sylvius (1614-1672), and Florentius Schuyl (1619-1669). In the nineteenth century, leading scientists Francois Magendie (1783-1855) and Claude Bernard (1813-1878) revived and re-envisioned the work of the seventeenth-century researchers in their own experiments and attitudes toward the laboratory investigation of life.    The intellectual merit of this project is found both in the historical recovery of key themes and figures, the vital analysis of organic experimentation, and the novel historiographical approach. Taking the experiments on the pancreas and the body as a chemical apparatus as a focus, this project will provide a mix of detailed comparison of anatomical practices, philosophical veins, bodily sensation, standards of chemical analysis, and broadly experimental approaches, all within the cultural contexts of their times. In building an analysis of multiple perspectives on scientific and historical entities, this project will refine a novel approach to the history of science that takes a robust view of experiments and experimental practices and objects as historical subjects, but remains sensitive to local context and culture.    The broader impacts of such a study are manifold. Such a project will illuminate changing relations between concepts of nature, art, and the body, and how these concepts relate to experimentation, as well as expand our historical understanding of the ethics and experiences of animal experimentation, and add to the study of technology, instrumentation, and the historical transmission of texts and images. As a scientific, cultural, and social phenomenon, physiological experimentation in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries also necessitates interrelations with other fields o studies: studies of the body in gender studies, the notion of life and the soul in philosophy and theology, the transmission of knowledge in materials in the history of the book, social governance and statecraft, and the history of practices and material culture all meet in the heart of the experimental enterprise.",Domenico Meli|

A main goal is to prove that various stratified spaces whose closure posets are thin and shellable are in fact regular CW complexes.  She also aims to construct boundary maps on important classes of posets such as geometric lattices, motivated by potential applications e.g. in theoretical computer science.  She will also study representations of simple Lie algebras via an analysis of local structure within the poset that indicates which weight space generators appear with nonzero coefficient upon application of a raising or lowering operator to other weight space generators.    In computer science, there is a strong interest both in finding effective algorithms when this is possible, and also in understanding when this is not theoretically possible.  It is often difficult to know how to even begin to obtain these impossibility results, but topology combined with combinatorics does have the potential to yield such results, and there have been some striking successes in the past.  One of the proposed projects is somewhat in this vein -- to prove impossibility results for the question of which graphs (i.e. which models for networks of computers) admit data sorting algorithms by greedily swapping pieces of neighboring data that are out of order.  In another direction, geometric structures such as the Schubert varieties of representation theory/algebraic geometry often have combinatorial data associated to them which is organized into what is called a partially ordered set.  Much is known about how properties of the geometric structure force properties on the partially ordered set.  The PI seeks a better understanding of how much can be said in the other direction, perhaps allowing some manageable extra data such as information about how edges are attached to 2-dimensional faces, how 2-dimensional faces are attached to 3-dimensional faces, and so on.  This could have applications to finding new ways of figuring out what very complicated, high-dimensional geometric objects look like.  In addition to continuing to mentor students and run seminars, the PI will also continue organizing conferences designed to foster fruitful new interactions and collaborations between those working in topological combinatorics and in related areas such as combinatorial representation theory and combinatorial commutative algebra.",Patricia Hersh|

(b) Why did the Big Bang leave the universe with the surplus of matter over anti-matter that we see today?  Using a connection derived theoretically by the famous Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov, we will address this question by looking for interactions in Nature which change upon reversal of the direction of time (c) Do neutrinos, the lightest and most weakly interacting massive particles known in nature, behave strangely at low energy?  We will use a special beam constructed at Fermilab to check. (d) How strong is the weak force inside and between neutrons and protons?

These systems are closely related mathematically, all sharing common features with the Navier-Stokes equations of multidimensional, compressible fluid flow and arise in a variety of applications, including the flow of compressible fluids and gases, shallow-water theory, magnetohydrodynamics, and the modeling of self-gravitating stellar systems. The primary goal of the project is to achieve precise, mathematically certain statements about these models by applying techniques from the fields of analysis and partial differential equations. This research seeks to impact the underlying physical science by validating the models, setting limits on the range of applicability of the models, or in some cases even invalidating the models under consideration. At the intellectual level it applies a reasoning process quite distinct from that in which laboratory data is compared with predictions based on numerical simulations. Indeed, the mathematical mechanisms which insure well-posedness of realistic models nearly always have physical counterparts; this means that the challenge to analyze these models with strict mathematical rigor is also a challenge to understand the physical phenomena at a newer, deeper level. Additionally, by identifying the correct framework in which a mathematical model is well-posed and the mathematical mechanisms which make it so, this research can point the way to the effective design of methods for generating approximate solutions by computer simulation.     This project will address various mathematical questions relating to important physical models of compressible fluids and materials. These models arise in a broad range of applications, including supersonic flight, dynamic meteorology, combustion processes, and stellar dynamics. While the main goal in constructing these models is to achieve a predictive capability, the systems of equations which comprise them are far too complicated to be ""solved"" in any explicit sense. On the other hand, adequate approximate solutions can frequently be generated by computer methods. The intelligent and effective design of such methods depends crucially, however, on a rigorous understanding of why solutions do exist, in what sense they exist, and in what ways they are sensitive to noise in the data. The project will therefore seek to provide this rigorous mathematical framework for these models and to determine possible limits on the range of their applicability. A second goal of the project will be to attract and nurture the development of younger mathematicians to this area of research. Specifically, the PI will continue collaborative research with present and future graduate students and postdocs, will teach an advanced graduate-level course on mathematical problems in compressible flow in the second year of the grant period, and will continue supervising undergraduate research in Indiana University's REU program approximately every third summer.",David Hoff|

The conferences will be short, held over a weekend, and typically include around six invited lectures. These lectures will generally reflect the interests and research plans of symplectic topologists, and their collaborators, in Illinois and Indiana. In particular, lecture topics will include, but not be limited to, the following branches of symplectic topology: the theory of holomorphic curves and Gromov-Witten theory; Floer homology and Fukaya categories; the theory of Leftschetz fibrations; three-dimensional contact topology; contact homology and symplectic field theory; dynamics of Hamiltonian flows; applications to low dimensional topology via Seiberg-Witten and Heegard-Floer theory. The meetings will become centers of discussion and research communication in the region.    Over the past twenty years symplectic topology has evolved from an undoubtedly fundamental yet prohibitively intractable field into one of the most popular and exciting areas of mathematical research, producing a constant stream of deeply original and inspiring results. Its origins lie in classical and quantum mechanics but the subject is now closely tied to many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, not least complex analysis, smooth topology, partial differential equations and mirror symmetry.This development has been recognized by major math departments which have recruited symplectic topologists. Now even relatively small geographical areas, such as the regions of Illinois and Indiana to the south and east of Chicago, are home to several healthy groups of researchers. This proposal exploits this circumstance with a regular conference. The meetings will bring together active researchers, graduate students and interested people from other disciplines for a weekend of discussion and collaboration centered around lectures from invited leaders in the field. The project will foster interaction amongst symplectic geometers in the region and stimulate new ideas and research.",Olguta Buse|

Because sensor nodes are battery-powered, the most critical challenge in WSNs is minimizing the use of power, of which the most energy-consuming operation is data transmission. Given the commonly high correlations of sensed data in time and space, an analytical framework for correlation studies and new data gathering protocols is fundamentally important to reduce communication costs through lossless data compression in WSNs. This project is devoted to the fundamental investigation of exploiting temporal correlation In WSNs, for sustaining monitoring in harsh and possibly hostile environments, through an integrated theoretical and empirical approach. From this project, a novel, analytical, adaptive multimodal predictive transmission framework based on predictive coding is developed, for environmental monitoring WSN engineering, to achieve substantial energy savings and, hence, to significantly extend the lifetime of WSNs. Based on the developed framework, a new data gathering protocol suite is designed and implemented. Furthermore, a real-world environmental monitoring WSN testbed in a hilly watershed is deployed for evaluation and validation. Our interdisciplinary education plan uses the built WSN testbed and integrates our research results and new insights into education practice to provide hands-on training and experience for undergraduate and graduate students in both environmental and IT fields.",Yao Liang|

In a different direction the proposer intends to investigate how far Galois representations can be used to solve the inverse Galois problem for groups of Lie type over the field of rational numbers.  Other goals of the proposal include studying the geometry of quotients of finite group actions in order to investigate Galois module structure on abelian varieties and analyzing the asymptotic invariant-theory of groups which need not be reductive, with an eye to computing monodromy groups.    In general terms, the proposer intends to investigate the interplay of ideas in group theory (the abstract study of symmetry), algebraic number theory (the study of systems of numbers satisfying polynomial equations with rational coefficients), and algebraic geometry (the geometric study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables).

More specifically, using work of Fisher and Stephenson as its starting point, it studies how the total number of dimer coverings of the complement of the holes changes as the holes are shifted around on the lattice graph. The joint correlation of a collection of holes is a non-negative real number measuring this change, and is the central object of study of this proposal. In earlier work, the proposer proved that the correlation of holes on the hexagonal lattice is governed, for large separations between the holes, by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics: If each hole is regarded as a point charge of magnitude given by the signed difference between the number of white and black vertices in it (in a fixed white-black coloring of the vertices in which each edge has oppositely colored endpoints), then, for large distances between the holes, their correlation is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the 2D electrostatic energy of the resulting system of charges. Other previous results concern two naturally defined fields that the proposer proved approach the electric field in the limit when the lattice spacing approaches zero. In the current project, the proposer presents a program organized in several inter-related groups comprising two dozen specific problems and conjectures. The bulk of this program is aimed at developing further the analogy to electrostatics, but the list includes also independent combinatorial problems, such as conjectures on tiling enumeration of new regions and problems arising in the study of card shufflings.    This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant to the study of of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid, consisting of two-atom molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (speciffically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly turns out to allow progress in the asymptotic study.",Mihai Ciucu|

The latter is expected to provide quantitative information of interest to physical practitioners in shock and detonation theory. A larger goal is to move beyond simple stability analysis to the study of nontrivial dynamics including bifurcation, interaction, and behavior of complex flows. The project involves interesting and nonstandard issues in singular perturbation theory, dynamical systems and bifurcation, spectral theory of linear operators, and nonlinear partial differential equations, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. The plan of attack centers around Evans function and related spectral techniques developed recently by the investigator and various collaborators.    The stability of regular flow patterns is an old and central topic in fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics, deciding which (stable) patterns will typically be observed, and which  unstable) are only mathematical and not physically observable solutions.  The transition from stability to instability is of particular importance, since it usually signals the appearance of alternative, more complicated flow patterns close to the original (now unstable) one- this is a way to understand complicated flows by the study of simpler and better-understood ones.  Our goal is to move existing theory from the qualitative to the quantitative regime, obtaining new information of use to practitioners at the same time that we advance the mathematical theory.  The planned activities  expected to strengthen and extend existing networks of cooperation across field, and to aid in training of graduate and postdoctoral students.

It is thought that economic and socio-demographic factors have played critical roles in structuring these changes; in particular, household decisionmaking, driven by environmental factors, government policies, and knowledge of land use and water quality are important components driving land and water use choices in small watersheds. These uses have specific outcomes for the water quality found in streams draining small watersheds, particularly the quantity and type of nutrients that are important for the biological productivity of stream ecosystems. As a result, this study evaluates the role of household needs and activities, land and water use, and perception of water quality in affecting the water quality of small watershed streams in an agricultural settlement near Altamira, Brazil. The importance of two kinds of watershed land cover gradients are assessed: amount of forest in a watershed and amount of non-forest in a watershed, as pasture or cacao plantations, which are the two most predominant land uses near Altamira. Examination of water quality and stream water dissolved nutrient concentrations (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) at watershed stream outflow points, using standard sampling techniques, provides a summary of the impact of watershed land use on stream water quality. In addition, interviews with small farmers provide information on household structure and knowledge of the relationship between land use and water quality. Remote sensing analyses and a geographic information system are being used to generate information on larger spatial patterns of watershed land use changes. The investigators hypothesize that external market factors, such as prices for agricultural goods, and increasing water needs from agriculture are the predominant factors driving land use and subsequent changes in water quality and stream water dissolved nutrients.    The results of this study will provide valuable insights into household land use and environmental change in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In addition, as small streams are widespread in the Amazon Basin and provide important resources for many Amazonian inhabitants, including food and drinking water, the results of this research will provide insights to minimize detrimental impacts on water quality, particularly through understanding how household agricultural land and water use affects the underlying water quality and health of streams. While focused on land use changes in the Brazilian Amazon, this research also addresses land use issues worldwide, as local Amazonian watershed changes ultimately scale-up to affect worldwide ecology, such as global nutrient cycles, and economy, such as agriculture and trade.

The research asks whether females that mate with more than one male benefit directly, by producing more offspring than they would if they mated with just one male, or indirectly, by producing offspring of higher quality.  Conclusions will be based on DNA samples collected over 18 years from more than 4000 individuals and on long-term records of population dynamics and reproductive success. The study species, the dark-eyed junco, is a socially monogamous songbird.  Males and females form a long-term pair bond and jointly raise offspring, but ~25% of all offspring are sired by a male other than the socially bonded male.     Extra-pair mating is easily understood from the male?s perspective; a male?s reproductive success will increase if he mates with multiple females.  Less clear is why females participate in this behavior, and past research has not resolved the question.

The conjectures are closely related to splitting manifolds along codimension one  submanifolds.   This splitting problem is in turn related to nil  groups in algebraic K- and L-theory.  This project has several different aspects.  One is to solve the connected sum problem -- when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum?  Another is to provide a strengthening of the Farrell- Jones Conjecture in L-theory, similar to that achieved by Davis-Khan- Ranicki in K-theory.  Yet another is to classify involutions on a torus, using the computation of the L-theory of the infinite dihedral group and the proof of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in L-theory for crystallographic groups, joint with Connolly.  There are some middle and low dimensions problems too, involving mapping tori of self- homotopy equivalences of lens spaces and a certain aspect of link concordance.    The goal, as usual in geometric topology, is to use a variety of algebraic, geometric, and analytic techniques to find and compute invariants for classification. Geometric topology is the study of manifolds. An n-dimensional manifold is a set of points locally modeled on n-dimensional Euclidean space. For instance, a 2-manifold is a surface and looks like a plane near each point. Many physical phenomenon are represented by manifolds, and as such, understanding the global structure of a manifold, and what possible manifolds exist, is fundamental to the sciences, as well as to mathematics.  Manifold theory connects with most areas of mathematics, as well as with physical phenomena such as cosmology, string theory, and classical and quantum mechanics.",James Davis|

We focus on the role of microorganisms in controlling arsenic concentrations in aquifers, particularly at low values but still above the drinking water standards. The proposed study will determine quantitatively the role of microbial arsenate reduction in the bedrock aquifer in the Southern Willamette Basin, Oregon, USA. Arsenic occurs naturally in the aquifer at concentrations as high as 2000 parts per billion (ppb). This aquifer serves as a model for studying arsenic contamination in aquifers of felsic volcanic rocks and related alluvial sediments. We will conduct field biostimulation experiments and biogeochemical reactive transport modeling to test the hypothesis that microbial arsenate reduction controls significantly arsenic attenuation and mobilization in anoxic aquifers. Results of this study will pinpoint quantitatively the significance of different microbial functional groups in regulating arsenic concentrations in the aquifer. The theoretical component of this study will advance biogeochemical reaction modeling that couples microbial metabolisms with geochemical reactions. Results of this study will also provide critical information concerning groundwater microbiology for government agencies in designing effective strategies and regulations for groundwater resource management, monitoring, and protection. We will collaborate with science instructors at high schools near the field site to develop a replicable and sustainable classroom lesson on arsenic into their science curriculum.

To exploit inherent parallelism in such systems, multiple jobs can be run concurrently on different processor cores, each using the abundant on-chip resources.  As a result, considerable interactions among processor cores and resources may result in deadlocks and would be the most critical issue faced by such systems.  Software approaches to detect and resolve deadlock in such systems take longer time and may even fail to be timely invoked.     This research investigates a novel technique to inherently equip these systems with a hardware mechanism that can detect deadlocks very fast so that an OS can react in minimal time.  The central idea behind this methodology is to transform one form of complexity (e.g., graph) into another form of complexity (e.g., matrix) that can then be parallelized in hardware. This project develops various parallel hardware-oriented deadlock detection algorithms and their variations, which will be not only faster but will also dramatically reduce the run-time complexity from at most linear down to constant.  Moreover, the project also provides proofs of correctness and run-time complexity of these algorithms.  These proofs are essential for wide spread adoption in practical applications.  The research is of significant value to the reliability of many real-time systems such as medical robots, automobiles and avionics.  Finally, this project extends devised data structures and algorithms to potential algorithms in various other areas that utilize corresponding graph oriented data structures such as the Floyd-Warshall algorithm; the manipulation of B-tree, T-tree, R-tree and their variations; digital logic optimization; and Petri-net models.",Jaehwan Lee|

At the same time, high-level programming systems (e.g., scripting languages) have gained tremendous popularity motivated by dramatically higher programming productivity that such systems afford compared to traditional programming languages, such as C/C++ or Java. Unfortunately, these two trends combine to increase the gap between application software and the underlying hardware, which negatively impacts hardware utilization. An important reason is the critical nature of memory subsystems on the modern multi-core processors and a lack of any systematic methods to derive the memory behavior of programs written in high-level programming systems. This research aims at addressing the problem by developing a theoretical model to estimate the memory behavior of programs written in MATLAB and implementing the model in a prototype compiler.    A quantitative metric that past researchers have found useful in memory-related optimizations is reuse distance. Defined as the volume of data accessed between two successive references to a memory location, the goal is to transform programs to lower most of their reuse distances to below a threshold (usually, related to cache size).  By restricting the computation of reuse distances to locations accessible at the source-level it is possible to define source-level reuse distance. The metric, even though approximate, enables crucial analysis for high-level programming systems that often benefit remarkably from source-level transformations. This research develops efficient algorithms for source-level reuse distance analysis, validates it against the actual program behavior, and implements it in a MATLAB compiler to drive memory-related optimizations, especially those related to array accesses.",Arun Chauhan|

This project explores a novel approach that    is a synergy of the two: soliciting annotations from users about the    content of pages, in a way that implicitly forms networks of    relationships between and among resources and tags. These socially    generated relationships are then aggregated to build bottom-up,    global semantic similarity networks. Algorithms are developed to    construct, analyze, and mine these networks in support of search and    recommendation applications, exploratory navigation interfaces,    resource management utilities, tag spam detection, and incentive    games to accelerate the achievement of critical mass.    To extrapolate both annotations about content (tags) and semantic    relationships (similarity) from single users to the ``wisdom of the    crowd,'' the project investigates an information-theoretic model that    extracts semantic assessments from information structures that many    users are already maintaining, namely the bookmarks and tags they    manage on their browsers or online. This entails the design and    evaluation of several network-based measures and algorithms, such as    similarity, novelty, centrality, and focus. Among the aims of this    model are the exploration of the duality between resources (URLs) and    concepts (tags or categories) and the integration of social    annotation and collaborative filtering. One way to provide users with    immediate value is to integrate client-based taxonomies and server-   based folksonomies for social bookmark management. Both traditional    users of browser bookmarks and social users of online bookmarks can    take advantage of the same semantic maps while retaining the    convenience of intuitive browser interfaces and centralized storage.

The immediate focus is to provide an educational tool for conducting students, or others with some serious musical training who are capable of communicating musical intent clearly through the traditional language of gesture used by conductors.  However, the PI expects that less-schooled or novice users will also be able to learn from and find enjoyment with the outcome of this research, which will culminate in a computer system that runs on generic computer hardware, and will be made freely available.  The system will take video of a conductor as input, reducing this input into a two-dimensional conducting trace that describes the movement of the tip of the conductor's baton over time.  The system will perform real-time estimation of the conductor's precise ""state"" within the composition, using an approach that fuses hidden Markov model methodology with a Kalman filter model for musical timing.  Using this on-line estimate, the system will predict the location of future musical events, thus addressing the inevitable issue of detection latency.  Concurrently, the system will synthesize real-time audio to follow the conducted performance, using a previously recorded performance whose timing is continually warped using phase-vocoding.  The initial focus of this work will be on musical timing rather than dynamics, articulation, etc., as this is the aspect of conducting that is most clearly communicated through motion and usually also that which affords the most expressive potential and sense of ""ownership"" of the performance.  Educated musicians find surprising agreement when evaluating the accuracy with which a musician or ensemble follows a knowledgeable conductor, suggesting that the conductor's ""signal"" must be relatively unambiguous.  Making mathematical sense of the relationship between this signal and its meaning constitutes a challenging dimension of this research.    Broader Impacts:  This work will have lasting impact on conducting pedagogy, by providing a tireless and responsive laboratory for musical experimentation.   The research will also make contributions to instrumental and voice pedagogy, by allowing a musician to focus on the interpretive aspects of a piece without simultaneously addressing the technical challenges.  The problem of planning the orchestra's musical evolution with uncertain and continually evolving knowledge of the conductor's actions is deeply challenging; thus, this work has implications for the general domain of planning under uncertainty.   Perhaps most importantly for society at large, a successful conducting system would bring the pleasure of music-making to a broad and international collection of users who might otherwise have little or no experience creating music.",Christopher Raphael|

This decline in regenerative capacity in larvae occurs during development of several components of the adaptive immune system in these animals. Experiments designed in this study will test the hypothesis that changes in the developing frog's immune system, including the appearance of cells characteristic of an inflammatory response, modify the local limb environment to interfere with or preclude cellular events required for regeneration when the limb is lost. Previous analyses of tadpole limb regeneration by this laboratory have shown the expression of many inflammation-related genes and the appearance of various immunomodulatory proteins in the limb during the first days of regeneration. Other investigators working with skin regeneration in several mouse models have shown the regeneration seen at fetal stages of development persists in adults that are immunodeficient and have fetal-like immune systems.     This study will examine and quantify inflammation at the cellular and molecular levels during the early period of limb regeneration at larval stages when regeneration occurs successfully and at later stages when regeneration is poor. Procedures that affect inflammation positively and negatively will also be tested for their effects on regenerative capacity, using both molecular and morphological assays. The results are expected to reveal a strong correlation between loss of regenerative potential during development and strong or prolonged local inflammatory reactions to the regenerative stimulus. Such results will impact the emerging field of regenerative biology by highlighting the importance of peripheral immunity and immunomodulation in the local development of stem cells and tissue regeneration. The immune-regulating properties of various stem cells in mammalian models and their importance in tissue regeneration are increasingly recognized. Similar findings in a well-characterized amphibian model of regeneration will lead to greater understanding of the regenerative ability of these animals and the decline of this capacity in mammals. The broader impacts of the work, which are important not only for scientific advances but also for the education of graduate students in regenerative biology, include integrating considerations of the organism's immunity with cellular and molecular aspects of limb development, an integration required for a full appreciation of the factors controlling regeneration of organs in animals where the adaptive immune system is already functioning.",Anthony Mescher|

The central dopamine system has implications in many behavioral and cognitive tasks. A high-frequency response of the DA neuron is one of a few cellular events for which a clear physiological meaning has been proposed, and an immediate behavioral implication is the main determinant for great interest in properties of this cell. In a two-compartmental model of the DA cell, the canard and singular perturbation analysis will be applied to the bifurcation transition that corresponds to the onset of high-frequency oscillations. Timescale separations will be introduced to make the analysis possible. Then, the accuracy of proposed asymptotic approximations will be evaluated by comparison with simulations. In a morphological reconstruction, the investigators will reproduce distinctive properties of the spike generation mechanism of DA cells: 1. Its dependence on the subthreshold currents; 2. the contribution of active dendritic properties; 3. axonal initiation and presence of two components of a spike. Modeling will combine data on identified currents. Functional criteria will be applied to validate the model. Using the constructed model, synaptic integration properties of the DA neuron will be identified. Attenuation properties for a single spike and spike trains evoked at different dendritic locations will be measured in simulations. The dendritic tree is expected to be compartmentalized in such a way that synaptic inputs at certain locations elicit only somatic or only axonal spiking due to a significant spatial separation of the axon origin from the soma in DA neurons. Additionally, compartmentalization of the neuron may depend on the stimulation frequency because distal dendrites and the axon have much higher natural frequencies than the soma. Synchronization of spontaneously-evoked dendritic spikes and classical coincidence detection of synaptic inputs will be addressed in the model.    The above research will integrate experimental data on firing patterns and spike initiation of the DA cell to make conclusions about functional properties of the neuron. The project will open new possibilities to move the investigation of various behavioral functions involving the DA cells from the abstract to the biophysical context. It will layout the groundwork for further experiments. In its analytical part, the research will advance dynamical explanations to nontrivial biological phenomena and contribute to the extension of singular perturbation techniques to the vicinity of a bifurcation boundary. In the long perspective, understanding of DA cell functions will advance the development of new therapies to cure numerous disorders in which the central dopamine system is impaired.

Probabilities are assigned to events defined as subsets of a universal set, which obey all the laws of Boolean algebra. Quantum decision theory is based on quantum probability theory. Probabilities are assigned to events defined as subspaces of a Hilbert space, which obey all the laws of Boolean algebra except the distributive axiom. Following from the distributive axiom, classic probability theory adheres to one of its most important theorems, the law of total probability. Because quantum logic does not have to obey the distributive law, quantum probabilities do not have to obey the law of total probability. Instead, quantum probability theory must obey another law called the doubly stochastic law, which the classic probability model does not obey. Hence, the two probability theories are fundamentally different and the critical question is which set of rules provides a better description of human behavior. The immediate goal of this research is to rigorously compare decision models built upon classical probability theory with those built from quantum probability theory. To rigorously compare quantum versus classical probability models of decision making, a series of experiments will be conducted. The experiments focus on tests of the law of total probability and tests of the law of double stochasticity, where the two classes of models make major and qualitatively different predictions. The research will accomplish three objectives: (1) develop a new quantum theory of human inference and decision making, (2) conduct new empirical tests of the fundamental laws of total probability and double stochasticity using human inference and decision behavior, and (3) rigorously compare and contrast classic versus quantum models of decision making with respect to the new empirical findings. A quantum or classic model will be preferred only if it provides a superior scientific explanation of the phenomena with respect to both accuracy and parsimony.    The broad and long-term goal of this research program is to break new ground and pioneer a new path by building probabilistic and dynamic systems for social and behavioral sciences from quantum rather than classical probability principles. Previously, theorists in these fields have relied on mathematical models (e.g. stochastic differential equations) based on fundamental assumptions borrowed from classical physics. What are these fundamental assumptions? Are they overly restrictive? Social and behavioral scientists also face findings that remain paradoxical from a classic probability point of view. These paradoxes suggest that measurements in these fields may not always obey the law of total probability and entail different assumptions. This program of research also will contribute to the training of students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post doctoral levels at two major state universities. In addition to student training, the investigators will make an effort to train scientists in the area quantum cognition. They have conducted a full day tutorial at the annual Cognitive Science meeting and they plan to continue these tutorials in the future. They also plan to organize a special issue on Quantum Cognition in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. New graduate courses on quantum cognition and decision making will be prepared and presented at the graduate level, and finally, a resource web site will be developed with tutorial and reference information on quantum theory for social and behavioral sciences.",Jerome Busemeyer|

Over the past few decades, these resource systems have been the subject of numerous case studies and large-sample analyses investigating the efficiency of alternative forms of governance at encouraging long run sustainable harvesting. In particular, studies have focused on how government bureaucracies, specialized courts, religious figures, or privatization of the commons can improve long run resource management.  As the advanced democracies increasingly utilize voting institutions like commissions, committees, legislatures, or user-based associations to govern natural resource settings, however, it has become increasingly important to understand the capabilities and limitations of voting systems to produce policies yielding stable, long run resource yields.  How do different voting rules affect the final distribution of resource harvesting rights?  Under what structural conditions can voting lead to long run sustainability of resources?  And, under what conditions will voting create incentives to over-harvest?  The project investigates these questions by creating controlled laboratory experiments of how individuals divide a shared resource using majority rule voting.  	  To date, surprisingly little research has examined the effect of voting institutions in producing sustainable, long run extraction policies.  One might expect that a voting system will produce equitable outcomes since a diverse set of actors or stakeholders are a part of the decision making process.  It might also be the case, however, that some actors are capable of pushing through a proposal that either benefits one group at the expense of others or that short run political interest will trump long term sustainability considerations.  The project investigates how voting operates to aggregate or potentially mediate individual resource users' preferences for un-sustainable levels of extraction into successful resource management systems. By utilizing laboratory experiments that carefully control the characteristics of a shared resource among harvesters, this study tests the capabilities and limitations of existing theory to explain policy outcomes.  The findings will contribute to the real-world policy debates over how best to manage fragile resource stocks.",Elinor Ostrom|Robert Holahan

First, have two voluntary cap-and-trade programs, the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Carbon Disclosure Project, reduced carbon dioxide emissions and, if so, how do these reductions compare to those achieved by the mandatory carbon registry in Wisconsin and the European Union's Emissions Trading System?  Second, has the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange been cost-effective compared to the mandatory EU Emissions Trading system?  Third, what are the sources of inefficiency in the implementation of the mandatory EU cap-and-trade system, and how might these inefficiencies be reduced?      This project answers these questions using fuel-expenditure and electricity-expenditure data to determine whether each program has induced firms to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  The project also compares the costs of achieving emissions reductions for both trading systems against ex-ante theoretical estimates of the marginal costs of reducing carbon emissions.  Cost estimates of achieving emissions will be derived from carbon permit trading data. This project will interview firm managers and examine corporate responses to the Carbon Disclosure Project in order to uncover the specific sources of inefficiency in the European Union's cap and trade system.  In particular, this research will examine aspects of firm behavior that depart from the rational economic model and how characteristics of existing regulations have led to inefficiencies.    This project seeks to provide a better understanding of the extent to which firm behavior can be influenced by social and market pressures compared with government intervention.  While extensive research has studies the effectiveness of voluntary behavior by firms, this research has not explicitly compared voluntary actions to mandatory regulation.  In addition, taken as a whole, this research has been largely inconclusive regarding the prospects for effective voluntary action, particularly in the area of climate change policy.    Climate change policy has become an important issue.  It is crucial to understand the trade-offs between allowing market and social forces to shape firm behavior against the need for government intervention.  In addition, lessons from the European Union already demonstrate some of the pitfalls associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policy.  With several cap-and-trade proposals currently being discussed in Congress, it is increasingly important to understand the sources of inefficiency associated with greenhouse gas policy implementation.  Armed with a better understanding of these sources of inefficiency, policymakers can design policy that builds on the actual behavior of firms, rather than on assumptions of rational behavior, helps firms adapt to changing regulatory environments, and reduces barriers to efficient outcomes.",Evan Ringquist|Daniel Matisoff

These interactions are central themes in many biological and medical disciplines, and occupy a particularly prominent position in evolutionary biology. Ultimately, all evolutionary diversification of organismal form and function is only possible through changes in the nature of at least some of these interactions. The research project will explore the degree, nature and consequences of these interactions in the origin, development, and diversification of a complex class of traits that is emerging as a new model system in integrative organismal biology: beetle horns. Horned beetles offer incredible organismal richness and diversity, as well as accessibility to experimental manipulation. Using genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches this research project will 1) determine which genes underlie the formation of horns, 2) explore which genes allow horn development to be more or less responsive to nutritional conditions, and 3) explore how genes and hormones interact during horn development and evolution. This research will not only make a novel contribution to the fields of development, physiology, and evolution, but also facilitate an integration of the evolution of developmental processes with the behavioral and ecological mechanisms that guide such evolution in nature. This research program also interfaces tightly with several educational and outreach efforts. Firstly, six high school teachers and three minority high school students will be recruited into the investigators' laboratories during the summer to immerse them in research in development, evolution, and ecology. Teachers and students will be recruited through existing outreach programs with which both investigators are already affiliated. Secondly, this project will help train at least seven young scientists (6 undergraduate students, 1 postdoc) in intensive interdisciplinary research integrating developmental biology, physiology, genetics, molecular biology and evolution.

The instrument employs a pulsed glow discharge, which volatilizes analytes by means of argon-ion bombardment of the protein-containing spots on a GE plate.  The volatilized proteins and associated metals are lofted into an energetic region within the glow, where they are atomized and emit light with wavelengths characteristic of each element present.  Analyzing the emitted light then enables the identification of the identity and concentration of each element present, and indeed of the proteins themselves.  This capability is made more efficient through use of an imaging spectrometer, which permits all the protein-containing spots on a GE plate to be examined simultaneously.

They plan to do archival research at the British Library and at the Wellcome Institute in London, and in Oxford at the Bodleian Library and in the university records. These archives contain the correspondence and notebooks of the seventeenth-century physician and physiologist Nathaniel Highmore, as well as contemporary notes on experiments and lectures that are closely related to his work.    Intellectual merit: Highmore was a friend and collaborator of William Harvey: a comparison between their works will clarify a number of issues related to the problems of generation emerging from contemporary debates. Central developments in early modern science, philosophy, and medicine converged in Highmore's remarkable work, particularly, in his discoveries and novel explanations of reproductive organs, generation, and hysteria. The archival research builds on two studies of Highmore's s published works that have been presented at history of science conferences. There are several respects in which archive visits are crucial to the dissertation: the extensive collections of unpublished writings will shed light on Highmore's medical education, intellectual sources, interactions with patients, the role of experiments and medical experience on his research, the development of his thought, and the reception of his published texts. No close examinations of these important sources have been published. This project focuses in particular on the early stages of the appropriation of chemistry by academic medicine, which remains virtually unexplored. Moreover, studying the student notebooks will enhance historical understanding of early seventeenth-century medical education, particularly the extent to which students were exposed to the new sciences, philosophies, and experimentation.    Broader impact: The proposed project examines major questions about life that persist to this day: What distinguishes living from non-living matter? At what point do fetuses acquire human status? The aim is to provide a critical analysis and historical understanding of these questions that are heavily enmeshed with ethical and religious values. These issues also serve as a locus at which to examine how different areas of science, medicine, metaphysics, epistemology, and theology informed each other during the mid-seventeenth century. The interdisciplinary and synchronistic nature of the project means that it has broad ramifications for early modernists. The theme of the upcoming joint meeting of the British, US, and Canadian history of science societies, ""Connecting Disciplines,"" reflects the field's recognition of the value of interdisciplinary studies. Portions of the research will be presented during 2008, both at the international meeting and at a conference on early modern chemistry, physiology and medicine.

His theory of natural magic initiated an important shift in Western thought that played a crucial role in medieval natural philosophy, generating models of causality which did not rely on supernatural agents (divine, demonic, etc.). This dissertation will provide substantial new primary resources for historical study through archival research into William, and will provide a much-needed analysis of his writings on magic and unseen forces in nature.    Intellectual Merit: A critical study of William's writings and their role in the academic debates of the thirteenth and fourteenth century will be a crucial contribution to an improved understanding of the historical struggle between scientific and religious paradigms in Western thought, and may prove a useful recovery of philosophical and rhetorical strategies for managing these conflicts. The research will yield original work that will improve our understanding of William and his influence on later natural thinkers. From this base of archival study, answers to the following key questions can be derived: How did theologians who were also natural philosophers (and hence scientists of the Middle Ages) negotiate the creation of distinct epistemological categories for science and religion? How did William's ethnographical investigations and sensibilities enable him to break free of existing doctrine? In what ways did his unconventional approach of treating ""high,"" ""low,"" and non-Western cultures of knowing (e.g., university, ecclesiastical, popular, fabulous, Islamic) as viable sources of data provide an advantage in his innovation of an explanatory account of hidden forces in nature as causal mechanisms for phenomena previously attributed to the action of spirits?    Broader Impacts: The study will examine social ramifications of William's innovations by addressing these questions. How did he navigate the perils of intellectual transgression--namely, courtly disfavor, accusations of heresy, and possible expulsion from his ecclesiastical or university post--during a time of tremendous upheaval where such ramifications were hardly rare? How does the separation of magic, science, and religion begin to take shape in the context of the formation of secular universities in the late Middle Ages, and in what ways should we begin to revise common beliefs about the assumed longevity and nature of the historical ""war"" between science and religion as a consequence? What are the ramifications of a better understanding of the rhetorical strategies and the gradual social adoption of new locutions and categories in debates over natural magic in the late Middle Ages for modern intellectual culture?",William Newman|Sarah Smith

Data collection will involve in-depth interviews with thirty key informants, ethnographic fieldwork, including extensive participant observation, and 120 social networks interviews with residents in Riverwest, a stably-integrated neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Currently, there is little empirical investigation of the neighborhood-level relationship between residential integration?the co-existence of racial and ethnic groups in a community?and social integration?meaningful and/or useful cross-race ties.  Thus, scholars do not know whether increasing demographic integration leads to the many assumed benefits of integration on interracial interaction and exchange (e.g. resource sharing, improved racial relations, increased access to social and cultural capital that support social mobility).  This research will address the following research questions: How do local organizations (commercial, civic, religious, social service) in a residentially-integrated neighborhood facilitate cross-race social integration and/or reinforce social segregation?  How do residents of a residentially-integrated neighborhood ?frame? (assign meaning to) their neighborhood?  How do these understandings of the neighborhood affect how residents act in and toward their neighborhood?  The goal of the research is to explain how residents of a residentially-integrated neighborhood make social distinctions within their local context and provide insight into how symbolic boundaries affect resident interactions of the neighborhood (e.g., where to go, how to interact, whom to interact with or avoid, how to deal with problems).  Overall, the research aims to advance sociological understanding of social and cultural processes central to the perpetuation of inequality and to the promotion of equality by grounding these processes in a diverse residential context.  By identifying local practices and organizational features that limit or enhance the development of interethnic ties, the research will suggest policies that could support the successful integration of neighborhoods and maximize the benefits of integration.",Robert Robinson|Evelyn Perry

This study will answer these questions by comparing collective memories of the communist Yugoslavia among two Croatian post-Yugoslav generations. Croatia was one of the six republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Its post-communist transformation in the 1990s co-occurred with a war for independence and nation-building under an authoritarian regime that sought to affirm its legitimacy in opposition to Yugoslavia. But, the regime change in 2000 brought a new liberalizing period, potentially opening up the public discourse on Yugoslavia. This research will examine how different perceptions of the Yugoslav past develop among two different post-Yugoslav generations. The first is the transitional generation that has early childhood memories of Yugoslavia, but that spent formative years in the authoritarian post-Yugoslav period. The second is the post-communist generation that has no personal experience of Yugoslavia, but that spent its formative years in the liberalizing period. First, using textual analysis of the newspapers and the history textbooks, the researcher will examine what narratives of Yugoslavia were available to these two generations in the authoritarian and the liberal period of the post-Yugoslav Croatia. Second, using in-depth interviews, the researcher will compare how the transitional and post-communist generations negotiate Yugoslavia in their own perceptions of the Yugoslav past and what they make of their family stories and media and school accounts. Finally, with these data, the researcher will seek to explain how the available public narratives, family stories and formative years' experiences influence the personal narratives of communist Yugoslavia among these two generations. This will illuminate the process of generational transmission of cultural meanings, and it will also enhance the understanding of the interacting influences of the political elites, the media and individuals and the role this interaction has for the formation of cultural consensus. Therefore, by examining the process of generational transmission of political consciousness and the interrelations between personal experiences and institutional frameworks, this study will contribute to the understanding of comprehensive social changes and the role of culture in both restricting and enabling societal transformations. Further, this research will shed light on how the narratives of the old and unforgiven grievances get perpetuated or abandoned by the young people. Considering that the perceptions of the past are often the fuelling force for conflicts (ethnic conflicts in particular), as well as the building blocks for social integration, these insights can help policy-makers pave the road for the reconciliation, both in the region and beyond. Additionally, these findings can also be applied to other areas of societal conflict, and therefore they will be of interest to policy-makers interested in programs aimed at mitigating various other society-wide divisive issues (e.g. immigration issues, race, post-conflict resolution) and in the programs of reconciliation and integration.",Brian Steensland|Tanja Vuckovic Juros

This work focuses on the hypothesis that many aspects of genome evolution are driven by nonadaptive forces (random genetic drift, mutation, and recombination) rather than natural selection responding to external ecological forces. Using mathematical/computational analysis, the research will exploit the enormous set of resources available from whole-genome sequencing projects, from viruses to organelles to bacteria and multicellular species. Because evolution is a population-level process, priority will be on developing a general theory for genomic evolution consistent with well-established principles of population genetics, while spanning the fields of computational biology and informatics, molecular and cellular biology, and systems biology.  The overall goal is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics. Under the proposed hypothesis, many of the complex genomic features that are the hallmark of multicellular species emerged largely as a consequence of a substantial reduction in the efficiency of selection, whereas the streamlined genomes of microbial species result from highly efficient selection opposing the accumulation of mutationally hazardous excess DNA. At the very least, the theory to be developed provides a null (nonadaptive) hypothesis for interpreting the evolution of genome complexity.     Broader Impact:   Through the integration of these various subprojects, the overall goal of the proposed research is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics, as well as to help develop the intellectual infrastructure that will ultimately be necessary for the emergence of a field of evolutionary cell biology. In addition, the research project will be intertwined with a set of educational goals, including: 1) the establishment of an annual set of projects associated with a genome evolution class that services students from both the life sciences and informatics; 2) the recruitment of mathematically inclined biology undergraduates into a two- to three-year research program; and 3) the development of an integrative ?training-grant?-like environment among the grant participants.",Michael Lynch|

Wakes are the volume downwind of individual turbines where wind speed is reduced and turbulence is enhanced due to energy extraction at the preceding turbine. In large offshore wind farms, power losses due to wakes can exceed 20% of total potential power production and lead to an increase in fatigue loading reducing turbine lifetimes. The objective of the research is to quantify and improve predictive capability for the development, propagation, combination and dissipation of wind turbine wakes in large onshore wind farms.  Wake models used in current wind farm prediction tools under-predict power losses in large wind farms. There are two potential explanations; (1) large wind farms create additional turbulence which fundamentally alters the structure of the overlying boundary-layer, (2) combining wakes from individual turbines both downwind and laterally is mis-specified by the current generation of wind farm models. Evaluation of the models in small wind farms (three rows or smaller) indicates that models are able to capture power losses due to wakes which lends support to these two hypotheses that pertain to large multi-row arrays.     This project will combine statistical analysis of observed wind farm data with evaluation and development of three classes of models (from the analytic to computational fluid dynamics codes) to improve predictions of wake losses. The goal is to produce a model that accurately captures wake propagation and interactions in different wind speed, turbulence and atmospheric stability conditions, to model wake combination in a more realistic way and to account for changes in the structure of the boundary-layer. Ultimately, this will produce a model which accurately quantifies wake losses for existing wind farm layouts and will allow assessment of wind farm layouts (turbine spacing) which are optimized for wake losses.  The outcome from this project will contribute unique insight into how wakes propagate through large wind farms, and transform the ways in which wake impacts on power output are modeled.    This project will be led by Professor R.J. Barthelmie, a renowned leader in wind energy research, and will be conducted in collaboration with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Airtricity/E.ON, a world leading renewable energy company. Both have agreed to provide data from operating large wind farms and to collaboration on model application and evaluation. This collaboration will both enhance the project and increase symbioses and knowledge transfer. The project will also enhance educational and training opportunities at Indiana University.",Rebecca Barthelmie|Sara Pryor

The lab is a new facility with a strong and ongoing environmental research emphasis.  Since 2001 Indiana University has strongly supported the lab by developing a facility for studies ranging from forest, grassland, and invasion ecology to atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemistry.  In its short history, the facility has established a reputation for a strong user base and impressive scientific record. The Lab has developed a strong track record of supporting minorities and other underrepresented groups in the sciences, including participation in institutional and federal programs such as the Jim Holland Summer Enrichment Program for minority high school students. The IURTP is also equipped with effective mechanisms for public outreach, K-12 education, and undergraduate training.    The award will improve access to research and education at the lab by providing internet access via a high-speed, optic fiber data link.  The fast data link and real-time data monitoring system will allow the remote access and retrieval of data, diversifying opportunities for participation in IURTP research and teaching activities. It will also allow researchers to access real time data from their field sites and to communicate with instruments without actually having to travel to the remote study site. The IT infrastructure will poise the facility to be a key institution in the evolving regional to continental networks like NEON. It will eventually allow teachers to conduct field courses that can be ?attended? virtually by students who are located anywhere in the world, as long as they have a computer with an internet connection.  The proposed improvements in cyberinfrastructure for the IURTP provide many outlets for public outreach and science education (information displays, seminars, field trips, web broadcasts).",Keith Clay|

It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught.     This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project's main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training.     The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students' relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies.     This Project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally. This Project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border.",Noriko Hara|

This research has two complementary goals. One is to field for the first time core items from the highly successful European Social Survey (ESS) to better enable comparisons between European nations and the United States. Cross-nationally standardized items are essential to survey measurement, and this project will build from the ESS data collection, extending measurement of welfare attitudes to the key case of the United States.     The project's second thematic goal is to make use of an experimental design in which hypotheses about causal sources of welfare state attitudes can be adjudicated. Embedded survey experiments hold considerable promise in advancing scholarly understanding of attitude and preference formation. The dual focus of this project is on framing (in which the description of a social policy or its beneficiaries are varied) and sponsorship (in which the source of these descriptions are varied). Together, framing and sponsorship are essential elements of social and historical context that are typically held constant in opinion surveys. Building from the conventional social survey, the methodological benefit of survey experiments is to unpack these elements of context so that hypotheses about specific frames and competing sponsors can be evaluated.     This project and data collection provides American and European scholars with a new survey with which to evaluate how and why social policy attitudes vary in the contemporary historical era. It provides for the principal investigator and larger European research team (of which this project is the United States component) the data with which to conduct survey based individual and multi-level analysis. Subsequent research projects are expected to offer novel explanations of why mass opinion on social welfare continues to differ across the worlds most developed nations. In fielding embedded survey experiments, this project offers new insights into mechanisms behind the formation of policy preferences. These experiments contribute to a firmer understanding of the United States in cross-national perspective. It is hoped that knowledge generated through these experiments may stimulate further applications of experimental surveys in cross-national research.",Ernest Brooks|

Sustainability Science and Engineering is unified in clear terms by its ultimate goals but occupies an interdisciplinary position among traditional research fields, spanning both science and engineering and spreading across disciplines as diverse as agriculture, ecology, oceanography, climate studies, economics, a diverse set of social sciences, energy and materials and several additional aspects of engineering, physics, biology, and chemistry. Although Sustainability Science and engineering is by now widely discussed in the scientific and engineering community, and is beginning to be connected to the political agenda for economic and social development, it remains unclear to what extent its many facets are being integrated into a global perspective and whether researchers are utilizing it as a nexus to collaborate across traditional scientific and engineering fields. This project will address such issues by delineating, analyzing, and mapping both basic research on sustainability. Specifically, a comprehensive dataset of scholarly publications, patents, research grants, policy documents and popular science pieces that together define the integrated knowledge of the field will be compiled.     Analysis results will be presented as tables, graphs, and in form of geospatial and science maps. Sustainability experts will be invited to interpret these results. Findings will be presented, discussed, and disseminated via scholarly publications, online, and at a workshop on the topic of sustainability. Encouraging timely scientific and engineering progress across a large set of traditional disciplines requires generating a global perspective (a view 'from above') to determine the most effective actions and incentives to be created by governments, funding agencies, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, and the public at large. This work will map the current state of sustainability science and engineering worldwide and provide actionable insights into its future development.

These are costly and urgent current threats; results of preliminary research were presented at the USENIX 2008 Workshop on Offensive Technologies and an article in the Washington Post on July 16, 2008 reported on this paper.      The project envisions the three specific problems as representing three major classes of the users' web risks and thus leading to a user-centric security framework.  The broad research activities include:   1. Measurement: through a combination of active Web crawling and passive observation, the research is quantifying the nature and extent of the three threats, and in the process developing techniques for accurately identifying their occurrences.   2. User-centric correlation studies: When multiple web sites subscribe to the same web bug hosting company, that (malicious) company can track user behavior across multiple sites.  This is one example of a correlation threat.  The project also studies the correlated threats to user security and privacy.       The broader impacts of the project include:  1. User security and privacy on the Web: The project advances a user-centric view of security and privacy on the Web.  This is a current and urgent social need.

The project is developing a prototype called SYMBIOTE to demonstrate real-time processing of high bandwidth multimedia data streams in a computer vision based traffic monitoring system.     Using hardware-assisted designs and decomposition strategies to achieve its stream storage model, this project introduces new query operators such as the split-choose and merge operators, and a macro-operator called split-merge.  It is building a library of such DSMS operators, realizable in reconfigurable logic hardware, that are reusable, parameterizable,  and exhibit reduced run-time and reduced spatial complexity Example hardware-accelerated operators include Filter, Map, Union, Bsort, Aggregate and Join. The project also investigates hardware implementations of strategies such as approximate query answering for sliding windows; landmark windows; and sketches, random sampling, and wavelets.     This project extends the Borealis query language of ?boxes and arrows? with the additional intent to address deployment characteristics in SYMBIOTE.  The objective is to perform static query optimization using a heuristic best-effort static query planning and diagram placement algorithm that together can minimize the dynamic configuration effort of RLADSMS. This optimization strategy uses a novel cost model for RLADSMS based on the spatial complexity of hardware DSMS operators, run-time complexity of hardware/software operators, and many SYMBIOTE sensor node properties.  Sensor node properties can include camera characteristics, frame-rate, number of look-up tables (LUTs)/logic cells, and embedded block RAMs.  The optimization can also consider communication properties such as interconnect latencies and bandwidth. The research outcomes of this project are expected to be widely applicable to multimedia sensor network based DSMSs, such as border patrol and building security applications, and possibly to the financial data processing domain. Moreover, this research spurs the academic exploration of  novel ideas and creation of new courses in the area of hardware/software codesign of DSMSs.",Jaehwan Lee|Yuni Xia|Yingzi Du

From the network relationships that are implied by messaging among processes arise implicit data structures and implicit algorithms - that is, global parallel data structures and global parallel algorithms for which there is no explicit global representation. Limited only to a local approach for creating parallel programs, achieving correctness and performance of large-scale parallel algorithms is rapidly moving beyond our reasoning abilities. To address this shortcoming, this project develops a declarative language approach for describing new high-level communication operations, a means for composing these operations with computations, and a means for expressing transformations for optimizing the resulting compositions.    This project's implementation plan is based on aggressive evolution of the technology that is currently most effective in large-scale parallel computing - namely, explicitly managed shared data. In the distributed-memory case this is achieved with message passing, but the same discipline can be applied in the shared memory case as well. This project's approach may enable higher levels of expressiveness and abstraction for data management, communication, and coordination. Moreover, the separation of concerns that is naturally imposed between communication and computation greatly simplifies the mental model and implementation effort for programmers. In order not to sacrifice performance because of this division, this scheme's composition and transformation mechanisms will allow communication and computation to be (automatically) combined in an optimized fashion so that high performance and high scalability are achieved. To facilitate adoption by practicing programmers of the paradigms and tools that are developed, integration with education is essential. Accordingly, this project will directly train undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers and will develop supporting curricula and materials to train both students and practicing programmers. Close collaboration with large-scale real-world scientific applications will further increase the practical relevance of this work.",Andrew Lumsdaine|Arun Chauhan

It enhances contemporary methods of content-based searching and retrieval of musical information from online databases and stored in a variety of formats ranging from encoded score files to digital audio.  The type of system proposed would for the first time make it possible for scholars to compare relationships among musical works and among versions of the same work in a new flexible ways.

Regular conferences continually spark new ideas and potential new research directions.  The purpose of this grant is to provide the means to foster the new collaborations and new research projects among midwest topologists at different universities that would otherwise go unpursued.  This grant would support three key types of activity: Travel for research collaboration, travel for beginning researchers, and exchange with other networks.    Algebraic topology attempts to reduce questions about space and geometry to questions in algebra.  Often this involves assigning some kind of algebraic object like a vector space or numerical invariant to a geometric object or space to capture or measure some intrinsic feature.  These invariants can then potentially be used to distinguish between different spaces.  The invariants studied are typically discrete, and so they do not change under continuous deformation or ""homotopy"".  This freedom often allows topologists to deform complicated problems into simpler ones that have the same invariants, which are then easier to compute.  Since the simpler problems often retain important information about the original mathematical objects, algebraic topology provides effective tools for a wide range of mathematical problems.",Michael Mandell|
