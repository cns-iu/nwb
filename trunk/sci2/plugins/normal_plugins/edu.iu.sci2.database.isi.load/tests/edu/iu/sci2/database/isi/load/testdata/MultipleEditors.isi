AB Planarians change in body size depending upon whether they are in
   feeding or starving conditions. To investigate how planarians regulate
   this flexible system, the numbers of total cells and specific cell
   types were counted and compared among worms 2 mm to 9 mm in body
   length. The total cell number increased linearly with increasing body
   length, but the ratio of cell numbers between the head and the trunk
   portion was constant (1:3). Interestingly, counting the numbers of
   specific neurons in the eye and brain after immunostaining using cell
   type-specific antibodies revealed that the ratio between different
   neuron types was constant regardless of the brain and body size. These
   results suggest that planarians can maintain proportionality while
   changing their body size by maintaining a constant ratio of different
   cell types. To understand this system and reveal how planarians restore
   the original ratio during eye and brain regeneration, the numbers of
   specialized cells were investigated during regeneration. The results
   further substantiate the existence of some form of "counting mechanism"
   that has the ability to regulate both the absolute and relative numbers
   of different cell types in complex organs such as the brain during cell
   turnover, starvation, and regeneration.
