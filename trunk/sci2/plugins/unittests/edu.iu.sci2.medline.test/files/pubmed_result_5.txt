TI  - The Antidepressant Sertraline Provides a Promising Therapeutic Option for
      Neurotropic Cryptococcal Infections.
AB  - Therapeutic treatment for systemic mycoses is severely hampered by the extremely 
      limited number of antifungals. Treatment for fungal infections in the central
      nervous system is further compounded by the poor CNS penetration of most
      antifungals due to the blood-brain barrier. Only a few fungistatic azole drugs,
      such as fluconazole, show reasonable CNS penetration. Here we demonstrate that
      sertraline (brand name Zoloft), the most prescribed antidepressant, displays
      potent antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, the major causative
      agent of fungal meningitis. In the in vitro assays, this neurotrophic drug is
      fungicidal to all natural Cryptococcus isolates tested at clinically relevant
      concentrations. Furthermore, sertraline interacts synergistically or additively
      with fluconazole against Cryptococcus. Importantly, consistent with our in vitro 
      observations, sertraline alone reduces the brain fungal burden at a comparable
      efficacy as fluconazole in a murine model of systemic cryptococcosis. It works
      synergistically with fluconazole in reducing the fungal burden in brain, kidney, 
      and spleen. In contrast to its potency against Cryptococcus, sertraline is less
      effective against strains of Candida species and its interactions with
      fluconazole against Candida strains are often antagonistic. Therefore, our data
      suggest the unique application of sertraline against cryptococcosis. To
      understand the antifungal mechanisms of sertraline, we screened the whole genome 
      deletion collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for altered sertraline
      susceptibility. Gene ontology analyses of selected mutations suggest that
      sertraline perturbs translation. In vitro translation assays using fungal cell
      extracts show that sertraline inhibits protein synthesis. Taken together, our
      findings indicate the potential of adopting this antidepressant in treating
      cryptococcal meningitis.

TI  - Five years of sucsessful prevention of malignant epidermal tumors: data from the 
      referral center of dermatologic oncology, ministry of health and social welfare, 
      croatia.
PG  - 57
AB  - The main goals of the Referral Center of Dermatologic Oncology, Ministry of
      Health and Social Welfare, Republic of Croatia, set in 2006 included collection
      and processing of epidemiological data on malignant epidermal tumors in Croatia, 
      improved diagnosis and treatment of malignant epidermal tumors, promotion of
      diagnosis and treatment of primary skin lymphomas, prevention of malignant skin
      tumors, education of dermatovenereologists in the field of dermatologic oncology,
      and collaboration and team approach in the field of dermatologic oncology. In
      line with the conditions stated by the Ministry Rule Book, the Referral Center
      had successfully performed the tasks and achieved good scientific and
      professional results in upgrading prevention of various skin tumors. A total of
      8174 minor surgical procedures were performed, including operative removal of
      various pigment lesions, epidermal malignant tumors and deep biopsy for
      inflammatory dermatoses. Superficial radiotherapy was performed in 820 patients. 
      Photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was used in 171 patients
      with actinic keratoses, Bowen disease and broad superficial basal cell
      carcinomas. The diagnosis of skin lymphoma was made in 114 patients. T-cell
      primary skin lymphoma accounted for the majority of cases (77.5%), whereas the
      diagnosis of B-cell primary skin lymphoma was made in ten (12.5%) patients.
      Mycosis fungoides was the most common primary skin lymphoma, diagnosed in 94
      patients, i.e. 90% of all T immunophenotype primary skin lymphomas. Excellent
      collaboration and team approach has been established with pathologists,
      hematologists and oncologists as necessary. Primary prevention included education
      of the population at large, young people in particular, on the measures of
      protection from excessive sun exposure. In the scope of secondary prevention, we 
      invested all our knowledge and efforts in early diagnosis and early therapy of
      malignant skin tumors, which is closely related to better prognosis and lower
      treatment cost. Members of the Referral Center have regularly participated in the
      project of skin tumor prevention, Euromelanoma Day Croatia since 2008, when the
      Croatian Dermatovenereological Society joined this project launched by the
      European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.

TI  - Cumulative Impact of a Clover Cover Crop on the Persistence and Efficacy of
      Beauveria bassiana in Suppressing the Pecan Weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).
PG  - 298-307
AB  - The pecan weevil, Curculio caryae (Horn), is a key pest of pecan. Endemic levels 
      of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin can occur
      in pecan orchards and contribute to natural control of C. caryae. Commercial
      formulations of the fungus can also be applied for suppression of C. caryae. We
      hypothesized that a clover cover crop enhances B. bassiana efficacy and
      persistence (e.g., by protecting the fungus against abiotic environmental
      stresses). The hypothesis was tested by conducting field trials in a pecan
      orchard in Byron, GA, in 2009 and 2010. The study included four treatments
      arranged in a factorial with two levels of fungus (endemic fungus only, and
      application of a commercial B. bassiana product), and two levels of clover (white
      clover, Trifolium repens L., and no clover). Fungal persistence was measured by
      determining the number of CFUs per gram of soil over time (during 42 d
      postapplication of B. bassiana in 2009 and 29 d in 2010). Efficacy was measured
      by capturing naturally emerging C. caryae and subsequently determining mortality 
      and mycosis (over 24 d in 2009 and 17 d in 2010). In 2009, greater prevalence of 
      B. bassiana conidia was detected in plots receiving fungal applications compared 
      with no fungus applications, and no clear effect of clover was observed in plots 
      receiving B. bassiana applications in either year. In 2010, B. bassiana
      prevalence in the endemic fungus plus clover treatment was higher than fungus
      without clover, and was similar to plots receiving additional B. bassiana
      applications. Given that we observed enhanced persistence of endemic B. bassiana 
      in 2010 but not 2009, the impact of clover appears to be a cumulative effect.
      Mortality of C. caryae (averaged over the sampling periods) ranged between 68-74%
      in plots receiving B. bassiana applications and 51-56% in plots with endemic
      fungus only. C. caryae mortality and mycosis data also provided evidence that
      endemic B. bassiana efficacy was enhanced by clover relative to plots without
      clover (with no clear clover effect on plots receiving fungus applications).
      Thus, we conclude that natural control of C. caryae can increase when clover is
      grown in pecan orchards with endemic populations of B. bassiana.

TI  - Towards understanding of toxic side effects of a polyene antibiotic amphotericin 
      B: Fluorescence spectroscopy reveals widespread formation of the specific
      supramolecular structures of the drug.
AB  - Amphotericin B (AmB) is a lifesaving polyene antibiotic used widely to treat
      deep-seated mycoses. Both the pharmaceutical effectiveness as well as toxic side 
      effects depend on molecular organization of the drug. In the present study we
      analyzed steady-state fluorescence, fluorescence anisotropy spectra, fluorescence
      lifetimes and fluorescence anisotropy decays of AmB in the systems believed to
      assure monomeric organization of the drug and in model lipid membranes. The
      results of the analyses show that in all of the systems studied, the drug appears
      in, at least, two spectral forms, interpreted as monomeric and aggregated.
      Spectroscopic and fluorescence lifetime characteristics of both forms are
      provided. Interpretation of the fluorescence anisotropy spectra of AmB
      incorporated into liposomes formed with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine let
      conclude that monomers of the drug are more tightly bound to the lipid membranes 
      as compared to the aggregates and that AmB aggregates destabilize the membrane
      structure. Structural model analysis, compared to the analysis of spectral
      shifts, leads to the conclusion that basic constituents of AmB aggregated
      structure is a tetramer composed of two hydrogen-bond-stabilized dimers, each
      dimer formed by molecules twisted by ca. 170 deg. The tetramer itself can span
      lipid bilayers and can act as a transmembrane ion channel. Specific aggregate
      formation of AmB has been concluded as an universal and ubiquitous form of
      molecular organization of the drug. This process is discussed in terms of toxic
      side effects of AmB.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and immunomodulatory effect of intralipid
      formulation of nystatin in mice.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We developed a novel lipid formulation of nystatin suitable for
      parenteral administration, nystatin-intralipid (NYT-IL), with antifungal activity
      and reduced toxicity in mice. We investigated the pharmacokinetics, tissue
      distribution and immunomodulatory effect of NYT-IL in mice. METHODS: Nystatin
      levels in serum and organs were determined using HPLC after NYT-IL or nystatin
      administration in mice. The levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and the
      anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) produced by splenocytes from
      mice injected with NYT-IL or nystatin were evaluated by an ELISA assay. RESULTS: 
      Injection of NYT-IL resulted in similar levels and similar kinetics of nystatin
      in serum, higher concentrations in the liver and lower concentrations in the
      kidneys, in comparison with nystatin injection. Injection of mice with NYT-IL
      yielded higher levels of IL-10 than that of nystatin, whereas the levels of
      TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induced by NYT-IL were lower than those elicited by
      nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: Since polyene treatment is associated with nephrotoxicity,
      lower levels of nystatin in the kidneys following NYT-IL injection suggest the
      possibility of reduced toxicity. As the acute infusion-related adverse effects
      associated with polyene treatment are considered to be induced by
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, a higher level of anti-inflammatory and lower levels 
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines elicited by NYT-IL administration suggest the
      possibility of amelioration of such effects. In summary, the altered
      pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and immune response due to the use of this 
      intralipid formulation of nystatin merit further research towards the development
      of a therapeutic agent against invasive mycoses.
