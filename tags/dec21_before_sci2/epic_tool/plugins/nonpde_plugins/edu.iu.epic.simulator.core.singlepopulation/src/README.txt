Before start compiling the executables (ExactEM and SPEM), please download 
the boost library from http://www.boost.org/. Copy all the boost source into 
SPEM/include/boost/

Alert: make sure the output files generated by ExactEM and SPEM are in '.out'
extention rather than '.out.dat.gz'. Windows not support the gz format.
