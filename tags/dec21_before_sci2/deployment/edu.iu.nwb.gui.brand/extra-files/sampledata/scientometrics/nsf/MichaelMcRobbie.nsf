McRobbie  Indiana University - Bloomington    MRI:  Creation of the AVIDD Data Facility:  a Distributed Facility for Managing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Instrument-Driven Data      This is a proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training across a broad range of instrument-driven data-intensive science areas.  The proposed distributed facility for managing, analyzing, and visualizing instrument-driven data would address the data life cycle consisting of data capture and remote data reduction;  high speed data transfer;  real time data analysis and processing;  data storage;  data retreival;  data analysis and postprocessing;  data visualization;  and the use of remote data stores.  Among the research projects enhanced and enabled by the proposed facility are both computer science and applications area projects, for example work on end-to-end real time data management for remote control and use of beam-line systems by X-ray crystallographers"

Funding is provided to establish a 20 gigabit/second connection from Indiana University and Purdue University through Indianapolis to the Chicago Hub of the ETF.    As a result of the funding provided through this Terascale Extension Award, Indiana University and Purdue University will be contributing a significant fraction of their resources to the ETF user community including: 1) a heterogeneous group of systems delivering 1.67 teraflops on an ongoing basis with the capability to offer up to 6.26 teraflops for very demanding well-justified applications; 2) a baseline storage capacity offered as part of ETF would include 129 terabytes with peak demand contributions exceeding 400 terabytes;  3) access to a variety of visualization resources including a CAVE, an Immersadesk, Display Walls, etc. are also offered; 4) specialized instrumentation facilities including the Purdue Terrestrial Observatory, and the Service Crystallography at Advanced Photon Sources (SCrAPS); and 5) access to a number of large scientific data sets in the life sciences, earth system simulations, vegetation and soils research, multispectral remote sensing imaging, geological GIS data, economic and social scientific data, and anthropological data.     Investigators at both Indiana University and Purdue University will also contribute significantly to the broader goals of the Extensible Terascale Facility.  They have a significant concentration of expertise in areas of grid computing, middleware, and portal development.  Both universities, through their IP-Grid participation, also have extensive outreach activities fostering the training and education of a diverse technological workforce extending from K-12 programs through undergraduate and graduate programs."

The project will involve a large team of interdisciplinary researchers at multiple sites.  There is as of yet no comparable digital music library to that presented in   the proposal.  As a digital library system, the DML will provide integrated multimedia access to a large corpus of musical material.  As a research and educational resource for a large, diverse group of   communities, the project promises to draw out new uses and user needs and stimulate creative activities in many areas."
