Apache Commons HTTP Client
--------------------------

"Although the java.net package provides basic functionality for accessing 
resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility or functionality 
needed by many applications. The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component seeks 
to fill this void by providing an efficient, up-to-date, and feature-rich 
package implementing the client side of the most recent HTTP standards and 
recommendations."
