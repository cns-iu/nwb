"Jetty is an open-source, standards-based, full-featured web server implemented 
entirely in java. It is released under the Apache 2.0 licence and is therefore 
free for commercial use and distribution. First created in 1995, Jetty has 
benefitted from input from a vast user community and consistent and focussed 
development by a stable core of lead developers. Full commercial 24x7 support, 
training and development services for Jetty are available from Webtide."
