Further, their use in research programs world-wide has had a major impact on many sciences.      The societal benefits of particle accelerators are especially evident in material science, nuclear medicine, molecular biology and in many other fields. Charged particles or the radiation they produce enable doctors to treat many forms of cancer; an application that is experiencing significant growth. Accelerators are now a major presence in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries.   	  As can be seen from the number of advertisements that appear monthly in such Journals as Physics Today and the CERN Courier, there is a dearth of personnel trained in accelerator physics and related technology. The nation's need for advances in the areas mentioned above requires the training of next-generation accelerator physicists, to carry out accelerator R & D on the cutting-edge.    One such cutting edge project is based on the interest in using superconducting electron linacs with energy recovery as synchrotron radiation sources. Such energy recovery linacs (ERLs) would open new regimes of X-ray science because they are capable of producing ultra-brilliant X-ray beams, maintaining a very small source size  suitable for micro X-ray beams, and making very intense fast  X-ray pulses. Each of these characteristics would permit the execution of experiments that are not feasible with existing synchrotron sources. Many technical issues must be satisfactorily resolved before the potential of a full-scale ERL can be realised, including the generation of high average current, high-brightness electron beams; acceleration of these beams to suitable energies without unacceptable emittance degradation; stable and efficient operation of superconducting linear accelerators at very high gradients etc. Cornell University has proposed to resolve these issues by the construction of a prototype ERL. The intention is to then utilize the information that is learned from the prototype to propose the construction of a full-scale ERL light source. The purpose of this interdisciplinary proposal is to construct the first phase of that prototype."

These devices will use a unique interface based on the Internet, a common transfer protocol based  on IP and will be supported by ubiquitous wireless coverage.  However, the communication technology used today is inadequate to support this progress without generating a spiraling demand for bandwidth.  As bandwidth becomes a low-margin commodity, certain technological barriers need to be surpassed starting from the physical layer. Using the modulation paradigm that we refer to as \"linear precoding\" this project researches designs that allow high bit rate packet transmission over broadband frequency selective  time-varying channels.  The block transmission model in the linear precoding framework provides a very general setting to determine the optimal or most cost-effective multiple access technique for packet transmission. The outreach of this project is the development of physical layer solutions for packet transmission that: 1) minimize the overhead bandwidth dedicated to training, error correction coding and precoding jointly; 2) adapt to time-varying channels ; 3) can incorporate an arbitrary number of  transmit and receive antennas; 4) can support multiple access packet transmission, allowing different quality of service requirements in terms of rate, decoding delay and complexity. The mathematical framework of linear precoding is not only an useful tool for research but also for teaching, since it allows a unified description of the principles of wideband and high bit rate transmission, including schemes such as antenna diversity, spread spectrum and multicarrier transmissions as special cases."

Since the new B-Factories, PEP-II at Stanford and KEK-B at the Japanese National Laboratory for Accelerator Research, KEK, now have luminosities routinely exceeding that of CESR, this is a proposal to alter CESR for operation over the energy range 1.5 to 5.6 GeV per beam to provide CLEO with access to unique and important physics and to address some of the original goals of the CESR/CLEO program in a way complementary to the PEP and KEK machines. In addition to the particle physics program, it is proposed to continue a vigorous program of accelerator science and technology for the future. The Cornell University group proposes to continue a strong program in x-ray science at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source that, using synchrotron radiation from the CESR beams, has operated simultaneously with particle physics since the inception of CESR.  The program described herein will be complete in 2006. At that time it will be appropriate to cease using CESR for particle physics and to devote it largely to x-ray science and to some accelerator R&D measurements.    The funds are requested primarily to support operation of the CESR facility, support infrastructure for CLEO collaborators including operation of the laboratory computing facility, research by the Cornell portion of the CLEO collaboration, accelerator R&D, and related educational and outreach activities. The proposed particle physics program contains opportunities for original discovery, precision measurements for unique tests of the Standard Model and enabling measurements that will be necessary for analyzing data to be taken at the B-factories and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva. The program will begin with a year of Upsilon 1S, 2S and 3S resonance running.  For the majority of the operation, however, it is proposed to run at and near the charm resonances and above DsDs threshold. By exploiting capabilities that are unique to the charm energy region, CLEO measurements will explore a large set of critical weak and strong interaction phenomena, will extend and enable flavor physics worldwide and will lay the foundation for mastery of a non-perturbative, strongly interacting theory. This is essential for a full understanding of QCD, will quite likely be crucial for understanding new theories revealed by the next generation of frontier accelerators and will impact many fields beyond particle physics where strongly-coupled theories arise. During this period, the CESR/CLEO program will serve as an important vehicle for accelerator and detector R&D in support of the national and world particle physics programs to come. Because of its great flexibility, CESR is an excellent laboratory for studying the effects of non-linearities attending the use of strong wiggler magnets and space charge detuning in high-density beams, both important features of the damping rings planned for future linear colliders. Additionally, they propose continued R&D in the physics of superconducting radio frequency acceleration techniques. As a result of this R&D, the Energy Recovery Linac has been put forward as an ultra bright source of synchrotron radiation, capturing worldwide attention and interest.     To their routine training of science and engineering graduates and undergraduates in particle physics and accelerator science, they propose to add a professional degree MS program in accelerator science and technology. An education outreach coordinator has been added to enhance their K-12 outreach to local and inner city young people."

We will achieve this by combining new approaches for parallel graphics rendering with advanced, feature-level psychophysical models of human vision and new image representations.     Currently, the two extremes of image synthesis are physically-based rendering, where accurate simulation of light reflection gives faithful predictions of the appearance of scenes, and real-time rendering, where crude approximations to accurate simulation are tolerated to provide dynamic imagery at interactive rates. High-quality, physically accurate images incorporating indirect lighting, inter-reflections between surfaces, and color bleeding can take hours or even days to compute on today's workstations, and incremental improvements to the speed of rendering will not be enough to bridge the gap. We estimate that real-time simulations of global illumination for complex scenes might require 10 7 times more processing power than we have on multi-processor workstations today. This can only be achieved by taking a radically different approach to how we generate, encode, and display synthetic images, an approach that separates computation by light reflection components and is based on advanced psychophysical models of human vision and new image representations.    Low-cost, efficiently pipelined graphics accelerator boards have become extremely popular, but these architectures only process local illumination components, and thus cannot provide global illumination effects or guarantee physical accuracy. To address this shortcoming, we have developed new algorithms that exploit the speed of these accelerator boards for direct lighting while performing global illumination computations in parallel on clusters of off-the-shelf Intel microprocessors. We have reduced computation times from hours to minutes for complex environments, but for real-time image synthesis we need another four orders of magnitude speed-up.    To reach this goal, we must develop more advanced models of human visual perception.  Current perceptually-driven rendering methods are based on threshold models of human vision that predict the limits of our abilities to discriminate luminance contrasts, spatial patterns, motions, and colors, but provide no guidance for optimizing the order or precision of rendering operations. For our new perception oracles, we are developing higher-level visual models to monitor the importance of scene features such as shadows and reflections to perceived image quality. These new models will then drive the allocation of parallel computing resources as well as select appropriate algorithms to provide the \"steepest ascent\" solutions. New data structures for pictorial representation will incorporate illumination and contrast gradients as well as pixel-by-pixel intensities to ensure optimal display of physically accurate and perceptually indistinguishable solutions under all viewing conditions. These capabilities will extend the scientific, educational, and commercial application of graphical simulations into visually critical tasks where predictive reliability and speed are paramount."

Conceptual, technical, and computational developments are driving a major convergence among the biological, earth, and physical sciences. Over the next several decades, this disciplinary convergence will transform understanding of basic processes that control the stability and sustainability of natural environments. These insights will have extraordinary implications for the ability to predict and manage the effects of modern human activities on the structure and function of ecosystems across local, regional, and global scales. Such new knowledge is critical in planning for a safe, sustainable, and prosperous future. The IGERT project goals are to create an environment where researchers from ecology and evolutionary biology, biogeochemistry, environmental engineering, hydrology, environmental microbiology, and materials science come together to create novel interdisciplinary approaches to major questions in environmental science, and to train the next generation of leaders in this new interdisciplinary science. Emphasis will be on intellectual diversity and non-traditional pedagogies in training students across disciplinary boundaries, while deliberately enhancing connections with international and non-university partners. Workshop and seminar style learning will be employed, as well as active involvement of students in the management and implementation of the program. The intellectual foci will be the interaction of biological and physico-chemical controls on the cycling of metals and nutrients, especially terrestrial nitrogen; the role of microbiological processes in mediating biogeochemical cycling; and the effects of variation in genotype and phenotype on ecosystem functioning. Ultimately, the program will consider how complex behavior arises from the interaction of individually simple relationships in natural and managed ecosystems. Cornell University has outstanding resources in individual disciplines, and the IGERT program offers a unique opportunity to bring together many of these individual efforts into an integrated whole.    IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fifth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-one institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF."

CHESS is a unique national synchrotron radiation user facility that operates parasitically on the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), producing high energy X-rays from the 5 - 8 GeV electrons and positrons in the ring.  Since 1998, CHESS has hosted 2516 visits from investigators from all over the world to conduct research in a wide range of science and engineering disciplines in academia, industry, and government.  For example, CHESS has been used for investigations of the atomic structure, properties, and time-resolved behavior of electronic, structural, polymeric, and biological materials, protein and virus crystallography, environmental science, radiography of solids and fluids, and microelemental analyses.  CHESS is an incubator of new synchrotron science, people, methods, and instrumentation.  To date, 449 students have received Ph.D. degrees using data taken at CHESS.  In consequence, CHESS is a national resource for new beamline scientists.    X-rays are produced as byproducts from the acceleration of electrons to very high energies.  This occurs in the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), producing X-rays that are utilized by the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). This radiation can be used to determine the properties and time-resolved behavior of a wide range of electronic, structural, polymeric, and biological materials.  In addition, the X-rays can be used to determine the structures of proteins and viruses, for environmental science, and to obtain radiographs of solids and fluids.  Many of these pieces of information can be obtained in no other way.  For example, time-resolved X-ray images of pressurized fuel sprays have been obtained that may lead to significant improvements in engine performance.

Sparks and his students will focus on the magnitudes of these exchanges using studies at multiple scales, from the molecular-physiological with emphasis on mechanisms controlling exchanges, to the biogeochemical with emphasis on the mass balance of nitrogen cycles of ecosystems, to atmospheric nitrogen chemistry with emphasis on the reactivity and control over turnover times. This program will enable a new generation of Interdisciplinary scientists to be trained.     Reactive nitrogen compounds derive from natural soil driven processes, lightning, emission from fertilizer application, and industrial sources and are of particular interest for three reasons. First, at high concentrations reactive oxidized nitrogen is known to be toxic to plants, although at lower concentrations such compounds have been shown to act as an \"atmospheric fertilizer.\" Second, direct input of nitrogen through leaves into plants is not normally considered by ecologists, while it is conceivable that this could result in both short and long-term effects on photosynthesis, changes in litter quality, and changes in carbon and nitrogen allocation patterns within plants. Finally, nitrogen oxides play a central role in controlling the chemistry of the lower atmosphere by catalyzing the formation of ozone.     Sparks will investigate the molecular and physiological mechanisms of foliar nitrogen uptake, quantify the magnitude and controls over canopy-level flux of reactive nitrogen over a range of ecosystems, and support the development of both regional and global biogeochemistry and air-quality models. Additionally, he will implement a two-phase education plan aimed at recruiting and training young scientists. He will first develop a web-based educational platform supported by the Cornell Adult University aimed at recruiting prospective students to the field. He then will support training of young scientists through participation in his research and participation in the Biosphere-Atmosphere Research Training program at the University of Michigan Biological Station.     Making linkages between gene expression and biogeochemical processes, as will occur under this award, is a very important part of the future of ecosystem science and a suitably lofty goal as a theme for the early career development of this young scientist."

Designing everyday computing applications that are appropriate for everyday life requires rethinking and adapting our methodologies; otherwise, we risk making all of our life like work.  In this project, the PI will exploit cultural theory to analyze the cultural context of everyday life and develop appropriate computer science technologies and methodologies that support open-ended activity, user reflection, variations in style of living, personal meaning, and everyday values.  These themes will be studied within the context of three applications: a system that monitors a home's emotional climate and provides users with open-ended feedback about it; information appliances for the home that support awareness of consumption; and an affective wearable device that explores emotional issues in backpacking.  The project integrates activities across the disciplines that make up Cornell's new Information Science program, and supports the consolidation of the currently fragmented interdisciplinary community of researchers working in this area.  It will also educate students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to integrate technical and cultural perspectives through interdisciplinary courses and involvement in the PI's research."

In particular he will study necessary conditions for  unitarity. He will also continue the study of unipotent  representations, in particular their associated cycles. Joint with   various coworkers he will study occurences of representations in the  dual reductive pairs correspondence, and for p-adic groups he will  study the Bernstein center. Birgit Speh, together with  various coworkers, will continue the study of cohomology of locally symmetric  spaces. In particular she will study representation theoretic  descriptions of modular symbols. She will also work on proving   uniform convergence of terms in the Arthur-Selberg trace formula.   It is expected that the results of this proposal   will contribute significantly to the understanding of the geometry and   topology of locally symmetric spaces. Graduate and undergraduate students   as well as postdoctoral faculty are expected to be involved in studying   problems generated by this research.      Many problems in number theory and mathematical physics are concerned  with functions that are solutions to differential equations which have  certain symmetry properties. These properties are expressed in  mathematics as saying that the solutions form a unitary representation  of a reductive group. A major part of this proposal is concerned with the  determination of the building blocks which are called  unitary irreducible representations. The aforementioned functions  relevant to number theory are called automorphic functions and have  expansions in terms of  unitary irreducible representations. These  expansions can be thought of as generalizations of classical Fourier  series.  The problem of convergence of these expansions is important  for applications to number theory, and forms an important  component  of this proposal."

This basic deficiency pseudo-distance (or Delta-distance) is well known; it generalizes the concept of sufficiency: if experiments are equivalent via sufficiency then their Delta-distance is zero. The idea of data reduction which is at the heart of the concept of sufficient statistics can be combined with limit theorems of probability, resulting in an approximation of general statistical models by Gaussian location or Poisson families. These families allow explicit expressions for risk bounds in many instances, and these risk bounds then become valid in an asymptotic sense in the approximated models. It is proposed to extend the scope of  approximations for nonparametric experiments of independent data from Gaussian to infinitely divisible experiments, including the Poisson case. Furthermore, a class of stochastic process experiments will be studied with regard to asymptotic equivalence. More insight is also sought into the connections to statistical information theory, and in a longer term perspective, to other topics in statistical inference which seem mathematically challenging such as e.g. differential geometry of probability measures and quantum statistics.     Thus the principle is to approximate a given statistical model by another which is better known or more tractable. In the widest sense, this is related to the familiar approximation of the mean of a simple random sample by a normal or Z-distribution (also known as Bell curve), taught in elementary statistics courses, but complex mathematical problems arise when one has to deal with data or parameters of very high or even infinite dimension. Two Ph. D. students will be constantly associated to the project; the aim is to educate young statisticians with distinctly mathematical interests who promise to be future leaders in academic research. This project is anchored in a mathematics department that has a major research tradition in statistics."

The experimental system is using Leptothrix discophora as a model Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium and Tetrahymena pyriformis as a model protozoan predator.  Experimental control include the use of solutions in which metal speciation can be determined, permitting a mechanistic interpretation of the coupled fate of transition metals (Cu and Pb) added to the experimental system and development of appropriate predictive models. The research is employing a chemostat-type bioreactor system in which control is maintained over physical conditions (e.g., Reynolds number, and hydraulic retention time), chemical conditions (e.g., medium composition, toxic metal speciation, pH, O2 level) and biological properties (via use of defined cultures). The controlled laboratory conditions is facilitating the investigation of a number of factors that are expected to influence Mn(II) oxidation and metal bioaccumulation, including: 1) the rate of bacterial production of the extracellular enzymes responsible for Mn(II) oxidation subject to the constraints of nutrient concentrations and the concentration of essential metal ions (e.g., Cu and possibly Fe) that may be required for formation of active enzymes; 2) the influence of Mn oxide coatings on bacterial consumption by predators and the fate of Mn oxides that are ingested; 3) the bioaccumulation/ biomobilization ofMn oxide-bound Pb and extracellular Cu associated with the multicopper oxidase enzymes thought to be responsible for Mn(II) oxidation as well as the Cu adsorbed to the hydrous Mn oxides formed through the activity of the enzyme."

The project has four main conceptual elements:  (i) 3-component bilayer lipid mixtures serve as models for the outer and the inner leaflets of mammalian plasma membranes.  These 3-component mixtures are sufficiently complex to model real biomembranes, yet are chemically well-defined; (ii) Several independent, complementary methods are used to thoroughly map and characterize the compositional phase behavior of these model membranes; (iii) Real biomembranes are asymmetric: model bilayers that are also asymmetric will be studied in order to bridge the gap between the chemically-simple models and real biomembranes; (iv) Behavior of the plasma membranes of living cells, including the nature membrane rafts, will be investigated by the methods developed in the model systems and analyzed in terms of the phase diagrams obtained for the model systems.  Experimentally, this work involves large data sets of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and perylene excimer/monomer measurements to find the lipid phase boundaries and the partition behavior of fluorescent probes.  Confocal fluorescence microscopy will be used to visualize and identify coexisting phases.  New procedures will be developed in order to prepare asymmetric lipid bilayers.    Cholesterol is the single most abundant lipid species in mammalian plasma membranes.  Nonetheless, the way cholesterol interacts with neighboring membrane molecules has remained obscure.  Cholesterol is known to mix nonrandomly with other membrane lipids, and yet in most cases a clear understanding is missing for the lateral distribution of cholesterol, and the way cholesterol influences the lateral distribution of other membrane components.  A current picture of nonrandom mixing in biomembranes, the \"raft model\" of cholesterol-rich patches floating within a cholesterol-poor bilayer, is likely to be improved by this research project.   In addition, in order to promote scientific education and training, a group of undergraduate students will receive lectures in lipid physical chemistry and fluorescence spectroscopy, followed by systematic training in lipid analytical chemistry, lipid organic synthesis, and spectroscopic and microscope techniques, which they will then use in their assigned independent research."

These networks grow and evolve through interactions of large numbers  of participants, yielding complex global structure and dynamics.  Often this leads to systems that function efficiently and reliably;  but in other, seemingly similar settings, networks can exhibit latent  inefficiency or cascading failures.  Such failures occur not only in  physical networks but also in social ones, as illustrated by recent  financial crises which propagated through networks of relationships and trust.  Despite considerable interest in these topics, the research community  is only beginning to understand the behavior of networks such as  these; small variations in the incentives, information, and  computational power possessed by the agents in a network can have  profound effects on network behavior, yet the principles underlying  these effects remain elusive.      This project develops theoretical and algorithmic underpinnings of networks  that arise from the interaction of strategic agents.  By combining  game-theoretic approaches with computational models of interacting  agents, the work develops models that are richer and  more informative than either those that consider strategic agents in  the absence of interaction networks or those that consider network  structure in the absence of game-theoretic models of the agents.  Networks of strategic agents are investigated at several different levels,   extending from questions of structure to those of function and behavior.    One of the project's central goals is to examine the  inter-relationships between these three levels.  In contrast, most  current techniques are tuned to a single level in isolation, with  work in computer science and mathematics focusing primarily on structure   and work in economics emphasizing strategic behavior.    The project's inter-disciplinary nature exposes similarities between  questions in communication networks, including the Internet, and  those arising in social networks, such as trust in markets.    Beyond analyzing questions arising from these networks in general,  a particular goal is to better understand the  networks of interactions underlying electronic markets.    Indeed, while it was widely predicted that such marketplaces would   revolutionize trading of goods and services, very few have survived.    The project participants contribute expertise from several perspectives.    They have made some of the fundamental contributions to  algorithmic game theory, computational and economic analysis of  interacting agents, and models for complex networks, as well as to the  understanding of market microstructure and the design of electronic markets.    Further, the investigators have been key participants in   the new Information Science program at Cornell.    This program seeks to broaden the reach of computational  ideas by attracting students from non-technical backgrounds, and  incorporating notions of computation as a human-centered activity  that is intrinsically embedded in social, legal, and economic contexts.    The scientific results of the project support  the intellectual underpinnings of this program at both  the graduate and undergraduate levels.  Many of the models involved in the research have an immediate intuitive   appeal, and are well suited to interactive graphical demonstrations.  These demonstrations can be used to broaden general understanding   of the nature of strategic interaction and its networked character,   and can be made broadly available through the National Science Digital Library   (NSDL) where appropriate to pre-collegiate educational levels.    The Internet is but the newest of many networks of strategic agents.  However, it has served to change the structure and function of other  networks, as it enables instantaneous, always-on, global communication.    Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of these  changes can provide important societal benefits in terms of more  secure, stable communication and economic systems."

The inability to use traditional methods of disease management in marine systems (culling, vaccination, quarantine) adds urgency to understanding and controlling disease in the ocean. The most practical remediation for coral disease is to control inputs and spread. Yet, we do not know the origin of any coral pathogen nor do we understand mechanisms of transmission.   The aspergillus - sea fan coral epizootic is an excellent model system for testing hypotheses about the origins of emergent marine disease, the relative importance of transmission and resistance in outbreaks and particularly the role of environmental facilitators. In this project, researchers at Cornell University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of South Carolina, and the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute will investigate this system through a research program combining linked experimental and theoretical approaches. The objectives are     (1) to determine the origins of the aspergillosis outbreak in sea fans, using  microsatellite markers;  (2) to evaluate the role of host resistance through development of immunological  assays;  (3) to evaluate experimentally the role of environmental facilitators in the  outbreak;  (4) to assess demographic and spatial determinants of infection risk; and  (5) to  develop a predictive theory of disease outbreak and spread through a spatial  model for spread of disease in coral populations, embedded in an agent- based framework.

The addition of environmental sensors to animal tags provides the capacity to monitor ecological and oceanographic processes, and the animals can be viewed as self- sustaining autonomous vehicles that focus sampling effort on regions of biological interest.  Although some scenarios permit recovery of the tags, a much broader domain of applications requires telemetry of data from the tags, usually using radio frequency signals.  Radio tags confront conflicting demands: minimization of transmit power to enable extended operations with small batteries, and maximization of the area over which the tags can be tracked.  	In the current systems for marine animal (e.g., whales) data acquisition, the attached (implanted) radio tags measure data about the animals and their environments and store the data in memory as packets.  When the animal surfaces in view of a satellite, this data is transmitted to the satellite where the biologist can retrieve it.  Once the packet is transmitted to the satellite, it may be deleted from storage on the animal-implanted device.  The devices on animals transmit at preset intervals to the satellite.    	However, the use of the satellite system accepts certain limitations: substantial transmission power requirements, high cost, and probable limits on connections, because satellites may not always be in view.  The last problem may prove serious if the tags cannot transmit at any time.  Many marine mammal species have dive durations exceeding 30 minutes, and may spend less than 15% of their time on the surface.  Moreover, the cost and energy consumption are critical issues due to the low battery power of the implants.    	In this proposal, the proposer advocate a different approach: the infrastructure is extended to the animals (mobile nodes) by the mobile nodes themselves, by creating a sensor network infrastructure composed of the animal tags.  The information that is created in a network node is allowed to be diffused (replicated) among the nodes, as the nodes come into contact due to their mobility.  In other words, as a node comes into reception distance from another node, the information stored in the memory of the node is replicated and stored in the memory of the recipient node.  An information collecting station is placed within the animal habitat, and when an animal comes within the reception range if a collecting station, all stored information in the memory of that animal tag is offloaded to the collecting station.   To increase the probability that the information is recovered from the network, a number of collecting stations can be distributed throughout the habitat.  Thus, only one of each information piece needs to reach only one collecting station to be successfully offloaded.  The propoer term this networking model the Ad Hoc Infostation model.    	As part of the research, it propose to address three areas: research into the design and performance evaluation of the Ad Hoc Infostation model, development of a practical sensor tag that would operate in a network of Ad Hoc Infostations, and integration of the sensor tag into a network of Ad Hoc Infostations.  	In particular, examples of topics  address under the first area include design of the network of Ad Hoc Infostations to reach the terrestrial network, networks that include a hierarchy of different-mobility nodes, such as those that include mobile Ad Hoc Infostations, and examination of the \"capacity-delay\" tradeoff offered by the Ad Hoc Infostation model.  In their work, plan on using the vast knowledge in epidemic modeling to leverage from in studying the Ad Hoc Infostation model.    	Under the second area, a new transceiver tag will be developed, which will support all of the RF capabilities needed for the wireless Ad Hoc Infostation networking nodes.    Under the third area, the tags and Ad Hoc Infostation receivers will be tested locally, and evaluated in two pilot projects to assess their biological utility.  Initial functional tests will be conducted by setting up Ad Hoc Infostations in the local Tompkins Country, and driving tags around to simulate animal movements.  The second project will utilize the networking capabilities to gather bioacoustic data from a matrix of dispersed fixed sensors.    	As the broader impact of the proposal, whales and other marine mammals are crucial to several marine environmental issues and improved understanding of the factors that enable prediction marine mammal distributions, and of the responses of marine mammals to anthropogenic noise, is a long0term research priority of naval research.  Also, NSF has proposed a National Environmental Observation Network, a 10 year $120M program.  Two of the proposed 12 sites have been earmarked for funding in the President's proposed budget.  Our proposed system could implement a heterogeneous network of stationary instruments, relatively sedentary animals, and wide-ranging animals to efficiently transmit telemetry data from areas that are inaccessible or very difficult to access."

The research component of the program will be organized around interdisciplinary groups (IRTG) comprising faculty with expertise in theoretical, computational and empirical science, who will jointly mentor graduate student fellow projects. The research areas of the initial IRTG, including areas of applications, are (i) networks (social networks, gene networks, internet, electric power grid); (ii) gene regulation (cell signaling and gene expression networks); (iii) moving machines and organisms (manual dexterity and control of locomotion); and (iv) biological pattern formation (cardiac electrophysiology).    Nonlinear science has been a role model for interdisciplinary research. Principles arising from dynamical systems theory have revealed common features in seemingly unrelated phenomena across the breadth of science and engineering.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the extension of successful strategies employed in nonlinear dynamics to confront increasingly complex systems. A primary goal of the research is to understand how systems, especially those arising in the life sciences, can be more than the sum of their parts. For example, legged locomotion and manual dexterity will be studied through a combination of mechanical devices, observation of human and animal behavior and computer models. The broader impacts of this research will be in improving the performance of robots and the treatment of physical injuries. Another theme that will be explored is how network architecture influences dynamics of a system. The concept of small world networks, developed by the founder of this IGERT Program, Steve Strogatz and his students, has already influenced research on biological, social and communication networks. Applied to the internet, the results of this research facilitate efficient web searches. In general, the program will have broad impact in developing methods to predict the dynamics of complex systems, taking full account of underlying network structures and making extensive use of experimental data.     The primary mechanism of the IGERT program is the engagement of Ph.D. students in nonlinear systems research early in their studies. The program involves students in the conceptual phases of research, and it encourages faculty to develop long term collaborations, stimulated by their joint mentorship of students in the IRTG. The most direct impact of the program is in training a new generation of scientists with broad interests and expertise. In the words of a former IGERT fellow, \"graduate students who go through the IGERT program learn to speak the language of two or more fields with considerable fluency, and all students are introduced to a common mathematical foundation so that even those who do not share the language of a specific field can interact meaningfully.\"    IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In this sixth year of the program, awards are being made to institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF."

Nature takes advantage of the strong interactions between charged particles (e.g., the strong attraction of particles with opposite charges or repulsion of the ones with like charges), to control the shape and function of these nucleic acids. This research project uses x-ray scattering, a newly demonstrated experimental technique, to address fundamental questions about the interaction of positively charged counter-ions with negatively charged nucleic acids. To maintain electrical neutrality in solution, DNA is associated with positively charged partners ranging from small ions to large proteins.  Numerous biological processes, including gene regulation and DNA repair, are regulated by the interactions of DNA with charged molecules. These strong interactions are also exploited in the design of pharmaceuticals, small molecules that target and modify DNA. This importance of DNA-charge interactions provides strong motivation for fundamental studies of the properties of these systems.     This experimental project is designed to probe these interactions using model DNA systems. This work builds on recent experiments performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source in which anomalous small angle x-ray scattering was used to distinguish the scattering signature of a single ionic species (e.g. Rb counterions) from all other atoms/ions in a multi-component system (e.g. DNA in a solution of RbCl). These preliminary measurements enabled unprecedented, quantitative measurements of the spatial distributions of these counterions around the DNA.  This project will provide new data to rigorously test conflicting theoretical models of the pertinent interactions. The long-term goal of this project is to exploit this new technology to address biologically relevant questions, such as the role of charged ligands in facilitating attractive forces between DNA strands. This attraction is of fundamental importance to our understanding of how DNA is packaged and stored in our cells.      Broader Impacts:  This work will have impact in a number of arenas linked together by the theme of promoting interdisciplinary work to a wide audience.  The activities range from participation in K-12 outreach through the development of a program to establish a pipeline from predominantly female undergraduate institutions to the Applied Physics graduate program. A successful pilot version of this pipeline program will serve as a model for future efforts.   In addition, an Engineering Distribution course will be developed for Cornell undergraduates. The course focuses on interdisciplinary science by introducing important, current topics in molecular biology to students of engineering and physical sciences.  Research and Education will be integrated through this course by introducing three new modules. These modules are inspired by the proposed research program and leverage on Cornell's unique research facilities."

The difficulty of doing this illuminates the shortcomings in current knowledge about skin, hair, and cloth and how their physical properties produce the distinctive visual appearance of these materials. Across the board, the increasing quality of computer-generated images is limited by a fundamental unsolved problem: the efficient and accurate modeling of the properties of materials. This research addresses this problem by looking at materials in several ways: how they interact with light, how they change their shape and appearance as they move, and how human observers perceive them.    In a departure from much previous work on materials in graphics, this research program expands the definition of material properties from optical properties alone to include mechanical properties and their effects. Additionally, material appearance is considered in the context of human visual perception. These goals lead to three related paths of research:    1. Optics of materials. Light reflection is central to rendering materials and forms the core of this research: developing the fundamentals using a scientific approach progressing from measurements of real materials through analysis to models that are practical for rendering.    2. Mechanics of materials. Recognizing that optics and static geometry alone suffice only to represent rigid materials, this project broadens the definition of material properties to include the mechanical properties that create the distinctive shape and motion that are so important to the appearance of deformable materials.    3. Perception of materials. Rendering is about making images that will be viewed by human observers, and to achieve efficiency and quality it is critical to have a better understanding of how the human visual system interprets, classifies, and infers properties of materials"

In the past, the capabilities of CMOS processors have been limited internally by transistor density, power consumption, and speed. All of these characteristics have improved consistently with transistor scaling, governed empirically by Moore's Law. However, as CMOS feature sizes decrease into the sub-micron regime, electrical signaling and interconnect problems promise to become the ultimate limit of high performance systems at both the board and chip levels. Integration of optical interconnects into high-performance computing offers a promising and necessary approach to solving the inter-chip communication bottleneck.    The goal of this project is to provide a framework for design of short distance chip-to-chip optical interconnects that addresses the unique problems and requirements of these microelectronic systems. Through research in the field of chip-to-chip optical interconnect design, I have found that existing models for optical interconnects in large scale networks fail when applied to small chip-scale networks.   By performing analysis tailored to smaller chip scales and integrating these new approaches with usable modeling tools, we will enable optical interconnects to be added into the design catalog of mainstream CMOS designers.  In order to achieve this we propose a two-pronged research plan composed of both investigation and development of feasible high speed interconnects.  A goal of the first part of the proposed research is to develop a methodology for interconnect optimization by performing a comparative analysis and testing of various interconnect architectures, as they would be applied in a multi-chip module (MCM).  In the second segment of this project, we will develop the framework for CAD supportable models of short distance optical interconnects, standard CMOS cell libraries for optical interconnect, and a set of simple design rules applicable to optimized short distance interconnect design.  The results of this work with be both a better understanding of use of hybrid technologies to solve scaling problems in CMOS systems as well as a demonstrated physical means of carrying out this type of design within a computational CMOS architecture.    The educational aspect of this project focuses on integrating research into teaching and other educational activities at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. A crucial step in removing barriers to innovation by students and future designers is to educate them in hands-on interdisciplinary research and allow them to develop and test novel design methodologies. In following with this idea, a third goal of this work is to engage students at all levels by providing them with \"hands on\" design experiences and exposure to research that develops both critical thinking and laboratory skills. This project provides many opportunities for students of VLSI design to practice hands on learning and develop critical thinking skills both in the laboratory and in the classroom environments."

The goals of the proposed research are to develop semiconductor modelocked lasers that can produce stable optical pulses shorter than 50 fs with pulse energies larger than 100 pJs. These goals will be accomplished through a synthesis of ideas from nanotechnology, ultrafast optics, material science, and device physics, such as a) quantum dot gain mediums to achieve wide gain bandwidth, zero chirp, and zero group velocity dispersion all at the same time, b) ultrafast devices based on intersubband transitions in nanostructures for generating stable ultrashort pulses with high pulse energies, and c) soliton-like pulse shaping mechanisms using artificially created Kerr nonlinearities in semiconductor nanostructures. In addition, fundamental aspects of ultrashort pulse generation in semiconductor lasers will be explored both theoretically and experimentally including issues related to pulse stability and noise, ultrafast carrier dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures, and pulse shaping mechanisms in the sub-100 fs regime where pulse widths are of the same order as the carrier intraband relaxation times in semiconductors.

Although languages differ in how they describe spatial events, young children display little difficulty acquiring the semantic categories that are specific to their language. For example, English-learning toddlers learn to map the English preposition \"in\" onto all types of containment events, for example, placing a peg in a block.  Korean-learning toddlers correctly learn to map the Korean spatial verb, \"kkita,\" onto tight-fit containment as well as tight-fit support events, for example, putting a peg in a block made to fit and a Lego block on another Lego block.  Hence, by their second birthday, toddlers have begun to acquire language-specific semantic spatial categories, attending to those spatial relations (e.g., tight-fit) that are lexically are relevant to their language.   When and how do infants and toddlers acquire the concept of containment described in the English term \"in\" or the concept of tight-fit described in the Korean term \"kkita\"? Are language-specific semantic categories drawn from infants' nonlinguistic spatial categories, for example, the result of infants' nonlinguistic processing of their spatial world? Or are the concepts expressed in semantic spatial categories instead acquired as the result of experience with a particular language? The current research project is designed to address these questions. A multifaceted, multi-methodological approach is taken to explore aspects of infants' and toddlers' perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic development. Specifically, the research program explores the role of nonlinguistic spatial cognition in the acquisition of language-specific semantic spatial categories by exploring the types of spatial categories formed by infants within different linguistic environments. The research program explores the possible role of linguistic input in the formation of language-specific semantic categories by documenting whether language can motivate infants to form nonlinguistic and semantic spatial categories. The research also examines the early acquisition of spatial language in infants and toddlers from different linguistic environments. The results are expected to advance our understanding of the processes guiding infant categorization and toddlers' early linguistic development. The results also will address how development may vary in infants and toddlers raised with languages other than English.   The research program is integrated with an educational program in which students from underrepresented minorities will be recruited to help conduct the research, especially those who have first-hand experience negotiating two languages and who can provide an insider's perspective on the language-thought issues being explored. Because a number of different methodologies will be employed, students will gain expertise in the use of a diverse array of methods, such as visual habituation, preferential-looking, action-imitation tasks, and act-out comprehension, as well as an understanding of the different data yielded by each methodology. The goal of this education program is to provide the field with independent researchers from underrepresented minorities who will seek academic positions, contribute to the field as scientists and educators, and function as mentors and role models for other students from underrepresented minorities."

They plan to use the recently developed soft-collinear effective theory and QCD factorization to study processes of great importance in heavy-flavor phenomenology. Ultimately, both of these studies should lead us to a more precise determination of the fundamental mixing parameters in the quark sector.

This infrastructure will be shared among several research projects, each of which has a temporary need for large amounts of online storage when processing raw data, but has reduced storage requirements when operating on processed data. Computer Graphics: The PIs will perform precise measurement of the light scattering properties of objects. This will be the most accurate study of this kind ever undertaken, and will lead to a new generation of multidimensional, multi-object graphical rendering techniques. The World Wide Web: The PIs will perform studies measuring and quantifying the evolution of the World Wide Web. Until now, the sheer scale of the Web constrained reported studies of the Web to be performed exactly once. The new large-scale storage facility will enable the PIs to analyze multiple independent snapshots of the Web, to develop precise models for how the Web evolves over time. Astronomy: The PIs will store and analyze data from the newly upgraded Arecibo radio telescope, leading to discovery of new pulsars, including pulsars with millisecond spin periods and those in binary orbits with other neutron stars or black holes. The pulsar data will provide opportunities for research on the equation of state of nuclear matter, gravitation physics, gravitational waves, stellar evolution, relativistic plasma physics, and the magnetized, ionized gas in the Milky Way. The storage system will be hosted at the Cornell Theory Center. Analyzed data products from all projects will be made available over the Internet. Raw data will be shared with researchers throughout the U.S., either through visits to the Cornell Theory Center or by shipping data sets on disk drives.    Broader Impact.  The PIs have concrete plans for coupling the research with educational activities at all levels, as well as for general public outreach. The CURIE Academy: The PIs will develop novel projects for the Cornell CURIE Academy, a one-week summer engineering immersion experience for high school girls. The first CURIE project will use data obtained with the facility to illustrate fundamental principles of optics and computer graphics.    Undergraduate Education: The work will impact undergraduate education in three different ways: (1) Several undergraduate courses are being adapted to make use of Web and astronomical data that will be available through the facility; (2) Cornell undergraduates will be invited to participate in supervised research related to the facility; and (3) The PIs will increase their interaction with Smith College, an undergraduate women's college in Massachusetts.    Graduate Education: The facility will naturally provide opportunities for Ph.D. level research. In addition, several graduate courses are planning to address both the research being done on the facility and the general area of data-intensive computing. Public Outreach: The PIs research will be displayed in SciCentr, a virtual science museum run by the Cornell Theory Center accessible on the Web at www.SciCentr.org. SciCentr received museum accreditation through the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) in May 2004. The PIs will develop a SciCentr exhibition for each research project associated with the new facility."

The aim is to understand the dynamics governing creation of these structures, as well as to invent enabling technologies that will allow inexpensive fabrication of large areas of such nanostructures without the use of traditional photolithography. In a first application we will engineer the surfaces towards integration of biomolecules, i.e., to match the natural spacing of an antibody. The team consists of B. Baird, D. Muller, S. Gruner, C. Ober (collaborator), M. Thompson, and U. Wiesner. This work falls into the NSF research and education themes \"Nanoscale Structures, Novel Phenomena, and Quantum Control\" and (to a lesser extend) \"Nanoscale Devices and System Architecture\".   Intellectual merit of the proposed activity  Understanding nanostructured thin film formation and nanopillar array formation including the effects of surface wetting and crystal growth in small dimensions will have impact on many areas of nanotechnology. If successful we will enable technologies for the inexpensive fabrication of large areas of such nanostructures without the use of traditional photolithography. This will open up the field to many which currently don't have access to such expensive facilities. Furthermore, engineering the surface structure of a synthetic material towards the molecular architecture of a biomolecule constitutes a powerful paradigm for nanobiotechnology and may lead to completely novel ways of organizing, e.g., proteins on solid substrates for analysis and detection. Cornell is uniquely positioned to make advances in this field and the program will make effective use of Cornell facilities such as the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) as well as facilities of the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) and the Nanobiotechnology Center (NBTC).  Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity   Through the collaborative environment with activities ranging from organic synthesis to materials characterization to biology we will promote a way of teaching, training, and learning and thus a unique educational experience for postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students not frequently obtained. We will also involve other components of training and development of human resources including the participation of underrepresented groups, efforts to enhance the infrastructure for research and education, and industrial outreach. To this end we intend to work with the excellent and proven platforms provided by the NSF funded Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) and Nanobiotechnology Center (NBTC).

It will result in the largest images in 12CO and 13CO of a molecular cloud yet obtained. This project will also produce the first fully sampled high angular resolution map of atomic hydrogen in the 100 square degree region. The combination of the atomic and molecular data sets will, in conjunction with existing data on the dust distribution and young stars in Taurus, provide a unique tool for studying key aspects of the life cycle of molecular clouds and star formation.  Acquiring the data to address these important questions is only possible due to recent developments in radio astronomical imaging technology. The molecular maps will be obtained using the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 13.7m telescope and 32 element Sequoia focal plane array: observing time has already been allocated. The HI data will be obtained using the 305m Arecibo telescope and the 7 element dual polarization ALFA focal plane array system. Prior to the availability of these instruments which provide an order of magnitude increase in  mapping speed, it was not realistic to cover the required solid angle with the angular resolution needed to be sensitive to structure over a range of scales exceeding 100:1. The greatly enhanced capability permits this project to address the following key questions.  1. The relationship between the atomic and molecular components of Taurus, including the evolutionary history of the region, will be addressed by comparing the hydrogen emission and absorption line profiles  and column densities, and by determining the ages of cloud cores from their residual atomic gas content;  2. The role of turbulence in dark cloud complexes -- both in the atomic/molecular transition and in the formation of new stars -- will be studied by the Dr. Goldsmith and collaborators through identification of critical scales for turbulent support based on Principal Component Analysis; 3. Critical parameters for star formation, including the threshold of column density and/or density, the association between molecular clouds and stars, and the role of large scale processes versus local effects in star formation will be identified; 4. The impact of young stars on molecular clouds and subsequent star formation will be evaluated by carrying out a complete census of molecular outflows, the energy that they have returned to molecular clouds, and their effect on cloud structure.     This work will have an impact on a wide range of areas in astrophysics and star formation research, especially (1) numerical simulations of atomic and molecular cloud hydrodynamics including the transition between these two key phases; (2) time dependent astrochemistry based on gas phase reactions and grain surface formation of molecular hydrogen; (3) the overall energetics of molecular clouds including dissipation and regeneration of turbulence.  This work will integrate research and teaching. Various portions of the data will be ideal for investigation by undergraduate students.  Inasmuch as the formation of solar type stars is of considerable interest to the public, and that this kind of mapping project really does produce images to which people can relate, it is ideally suited for both talks and to be the focus of exhibits being contemplated for local science education facilities."

A unifying principle is that most of the problems we study involve the global  algebraic and geometric properties of rings of differential operators. The complex Weyl algebra A1  (defined by the relation [p; q] = ih) is the prototypical example of such a ring which will be of special concern in the present project. It is perhaps the simplest and the most important example of a noncommutative algebra that finds applications in many areas of mathematics, physics and natural sciences. (For example, it plays a fundamental role in quantum mechanics underlying the famous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.) His work so far has obtained essentially new results about this algebra. These mostly concern the structure of projective modules (ideals) and the automorphism group of A1. In the proposed research we intend to address still deeper questions about A1 and to give generalizations of our results, especially to higher dimensions. The mathematical results sought in the main part of the project are motivated by and applied to the theory of wave propagation which is one of the fundamental problems in classical mathematical physics. Of special interest (both from practical and theoretical point of view) is the question of when the waves may propagate without diffusion to allow the possibility of transmitting `clean-cut' (sharp) signals. Well studied in homogeneous spaces this question remains wide open in general. One of the goals of this project is to develop new mathematical tools and techniques to investigate this difficult problem in inhomogeneous and anisotropic media. The results sought in this direction are of fundamental interest and significance in mathematical theory of wave propagation and may have applications in related physical disciplines including the theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space communication technologies, magnetohydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc. As a broader impact, it is expected that the interdisciplinary nature of this work will stimulate communication and collaboration between specialists in the various areas involved, as indeed this work so far has already begun to do.

The Eurasian plate and the South China Sea have been moving to the SE wrt the Philippine Sea plate, with oceanic lithosphere of the southeast China continental margin subducting beneath the Luzon arc, which sits atop the Philippine Sea plate.  Around 4 Ma ago, the margin of Eurasia entered the subduction zone, resulting in collisional orogeny that formed Taiwan.  Taiwan consists of parallel belts representing 7 different tectonostratigraphic provinces.  The collision is occurring at an oblique angle, with the northern margin colliding first, so that mountains are forming in the North and propagating south.  This oblique collision allows spatial changes to be viewed as temporal evolution.    Arc accretion is arguably the most important mode of continent formation throughout the post-Archean Earth (perhaps even before).  Taiwan offers the possibility of studying these processes in the world's most active arc collision zone with a temporal view of how such collisions progress, due to the oblique nature of the collision as mentioned above.  The PIs put forward two end member hypotheses to be tested concerning what is happening to continental lithosphere during the collision:  1) It is subducted, with crust-mantle detachment causing crust to accrete while deeper lithosphere is subducted;  2)  It doesn't subduct, but jams up in the subduction zone, leading to continuous deformation resulting in thickening of the lithosphere.      The two end-member scenarios for what is happening to continental lithosphere during the collision provide special opportunities to investigate some of the most fundamental questions of mountain building:    -	Does continental subduction play a controlling role in arc-continent collision?  Is the Eurasian continental lithosphere subducting beneath Taiwan?  -	One of the fundamental issues in orogeny is mass balance.  How do factors such as erosion, crustal thickening, mantle flux, etc. interact quantitatively?  -	How did the orogen evolve through time?  -	How does surface kinematics relate to deep structure?  -	How does anisotropy vary in space, laterally and vertically?  Do the S-splitting directions change with depth?  Is the deformation of the orogen vertically coherent from surface to upper mantle?    To answer these questions the PIs will carry out an integrated geophysical imaging, earthquake recording and geodynamic research program to study the Taiwan orogeny.  By combining detailed 2-D studies along transects and 3-D images for the whole region, the orogen and its evolution can be characterized.   The data acquisition program includes broadband regional seismic and teleseismic recording, onshore-offshore and land refraction-reflection seismic transects, magnetotelluric sounding, petrophysics and gravity modeling.  The geometry of the plate interactions, the mode of crustal deformation, and the material properties will provide a new quantitative basis for geodynamic modeling.  The various datasets will be integrated into a geodynamic model which can be used to test conceptual models for mountain building.    The project will involve collaboration from six US institutions as well as collaboration and support from Taiwanese and Japanese groups.  There is also the distinct possibility of the participation of scientists from mainland China.  The educational impact of this project will be large, with more than 25 students from the participating institutions, US and foreign.  In addition, the \"Texas Teacher in the Field\" program would involve one high school teacher in recording earthquakes offshore Taiwan, developing related teaching modules for Texas high school teachers."

The overarching goal of the INDEPTH studies is to understand the basic processes that take place in a continent-continent collision.  INDEPTH I, II, and III were joint Sino-U.S. studies to understand the formation of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan mountains, which together comprise Earth's type example of an active continent-continent collision zone.  Results from these studies have profoundly influenced prevalent theories of mountain building in such tectonic settings.     The focus of INDEPTH IV is the northeastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau.  This boundary plays a central role in a contemporary debate concerning continental plateau formation as an intracontinental response to collisional orogeny.  Recent geological studies and limited geophysical measurements in this region have been cited to argue that a) uplift is due to internal imbricate \"stacking\" of Asian crust while b) Asian continental lithosphere is being detached and \"subducted\" into the Tibetan mantle.  Such models contrast with a competing paradigm, derived primarily from observations in the southern and eastern portions of the Plateau, that attribute plateau formation to ductile flow in the deep crust.  Critical to any model of surface tectonics is the mantle dynamics beneath the plateau and adjacent regions.  Upper mantle geophysical properties beneath the northern plateau have been variously attributed to delamination triggered by instability of a thickened lithosphere, mantle lid detachment and/or asthenospheric counterflow associated with subduction of Indian continental lithosphere.  INDEPTH IV will test key elements in these hypotheses with an integrated, focused program of geophysical surveys across three key segments of the NE Plateau boundary zone.      Geophysical surveys will consist of integrated seismic reflection, refraction and densely spaced passive seismic profiles, a detailed magnetotelluric survey, and a regional broadband seismic array.  Specific features to be investigated by the surveys include:   a)  the existence and nature of proposed Moho offsets;  b) the deep geometry of major thrust faults at the plateau boundary;  c) the relationship between major thrusts and strike slip faults;  d) constraints on lower crustal flow from structural continuity of crustal markers;  e) the existence and nature of subducting Asian lithosphere; and f)  the mode of lithospheric thickening beneath the plateau foreland."

In the context of a genetic linkage map, differentiated regions of the genome (regions in which gene flow between strains is low or absent) will be identified and characterized.  The importance of major genes that determine pheromone communication and life cycle will be evaluated as potential barriers to gene exchange.    ECB provides an exceptional model system for examining the genetic causes and consequences of reproductive isolation and how patterns of gene exchange vary with genome region.  Characterizing gene flow in natural populations is essential for understanding to what extent new variants will spread.  The fundamental observation that the amount of gene flow depends on genomic region has potentially profound implications, not only for control of ECB populations (which are major economic pests), but also in other contexts, e.g., with respect to the issue of hybridization between transgenic plants and their wild relatives and for conservation of threatened or endangered populations/species."

Drosophila will be collected from five locations around the globe for at least three consecutive years.  The diversity of bacteria pathogenizing these wild flies will be determined to discover whether a) there are differences among populations in bacterial prevalence and b) bacterial composition changes over time.  Simultaneously, genotypes of at least 20 important immune response genes will be obtained from each wild-caught fly a) to test for differences among fly populations and b) to assess in the field whether fly genotypes correlate with the absence/presence of specific bacteria (implying resistance/susceptibility to infection).      Immune responses are highly conserved among insects and the conclusions drawn from Drosophila experiments have direct application in other systems.  This study will contribute to an understanding of the ecology of insects and bacterial pathogens, currently poorly understood from a genetic perspective.  Observed adaptation of Drosophila to local pathogens may suggest the potential for evolution of resistance in pests to biological control mechanisms in agricultural fields."

Major nonlinear changes in the coupling of element cycles occur in these ecosystems as they receive increasing external N loads from anthropogenic changes in surrounding watersheds. Numerous biogeochemical feedbacks can accelerate eutrophication and aggravate some of its consequences including increased incidences of harmful algal blooms.     A consortium of researchers from Cornell University, University of Virginia and The Ecosystems Center in Woods Hole, Ma will take advantage of a whole-ecosystem \"experiment\" in which external N loading to a 79-hectare coastal system on Cape Cod, MA, will approximately double over the next 3-5 years, as a plume of N-polluted groundwater reaches the estuary. This \"experiment\" reflects the transition from low to moderate, and ultimately to high, nutrient loading, and spans the continuum of eutrophication stages within the ecosystem zones. A study of the recovery of the shallow portions of a severely eutrophied ecosystem (Boston Harbor) following diversion of wastewater offshore (N-loading decreased 10-fold in 2000) will also be continued. Process and flux measurements will focus on non-linear feedbacks and interactions among the cycles of N, C, P, O, S, Fe, Mn, and Si, along with the relationship of these cycles to biotic structure during different stages of eutrophication. Modeling at both the process and whole-system scales will integrate the research, and make the results accessible to the management community.      This research has a significant broader impact since N pollution (and the resulting eutrophication) is one of the greatest threats to the ecological integrity and functioning of coastal marine ecosystems, with two-thirds of coastal rivers and bays in the U.S. moderately or severely degraded from N pollution."

It also will improve the design and construction of lifelines affected   by  landslides,  mining,  extraction  of  subsurface  fluids,  and  underground  construction.  The  research   deliverables include, as a minimum: 1) systematic assessment of lifeline performance under permanent   ground deformation,  2)  quantification  of  serviceability  and  ultimate  limit  states  for  critical  lifelines,  3)   design guidelines, 4) experimental databases for benchmarking future numerical models and guiding the   evolution  of  numerical  simulations  for  soil-structure  interaction,  and  5)  validation  and  guidance  for   advanced materials as well as sensor and robotics deployment in underground conduits.      The research will be performed through physical modeling using the Cornell Large Displacement Soil-  Structure Interaction Facility for Lifeline Systems and the Rensselaer 150 g-ton Geotechnical Centrifuge   in combination with advanced computational simulation.  The 4-year program is organized according to a   matrix  management  approach  in  which  lifeline  response  to  a  comprehensive  suite  of  ground  rupture   patterns is systematically investigated and checked through large-scale experiments, centrifuge tests, and   numerical simulation.

Unlike most other cells, they must carry out their function without the ability to activate genes or synthesize proteins.  It is amazing to think that mammalian sperm can travel deep into the body of a female and fertilize eggs with only the shirts on their backs, so to speak.  How is this accomplished?  One behavior that enables sperm to reach the egg and fertilize it is called \"hyperactivation\".  The tails of hyperactivated sperm increase the amplitude of bending on one side.  It has been established that this bending pattern provides sperm with additional thrust for penetrating the vestments of the egg; however, it is also thought to assist sperm in reaching the egg.  This project has been designed to test whether hyperactivation is required to get sperm to the egg and to determine the mechanism that increases the tail bending.  Mutant mice whose sperm lack the ability to hyperactivate will be used to test whether hyperactivation enables sperm to advance towards the egg in the fallopian tube. The behavior of the mutant sperm within mated females will be compared with that of wild-type sperm.  This can be accomplished by placing the fallopian tubes on a microscope stage and looking through their transparent walls to chart the progress of the sperm within.  Next, in order to examine the mechanism controlling hyperactivation, the role of calcium will be investigated.  It has been established that calcium is required by sperm in order to hyperactivate. The objective will be to identify the type of membrane channel that enables calcium to enter sperm and switch on hyperactivation by employing pharmacological agents known to specifically block each type of calcium channel to see which agent prevents calcium influx and subsequent hyperactivation. The final objective of this project will be to identify which components of the tail interact with the protein calmodulin, which is the immediate target of calcium.  The merit of this project is that the results obtained should elucidate the function and regulation of hyperactivation, thereby increasing understanding of how mammalian sperm reach the egg to fertilize it. The educational impact will be on individual graduate and undergraduate students, including minority students, who will learn to perform and interpret experiments.  In addition, laboratory exercises on the regulation of sperm motility will be presented to high school and undergraduate classes."

The primary objective of the fleet management models is to make vehicle-to-load-assignment and vehicle-repositioning decisions, so that a performance measure, such as profit, deadhead miles or number of served loads, is optimized. However, a question that is commonly overlooked by these models is how the performance measure in question would change in response to changes in certain model parameters.  For example, freight carriers are interested in how much their profits would increase if they introduce an additional vehicle into the system or if they serve an additional load.  Railroad companies want to estimate the minimum number of railcars necessary to cover random shipper demands.  Ideas from approximate dynamic programming, infinitesimal perturbation analysis and combinatorial optimization will be utilized to build these \"sensitivity analysis\" algorithms, which will subsequently be used to make tactical decisions, such as fleet-sizing, pricing and terminal-capacity planning.    By and large, freight carriers use separate and uncoordinated models for their tactical and operational decisions.  This research will help them to coordinate their tactical and operational decisions better.  Currently, sensitivity analyses are carried out by time-consuming methods that involve \"physically\" adjusting the parameters and rerunning the models.  The developed sensitivity analysis algorithms will quickly point out the critical parameters to the decision makers, and thereby, increase the decision quality and efficiency.  Findings will also be used to build price-bidding policies for the freight-matching sites on the Internet, where the shippers post their loads to get price offers from the carriers. Finally, this work will contribute to the general theory of approximate dynamic programming and sensitivity analysis of stochastic control problems."

The overarching goal of HBR is to increase understanding of the ecological patterns and processes that characterize forested landscapes in the northeastern USA, particularly in response to disturbances. Three types of disturbances are examined: 1) air pollution, 2) catastrophic events (e.g., clear-cutting) and 3) non-catastrophic events (e.g., soil freezing events, ice storms and insect outbreaks).  Biogeochemical studies build on a 40-year record of element fluxes and vegetation dynamics in experimental watersheds, focused on construction of quantitative nutrient cycles. Long-term measurements, experiments and process studies are conducted at a variety of scales, ranging from small plots to entire watersheds and forests. Long-term experiments include a whole-watershed calcium fertilization study designed to offset soil Ca losses due to acidic deposition and to track calcium fluxes and cycling throughout the watershed, with particular emphasis on effects on currently declining sugar maple populations. Such experiments and ongoing process studies are to be coupled with new initiatives examining the effects of compounded disturbances on ecosystem structure and function, elemental stoichiometry and hystereses, all in the context of landscape-level variation in ecological state factors. New studies include 1) plot-level fertilization of young and mature forest with nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium, 2) intensive and extensive study of beech bark disease across multiple trophic levels, and 3) detailed study of nitrogen and carbon dynamics in relation to sugar maple decline, forest nutrition and productivity.     Broader Impacts. HBR research is crucially linked with the important societal issues of air pollution and the effects of atmospheric deposition on ecosystem processes. Key HBR scientists are active in regional and national outreach regarding air pollution, acid deposition and their ecological consequences. This outreach is expanded with HBR's generation of newsworthy scientific findings and the production of popularly accessible products. HBR is among the most productive LTER sites in terms of publications in high impact journals, influential synthesis products and theses/dissertations. The new conceptual framework is intended to guide HBR in the future and is likely to influence other LTER research as well. Research at this site has trained more than two generations of prominent ecosystem scientists and will continue this with the training of a high number of new undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs. HBR is actively increasing diversity and the participation of women in science, from the student level to the faculty level. Additional outreach includes the Schoolyard LTER program, public ecological tours and the innovative Science Links feature."

Pope, Cornell University  Peyman Givi, University of Pittsburgh      The focus of this collaborative ITR project is the development and use of innovative computational algorithms for the simulation of turbulent combustion. This is a topic of extreme intellectual challenge as it combines highly complex and non-linear combustion chemistry with the multi-scale and stochastic aspects of turbulence.  Addressing this challenge, the four components of the project are (1) Dimension Reduction Algorithms suitable for combustion chemistry (2) Storage-Retrieval Algorithms including the use of widely-distributed databases (3) Algorithm Implementation for efficient performance on large-scale parallel systems, and (4) performance of Turbulent Combustion Simulations. In combustion (and other applications) the computational cost can be dramatically decreased if the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced.  Two new approaches to dimension reduction are being explored and developed.  These are based on pre-image curves and iterated Taylor series. Storage-retrieval algorithms have proved extremely effective in turbulent combustion calculations, and there are many other applications ripe for their use.  The basis of these algorithms is to re-use data that are costly to compute directly (e.g., the solutions to the stiff ODE's governing chemical reactions).  Data generated early in a simulation are efficiently re-used later in the simulation.  This idea is extended to widely distributed computing and databases, so that data generated worldwide in all previous simulations can be used. To achieve accurate and efficient simulations of turbulent combustion, several advanced methodologies are combined: the flow is treated by large-eddy simulation (LES) so that the large-scale, unsteady, 3D motions are explicitly represented; the statistical distribution of the subgrid scale compositions is fully represented by its joint probability density function (PDF) whose evolution equation is solved by a Lagrangian particle method; and realistic combustion chemistry is incorporated using the combination of dimension reduction and storage-retrieval.  The objective of this aspect of the work is to develop a comprehensive implementation of these methodologies that performs efficiently on large-scale parallel systems. Finally, as part of an ongoing international collaborative workshop, simulations are performed for several \"target flames\" for which there exist high-quality experimental data.  In addition to testing and demonstrating the methodology developed, these simulations serve to investigate the performance of the physical sub-models, and to shed light on the physics and chemistry of the processes involved.     Now, and for many decades to come, turbulent combustion is a topic of tremendous significance to society and to several major industries. Energy usage (in power production, transportation, process industry and elsewhere) occurs predominantly through the combustion of fuels in turbulent flows. While there is, appropriately, great current interest in fuel cells and the possible re-emergence of nuclear power, the reality is that combustion technologies will remain dominant for many decades.  There are compelling reasons to seek improvements in combustion devices, environmental and economic, and the industry is looking increasingly to computer simulations as a means of achieving improved designs. Higher combustion efficiencies lead directly to reduced CO2 emissions (for given output); at the same time, lower emissions of pollutants such as NO and particulates are continually being sought. It is inevitable that computer simulation, already an integral part of the design process, will grow in importance, as computers continually increase in power and the fidelity of the simulations improves. In this project, computer algorithms are being developed to increase substantially our abilities to simulate combustion processes and hence to impact the design of improved combustion devices.  While the focus of the project is on turbulent combustion simulations, the algorithms developed (especially for dimension reduction and storage-retrieval) have broad applicability in computational science and engineering in general."

The model will be physically comprehensive, with total domain scales on the order of hundred's of kilometers, yet with a nearshore grid resolution less than a meter.  To include this great range of scales, a number of diverse hydrodynamic models, with various but overlapping physical and practical constraints, will be integrated to create a hybrid hydrodynamic software tool.  The method of interfacing the different hydrodynamic models will be founded in distributed computing techniques, thereby allowing for utilization of computer cluster resources. In addition, each of the individual models in the hybrid system will be parallelized, leading to the creation of a massively parallel and distributed simulation platform.  Coupled with the hybrid hydrodynamic model will be sediment transport formulations, such that morphological change in the nearshore (i.e. beach erosion) can be simulated.  These formulations will employ the fine resolution and high fidelity wave forcing from the hydrodynamic model, including the effects of strong turbulence in the breaker, surf, and swash zones.  Validation of the coupled model will use established datasets from field studies and controlled experiments. The technology infrastructure developed to pass information between the various coupled models will be transparent and expandable, such that as more sophisticated models become available, they may be plugged into the existing simulator.  The coupled simulator will be utilized by practicing engineers for design of coastal protection measures and by policy makers who may need better estimations of wave impact and erosion due to extreme events.  By influencing future design and policy decisions, the simulator will contribute towards the goal of sustainable coastal margins.  Education and outreach will be accomplished through the unveiling of a web-based, open access, coastal simulator.  The website will be completely free access, open to college and high school students, as well as academics and engineers. The coastal simulator will be used remotely for senior level coastal engineering design classes.  It would be of immense impact to be able to show these students first-hand the level of uncertainty and possible error in common engineering tools through comparison with the high accuracy model developed here, such that they are in a much better position to interpret the predictions when they become practicing engineers.

The RDC directors, administrators, board members and researchers, together with the Center for Economic Studies and the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program, constitute a collaborative research network that is building and supporting a secure distributed computer network that enables research that is critical to our economic and civic prosperity and security.  The network operates under physical security constraints dictated by Census and the Internal Revenue Service. The constraints essentially eliminate the possibility of distributing the computations to facilities outside of the Bureau's main computing facility. Instead, the researchers use the RDCs as supervised remote access facilities that provide a secure, encrypted connection to the RDC computing network.      This project addresses the technical and logistical issues raised by the creation, maintenance, and growth of the RDC network while maintaining the confidentiality guaranteed to participants in Census data.  The RDCs and LEHD will lead a new wave of research with the development of innovative, large-scale linked data products that integrate Census Bureau surveys, censuses and administrative records with data from state governments and surveys conducted by private institutions. Both CES and LEHD have extensive experience in creating these products. The RDC network researchers will enhance that experience and contribute their own expertise to the data linking research. The newly created data will be richer than any presently available to researchers with no increase in respondent burden. They will also raise complicated and vexing issues regarding disclosure avoidance and participant privacy.    The project also creates synthetic versions of these confidential data sets.  This will increase the accessibility of these data to social science researchers while preserving the confidentiality of private information. Synthetic and partially-synthetic data are new confidentiality protection techniques that rely on computationally intensive sampling from the posterior predictive distribution of the underlying confidential data. The result is micro-data that preserve important analytical properties of the original data and are, thus, inference-valid. The synthetic versions of confidential data are for public use. At the same time, ongoing research within the RDCs using the gold-standard confidential data will constantly test the quality of the synthesized data and allow for continuous improvement.  As a result a continuous feedback relationship will be established between the research activities conducted in RDCs on confidential Census Bureau data and the quality of the Bureau's public use data products-namely, the synthetic micro data created by these projects. In order to accomplish these computationally-intensive activities, as well as to allow researchers to engage in such innovative research as agent-based simulations and geo-spatial analysis, we will install a supercluster of SMP nodes optimized for the applications of creating linked data, analyzing the gold-standard data, and processing the data to produce multiply-synthesized public use data sets. Two industry partners, Intel and Unisys, have promised to directly support the creation of this supercluster by donating 256 Itanium 2 processors and providing the computing crossbars, cluster infrastructure, and disk storage arrays at manufacturer's cost. The Linux-based system will be integrated and tuned by the proposal team from Argonne National Laboratories. The synthetic data specialists on the proposal team will port existing multi-threaded data synthesizers and develop new ones.    Broader Impacts:  The research conducted in RDCs and at LEHD over the past decade has made important contributions to our understanding of essential social, economic, and environmental issues that would not have been possible without use of the confidential data accessible via the RDC network.

Second, they will develop novel data analysis methods targeted for analyzing abundance of wild bird populations across North America.  Their data mining approaches include ensemble learning, statistical smoothing, multi-task machine learning, and the estimation of change in abundance over time to quantify variation in spatio-temporal variation in abundance and to estimate the impact of environmental conditions. Third, they will make all data and analysis tools available online to allow browsing of bird-monitoring data. Fast response times are guaranteed through novel methods for approximate results to data-exploration queries.  In addition to advancing research both in computer science and population biology, they will expose advances in high performance computing and data analysis to new audiences, from biologists, conservation agencies, and land planners to school classrooms and through their website to the literally millions of people who watch and appreciate wild birds.

The PI has previously demonstrated algorithms based on statistical machine learning that allow reconstruction of a 3D object from a 2D freehand drawing directly.  By extending and combining this work with recent mass-market pen-based hardware, the PI will in this project create the basis of new conceptual design tools for rapid visualization, simulation and learning for geometry-intensive domains.  A new form of freehand sketching will be explored, in which the sketch itself is spatially reconstructed in interactive time and then can be physically simulated, a process the PI calls \"live sketching.\"  The PI's system will enable users to construct complex 3D models quickly and intuitively, to analyze them, to change viewpoints while sketching, and to communicate and collaborate on spatial concepts with other designers more easily.  To this end, the PI will first extend his reconstruction algorithms through context sensitivity and temporal scene segmentation so they can handle more complex geometries than is currently possible, including curved surfaces.  This effort will then be combined with existing simulation and analysis codes of various disciplines and will be integrated into a prototypical platform allowing construction of 3D models by successive piece-wise sketching, reconstruction, and interactive simulation.  The resulting tools will fundamentally alter the way engineers interact with design systems, bringing together traditional computer-aided engineering and simulation tools so they can play a role much earlier in the critical preliminary design stages.      Broader Impacts: The outcomes of this project will positively impact any design domain where it is necessary to predict the behavior of spatial geometries, including many application areas of mechanical, civil, MEMS, and architectural CAD.  Live sketching will also make engineering tools for modeling and simulation much more accessible to non-engineering designers, students and teachers, by removing interface barriers.  The PI will in addition develop and make available online a live sketch application for teaching structure and kinematics, which will allow students and teachers to explore and demonstrate kinematics and structural analysis of trusses and solid structures by sketching structures, applying loads, and seeing the resulting mechanism trajectories, exaggerated deformations, and colored stress concentration for various shapes, in real time while sketching.  This project will be made available on-line in open-source format, so that additional types of simulation can be integrated into it by others as required."

This investigation examines monitoring networks from the perspective of minimizing energy usage at all levels of abstraction: circuit, node architecture, signal  processing, communication, and networking. The overall goal is to develop technologies that enable sensor networks that have unprecedented longevity---on the order of years rather than days or weeks.    Research on node design focuses on the development of an ultra-low-power asynchronous microprocessor optimized for sensornetwork applications. Asynchronous circuits enable extremely fine-grained power management, and lead to a significant reduction in energy per operation as well as transition times between active and idle states. Research on communication and networking focuses on collaborative signal processing techniques. Nodes in the system cooperate at the physical layer, resulting in a simultaneous reduction  in the energy and latency required for information extraction.

This research aims to produce methods for constructing distributed systems that are trustworthy in the aggregate, even when some nodes in the system have been compromised by malicious attackers. The security and fault-tolerance communities have developed their own solutions to aspects of these problems, but the solutions are incompatible.  The goal of this project is to reconcile that incompatibility.  One key idea is to use automatic compile-time transformations to rewrite programs to run securely, even when some host machines are untrustworthy.  Code and data are transformed to synthesize distributed systems that, by construction, provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The planned research also includes new distributed computation techniques needed to make these transformations effective.  These techniques include proactive recovery, proactive obfuscation, and threshold cryptography, which can help systems survive malicious intrusions and denial of service attacks while offering data integrity, high availability, and cryptographic protection for secrets.  Gossip-based and epidemic communication algorithms can provide robust, scalable, and efficient information aggregration over a large distributed system. In summary, the plan is to combine new compile-time and run-time techniques to make distributed systems more trustworthy."

The primary objective of the proposal follows. The Finger Lakes Region of New York State, bounded by Syracuse to the east, Rochester to the west, and Ithaca to the south, is ready to emerge from its lagging economic development by exploiting the intellectual power resident in its many institutions of higher education and the strong desire to keep innovations arising from these institutions within the region. This is technology-based economic development. This proposal addresses the need by making a unique blend of disparate technologies that rarely meet, but have great potential to generate innovation when they do. The first set of technologies are agriculture and food, and is embodied in the translational research carried out by the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station which supports a wide range of research for the horticulture and food industries in New York State. The second technology set consists of photonics, microsystems and imaging, embodied by the industry-initiated Center of Infotonics Technology, a New York State Center for Excellence. Such a fusion will create innovation.    Potential Economic Impact    The proposed effort will create the support systems that insure this innovation will find a home within the region to anchor, be nurtured, and grow. This support consists of business and legal services for start-up businesses, capital funding sources for new ventures, commercialization support for new technologies, a well-prepared workforce to support the innovations, and a well-educated community that will welcome the businesses producing the innovations. Because there is region-wide excitement about technology-based economic development, with the creation of initial successes expected from this grant, the region will embrace sustained activity in technology fusion. The investigators will share our successful approach with other regions that want to replicate the success.    The intellectual merit of the project follows. This is a novel proposal to address the need for cross-institutional, cross-disciplinary research, fusing disparate technology areas to create innovation. It is a very aggressive partnership that is unified by the overall goal of community education and economic diversification.    The broader impacts of the activity follow. The impacts of this project are extensive -- covering rural populations, citizens (an oft neglected constituency!), high school teachers and administrators, community colleges, higher education, economic development organizations and all parts of the private sector. This proposal has the potential to affect a large physical area, large population and diverse population with an innovate approach to knowledge and technology fusion -- interdisciplinary work harnessed to create economic diversification opportunities."

This is a metabolically active process that creates within the phloem a very high concentration of nutrient, primarily sugar.  Water follows by osmosis, and since the cell walls are rigid, pressure rises.  The pressure, more than ten times that of an automobile tire, drives long-distance flow, just as the water pressure in a house drives water along a garden hose. Thus, loading is the motivating force for movement of nutrients, and is a direct determinate of agricultural yield.   Two, species-specific mechanisms of phloem loading are known.  In one, apoplastic loading, sucrose exits photosynthetic leaf cells and enters the cell wall space (apoplast).  It is then energetically pumped into phloem cells by transmembrane transporter proteins.  In the second loading mechanism, sucrose diffuses from its point of origin into the phloem, passing from cell to cell through narrow pores (plasmodesmata) that join them.  It may seem unlikely that a process based on diffusion could concentrate sugar in cells.  However, the hypothesis of this project is that this second system operates by \"polymer trapping.\"  According to this hypothesis, sucrose molecules in the phloem are converted to larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, that are unable to diffuse back through the plasmodesmata because of their size.  Sugar thus becomes concentrated, and the phloem pressure rises.  Many vigorously growing plants, such as pumpkins, use this system.  The polymer trap model is supported by several lines of evidence, including a strict correlation between extraordinarily high numbers of plasmodesmata in the phloem of certain species, and the transport of raffinose and stachyose.  However, further experimentation has been limited by the fact that none of these species has been known to be readily transformable with foreign DNA.  It was recently discovered that Verbascum phoeniceum, a raffinose/stachyose plant, can be easily transformed by standard techniques.  Hence, it has become possible to test the polymer trap model.  First, plants will be genetically engineered to produce yeast invertase in the apoplast.  Invertase degrades sucrose.  In apoplastic loaders, this treatment severely interferes with loading since the transporter proteins are specific for sucrose.  However, a prediction is that loading will not be compromised in V. phoeniceum since sucrose never enters the apoplast.  In the second set of experiments, sucrose transporter genes will be down regulated by RNA-interference technology.  Again, this treatment abolishes loading in apoplastic loaders but is predicted to have little affect in V. phoeniceum, since transporters are not involved.  In the third set of experiments, synthesis of raffinose and stachyose will be down regulated in V. phoeniceum.  The expectation here is that loading will be severely inhibited because the plant cannot make the sugars needed to trap carbohydrate in the phloem and there will be no way to generate pressure by osmosis.    Broader Impacts:  The PI places considerable emphasis on science writing for the mass media.  One of the PI's graduate students, Sarah Davidson, has begun a non-traditional, program of science communication within the traditional Field of Plant Biology and in collaboration with the Communication Department.  The intention is to pave a permanent, new track in graduate school that other students will follow.  Other recent articles from the PI's lab include an entry on phloem transport for MacMillan's reference encyclopedia \"Biology\" and a review article on phloem loading for BioScience, a journal widely read by biology teachers (in preparation)."

During senescence a leaf loses its photosynthetic capability. Leaf senescence thus limits crop yield and reduces the postharvest storage and shelf life of many vegetables. Nutrients such as vitamin C and proteins are also degraded during leaf senescence. In addition, a senescing tissue becomes more susceptible to pathogens, some of which may produce toxins. However, the mechanisms underlying leaf senescence are not well understood. The objective of this project is to utilize a newly developed innovative functional genetics approach called TASSEL (transposon-associated, senescence-specific enhancer-linked) activation tagging to identify senescence-suppressing genes or \"green genes\". In the TASSEL system, four copies of a senescence-specific enhancer are placed between the ends of the maize transposon Ds.  In the presence of transposase, the senescence enhancer-laden Ds element transposes to different sites within the plant genome.  At the onset of senescence, the senescence-specific enhancers will activate plant genes adjacent to the Ds insertion site. If the activation of a gene is sufficient to inhibit senescence, the affected cells will remain green, giving rise to a \"green island\", while the rest of the leaf becomes yellow. The activated \"green genes\" will be cloned from \"green island\" tissues using various molecular tools. Genes identified in tobacco plants can be readily used to identify orthologs in important crops including other members of the Solanaceae (tomato, pepper, eggplant, potato) and can be immediately used to manipulate senescence for agricultural improvement. Therefore, this research will have a profound impact on food production and safety.  Most importantly, this research is an important educational platform for training young plant biologists. It will be integrated into a graduate-level course called \"Plant Senescence\" at Cornell, and one graduate student and one postdoctoral associate will be directly involved in the research."

It can open the door to a new technology that is free from conventional microelectronics limitations with low power, high bandwidth, high speed and a high level of integration.     Recent results in Si Nanophotonics have shown the ability to guide, filter, bend and split light on Silicon chips using nano-size structures. Here it is proposed to address two of the major issues in Si-based Nanophotonics that remain the bottleneck of this field: 1. Coupling on-chip nano-size structures to off-chip micron size structures necessitated by the current absence of an all-Silicon optical source, and 2. Controlling externally the photonic structures for modulation and switching. The solution to these two key technical challenges will enable the design of all-optical and electro-optical systems with unprecedented performance.     In order to achieve coupling, switching and modulation on Silicon highly confining structures will be used. The high degree of optical confinement at a specific location of the structure increases the sensitivity of the device to external control. It also enables modification of the waveguiding modes in very short lengths, for increased coupling efficiency between different structures. The preliminary results show the feasibility of switching and coupling light using sub-micron size high confinement structures in Si and create the groundwork for this proposed research.     In addition to the research plan, it is proposed to develop: 1. An outreach program with the goal of addressing the retention problem of female students in engineering and in particular in the emerging field of nanotechnology by addressing career-family life issues, and 2. An educational program for exposing students to photonics as an interdisciplinary area and enhancing the undergraduate and graduate ECE curriculum in the area of photonics."

Identifying and understanding the factors that allow for the coexistence of species is central to ecological theory. This research will focus on insect species that rely on milkweeds, a diverse and charismatic group of plants.  The investigator will test the long-standing hypothesis that each insect species thrives under different (but not all) conditions and that such \"trade-offs\" prevent any one species from excluding all others.  This hypothesis will be experimentally tested in natural populations in New York State.  Milkweed plants exhibit high levels of genetic variation for six defensive and nutritional traits (chemical toxins, latex, nitrogen levels, etc).  These traits can negatively affect herbivore species and are often strongly modified (or \"induced\") following initial attack by insects.  Thus, the resource base for insect communities is highly dynamic.  The investigators will test whether trade-offs in the performance of insects on different plant phenotypes (generated by genetic variation or induced defenses) allow variation in plant populations to maintain insect diversity.  This research will also test the prediction that insect species that are less vulnerable to plant defenses will have a high susceptibility to predation or have a low ability to colonize new plant patches.  Using novel field manipulations, these factors will also be tested as mechanisms promoting diversity.      The insect-milkweed system is highly suitable for the development of laboratory and teaching tools for K-12 education, and the investigator will be involved in a variety of activities designed to bring science to K-12 classrooms and to develop teacher training tools."

In addition, by using this microbial community as a model, this research will reveal basic principles pertaining to the functional significance of microbial diversity and the mechanisms that regulate microbial process in soils. Thus, this project will have both specific and far reaching effects that will improve understanding of microbial processes in the soil, and the ability to effectively manage terrestrial ecosystems.

But while virtually all major enzyme functions have been successfully targeted, there is almost a complete lack of studies that target multi-protein cellular machinery.  In this proposal, techniques for analyzing and engineering a model complex protein machine, namely the bacterial twin-arginine translocation (Tat) machinery, will be developed.  The proposed studies will utilize a strategy termed directed co-evolution to:  (i) elucidate how the Tat machinery first recognizes it substrates and how it is able to discriminate between folded and misfolded proteins; and (ii) \"reprogram\" the Tat machinery towards new functions.  This research will shed light on a poorly understood biological mechanism and will lead to the harnessing of this machinery for both the expression of commercially important proteins and the identification of correctly folded protein sequences.

CROSSTEX  consists  of  three  sub-group  projects  that  address different coastal sediment transport processes, including sheet flow transport in the swash zone, suspended transport in the inner and outer surf zone and short-term morphological changes. These projects are interconnected by the nature of the problems to be studied and by the conducting of an  integrated  and  shared  experiment  in  the  large  wave  flume  at  the  Oregon  State  University (OSU).       This project   specifically  seeks  a  better  understanding  of  small-scale  sediment transport  processes  in  the  swash  zone.  The  instantaneous  fields  of concentration and fluid and sediment particle velocity will be measured in the sheet flow layer and these measurements and the directly calculated turbulent statistics, including the particle stress, will be used to test existing two-phase sediment transport models and to guide their further development.  To achieve the objectives, an integrated experimental, theoretical and computational research program is proposed.

In collaboration with other research  groups  in  the  CROSSTEX,  a  series  of  near  prototype  scale  experiments  will  be conducted in the large wave flume at the OSU. A new Fiberscope Measurement System (FMS) will be designed with a remotely controlled positioning device. By adopting quantitative imaging techniques, such as particle imaging velocimetry (PIV), simultaneous  high-resolution measurements of both fluid and sediment particle velocities can be obtained. Dr. Edwin Cowen will be responsible for the design and performance of the FMS.      Broader Impacts:   The research is at the interface between several fields of science and engineering- fluid dynamics, oceanography, geology, soil mechanics, and applied mathematics- and will serve as a bridge among them. All graduate students involved in the project will receive cutting-edge training in mathematical modeling, numerical methods, and experimental techniques.  The  numerical  models  to  be  developed  will  be  useful  as  research  tools  for  many  related engineering  science  fields  and  can  be  employed  to  investigate  wave-induced  soil  failures, scouring  around  coastal  structures,  debris  flows,  and  sand  dune migration.  The  laboratory  data will  be  used  to  benchmark  other  numerical  models  under  current  or  future  development.  A project web site will be developed to disseminate the results broadly in addition to publishing manuscripts in the peer-reviewed literature. The  research  program  will  have  significant  impacts  on  our  academic  programs.  Several upper-level undergraduate and graduate student courses at Cornell will benefit significantly from the research program, as the instruments developed in this project will be used in these courses and the experimental and numerical results will be included in the course material. We will also make  every  effort  to  directly  expose  undergraduate  students  to  the  research.  Oregon  State University is currently an REU site. At Cornell, the PIs and REU participants will work with staff members of the Sciencenter on exhibits on both the mechanics of sediment deposition and scour in rivers and along coasts. At Oregon State University, the PIs also have good working relationships with the local aquarium and science museum and will distribute distilled versions of CROSSTEX to them.

These processes define the distinct phases of a cell division cycle.  Defects in, or mis-coordination of these processes can have dire consequences to a proliferating cell resulting in chromosome damage, genome instability and chromosome mis-segregation.  The possible roles of the Drosophila MCM10 protein in DNA replication and heterochromatin formation and its effects on variegated gene expression, maintenance of genome integrity and chromosome segregation will be explored in this project.  MCM10 was initially characterized in the budding and fission yeast as an abundant nuclear protein that plays an important role in the initiation of DNA replication.  MCM10 is localized to replication origins, interacts physically and functionally with subunits of the presumptive replicative MCM helicase and facilitates the phosphorylation of the MCM helicase by the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase, a step believed to activate the MCM helicase.  Studies in Xenopus laevis confirmed the role of MCM10 in the initiation step and suggest that MCM10 plays a critical role in bridging the activation of the MCM helicase with the recruitment of factors required for DNA synthesis.  Recent Drosophila studies by the Tye laboratory showed that MCM10 interacts not only with components of the pre-replication complex that is assembled at replication origins during G1 phase, it also interacts with components of the elongation machinery.  Furthermore, it interacts with components of the heterochromatin complex including ORC and HP1.  RNA interference studies in tissue culture cells indicate that depletion of MCM10 leads to abnormal chromosome morphology such as aberrant chromosome condensation, precocious sister chromatid disjunction and possibly chromosome fragmentation.  These chromosomal abnormalities may be the indirect result of defects in DNA replication that affect chromatin condensation.  Alternatively, MCM10 may play a direct role in both DNA replication and chromatin condensation.    MCM10's role in DNA replication and the maintenance of chromosome integrity in Drosophila will be explored at the cellular level by addressing whether MCM10 depletion affects DNA replication and whether MCM10 depletion affects heterochromatin formation.  The developmental abnormalities that result from depletion of MCM10 will also be investigated at the organismal level.  The approaches taken will include construction of genetic null mutants, hypomorphic mutants and conditional transgenic RNAi mutants, mosaic analysis, PEV analysis, chromosome cytology, CFP and YFP colocalization as well as FRET analysis, and two-hybrid analysis.  Understanding biology requires understanding chromosomal biology- how the integrity of genetic information is preserved through the precise replication and segregation of chromosomes and how that information is selectively disseminated throughout development.  This project should increase the depth and breadth of our understanding of the mechanisms through which chromosomes carry out their many functions.  In addition, this research will help  train undergraduates and a graduate student and help a new investigator develop his teaching skills."

The project will examine the phase diagram of superfluid 3He for hysteresis in the occurrence of the \"A\" and \"B\" phases, for pinning, and for anisotropy in a variety of magnetic fields using ultrasensitive torsion pendulum devices. 4He will also be used to further reduce the volume accessible to the 3He (eventually into isolated \"bubble-like\" regions, while preserving superfluidity. The experiments on silica glass will use high Q resonators to focus on the very low temperature behavior (below 5mK) where there may be evidence of interactions between tunneling sites, as well as probe the non-linear behavior of these systems. These demanding experiments, which involve cutting edge instrumentation and development of new techniques, provide a challenging environment where graduate and undergraduate students acquire skills (the ability to innovate, initiate, design and carry out) as well as become familiar with analytic and display tools to prepare them for careers in the nation's scientific and technological infrastructure. The research program will also incorporate an undergraduate (year-round) as well as involve a high-school teacher in the research program during the summer.   %%%%%    3He (unlike all other elements) is in an inherently quantum-mechanical system that does not solidify (unless it is highly compressed) even down to absolute zero. It is one of the purest materials that can be prepared by any means, since at these temperatures, impurities simply freeze out during the procedures required to obtain the liquid state. Eventually 3He attains a highly ordered state - superfluidity, which is different from that attained in most superconductors and its sister isotope 4He. The magnetism of the superfluid atoms means that the atoms pair up together and undergo orbital motion exhibiting different phases or \"flavors\". All of this behavior is affected by introducing aerogel, a highly dilute glass (also termed solidified smoke) whose structure is so small that it penetrates into the superfluid pairs, altering the occurrence (and perhaps even the character) of the \"flavors\" of superfluid that appear. The research will look for changes under a variety of conditions, including when the helium is confined to small \"bubbles\". A second area probes our understanding of the properties of a standard glass at low temperatures, where one imagines that order is imposed by the absence of thermal excitations. However, the glass exhibits quantum characteristics, where atoms tunnel from one configuration to another, affecting the sound propagation qualities. By carrying out precise measurements on these systems the research will add to our understanding of the role of disorder under less extreme conditions. Besides adding to the understanding of quantum systems, this research provides a demanding experimental environment that educates and trains graduate and undergraduate students (and will also create a positive impact by involving a science teacher into the summer research program) for successful careers in the nation's scientific and technological infrastructure."

Thomas Avedisian, Cornell University  Co-PI: Wing Tsang, National Institute of Standards and Technology    Abstract  The proposal was received as an unsolicited submission to the Chemical and Transport Systems Division and was subsequently transferred to the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program. This research concerns developing a new type of chemical reactor for studying catalytic decomposition of organic liquids. The reactor concept is based on high temperature catalytic reaction in a subcooled liquid in which film boiling is established on a heated, catalyst-coated, surface such as a horizontal tube that is our baseline configuration.  The reactor volume is the vapor film surrounding the tube surface, and it is self-assembled in the sense of forming naturally as a consequence of establishing the film-boiling regime by heat transfer from the tube to the surrounding liquid.  Control variables for creating the reactor are the tube wall temperature and tube diameter, both of which also effect product yields.  The research will demonstrate operation of the reactor with conversion of methanol to hydrogen and carbon monoxide on a catalyst-coated tube immersed in a pool of sub-cooled methanol. A catalyst is required to drive the reaction at operational temperatures.   The reactor will operate as follows.   In film boiling, liquid will evaporate and diffuse across the film to the tube surface where reactant molecules are adsorbed and react, and vapor is simultaneously transported around the tube and combines with products that diffuse from the tube surface into the vapor film.  The gas mixture containing product and reactant vapors will be expelled from the system in the form of bubbles that percolate from the top of the tube.   The intellectual merit of the study is found in the development of the enabling technology for film boiling with chemical reaction.  Film boiling has not previously been used in a process to deliberately promote chemical reaction for a useful purpose, as a means to produce hydrogen, as a process to evaluate catalyst performance, or to measure rate constants associated with performance. The research of this project will examine this potential.  A test cell will be fabricated to contain a submerged tube coated with a catalyst (e.g., platinum black for methanol conversion) and be designed to measure product yields.  The data will be used in an analysis of film boiling with chemical reaction to extract kinetic rate data from product yield measurements.  The research team consists of two PIs with experience in phase change processes and chemical kinetics.   The broader impacts of the project relate to the variations and multiple functions envisioned for the film boiling reactor concept.  These include as a tool to study reaction engineering and as a portable means to produce hydrogen from organic liquids including biomass-derived fuels. The geometry selected for study is a horizontal tube coated with a catalyst because it is amenable to modeling and extending film boiling theory to chemical reaction; other physical configurations for a film boiling reactor are envisioned, including flat plates, tube arrays and scale-down to include a lab-on-a-chip concept.  With film boiling on the outside of a tube, the catalyst can be visually observed throughout reaction which contrasts with other reactor designs where the high temperature reaction zone is visually inaccessible and performance is measured by knowing only what went in and what came out.  As a means to produce hydrogen, the intent will be to show that hydrogen can be produced from the comparatively small physical volume of the vapor film surrounding the tube in the  film boiling regime.  With the tube surface being hot to drive surface reactions and the liquid/vapor interface cold, the problem of high temperature containment of reactant usually associated with other reactor concepts (e.g., packed bed reactor) is eliminated."

Tunable, millimeter-sized capillary lenses have recently been demonstrated by this group, with resolution approaching the maximum theoretical limit. The unique feature of these capillary lenses is that their tuning does not involve the movement of the contact line, where the fluids (the liquid that constitutes the lens and the gas surrounding it) meet the solid; contact line movement is avoided since it is a source of friction. The project will address two key issues: i) fast-response time and ii) small-scale packaging. The approach to meet the first challenge is to analyze shape changes in capillary lenses triggered via mechanical (pressure obtained by piezoelectric actuator) and electrical (electrokinetic) means. To address the second challenge, existing microfabrication techniques will be adapted and new ones developed for manufacturing capillary micro-lens arrays. For example, a novel technique may have to be developed to embed a porous medium in the middle of a glass chip for electrokinetic actuation. Micro-lens arrays will be studied at scales ranging from tens to hundreds of microns. The proposed research will ultimately make possible a technology to accurately control the minimum feature size by continuously adjusting the focal length of each micro-lens while the substrate is scanned underneath the array.    This project is expected to impact technological development, since capillary micro-lenses can be used to manipulate light, enabling high volume production (manufacturing) of small scale devices. Specifically, realization of an individually tunable micro-lens array can lead to dynamic photolithography, which can be used for example on curved surfaces. This is a gateway to 3-dimensional patterning capability with sub-micrometer features. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary senior team is expected to provide a unique research opportunity for educating graduate and undergraduate students."

This structure has a very significant lattice anisotropy, which causes a large orientation-dependence of the transport of matter and charge. Details on this subject are known so far only for the iron silicate fayalite. The observed orientation dependences for fayalite are among the largest so far known for non-layered crystal structures. A completely open question is how the replacement of Fe by Co, Mn and Ni will influence the orientation dependence of the transport of matter and charge. This question will be systematically investigated for the transport of matter and charge in orthosilicates of the type Me2SiO4+d with Me = Co, Mn and Ni. The research will be performed in an international collaboration with the group of Klaus-Dieter Becker at the Technical University of Braunschweig (Germany). The emphasis at Cornell will be to establish the crystal orientation and oxygen activity dependence of tracer diffusion coefficients of the cations.  Complementary studies of the electrical conductivity and on the kinetics of the reequilibration after oxygen activity jumps will be performed in Germany. In addition, to allow modeling of the observed oxygen activity dependences, thermogravimetric studies will be performed at Cornell University whenever necessary. To enable the proposed studies of the orientation dependence, single crystal growth will be performed at Cornell by using the floating zone method. The program will provide training at the graduate and undergraduate level and will also provide experiences in international collaboration.  The results of this fundamental research will very significantly improve the basic understanding of transport of matter and charge in an important class of materials, which crystallize in the olivine structure. For example, in the applied geosciences, olivine structure minerals are common materials in the upper mantle of the Earth. An improved knowledge of this type of materials will aid to better understand the history of the Earth. On the other hand, lithium iron phosphate is an olivine structure material with a very high electrical conduction, making it a promising candidate for being used as the cathode in lithium batteries. Therefore, the field of solid-state electrochemistry and others will also benefit from this research program. This broad relevance clearly justifies public support of the proposed research. The research will focus on the transport of matter and charge in orthosilicates with the olivine structure and will include the growth of single crystals and measurements related to the transport of cations and of electrical charge. Due to its collaborative nature, the program involves an exchange of graduate students between the Technical University of Braunschweig (Germany) and Cornell University.

This porous substance is known as an impurity-helium solid.  The clusters contain large concentrations of these atoms (free radicals), which are stabilized against recombination into molecules by the surrounding molecules contained in the clusters as well as the layers of solid helium.  Studies will be made of the chemical energy stored in the trapped free radicals, which can be released when they recombine into molecules.  Investigations will primarily employ magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy. Quantum mechanically driven chemical reactions, which can occur even at absolute zero and can lead to exchange between free hydrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms bound in molecules, will be studied.  At the very lowest temperatures, the atomic hydrogen free radicals may even undergo Bose-Einstein condensation, an extreme form of quantum behavior that can give rise to superfluidity.  Postdocs and students trained in this program will acquire research skills in cryogenics and magnetic resonance, techniques that have wide utility in many areas of science and technology.        ******TECHNICAL ABSTRACT******  This research program will involve studies of hydrogen or nitrogen atoms embedded in molecular matrices consisting of hydrogen or nitrogen molecules, respectively.  The matrices can be either bulk molecular solids or porous gels (impurity-helium solids) composed of nanoclusters of the molecular solids, each of which is surrounded by a monolayer or two of solid helium.  The resulting matrix isolation of the atomic free radicals stabilizes them against recombination into molecules, allowing them to be studied for many days.  Properties of these systems will be investigated at temperatures ranging from 4 K down to 100 mK or less.  Magnetic resonance, low frequency magnetic susceptibility and optical spectroscopy will be employed.  Studies of magnetic ordering, tunneling exchange chemical reactions, and magnetic relaxation will be performed.  A search will be made for possible Bose-Einstein condensation in the embedded hydrogen atoms.

All these systems lay near the metal-insulator boundary, some on one side, some on the other, have complex scaling properties, and potentially contain interfaces between their more metallic (covalent) and more ionic components. They test the boundaries of current paradigms useful for pure metals, insulators or semiconductors. Students working on this project will learn how to apply modern electronic structure calculations to understand the complex crystal structures that can now be obtained through modern synchrotron radiation diffraction experiments.    NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION  The classic alloys of civilization, brass and bronze, the elements, copper silver and gold lie at the heart of the proposed project.  Our understanding today of their structures is remarkably still often imbedded in classical notions: the Platonic polyhedra for example. This project aims at a coherent structural reworking of these structures and the other structures derived from them.  It will be a reworking from a classical geometrical picture (still used in understanding structures of gamma-brass for example), to paradigms based on simple quantum mechanical calculations. It is anticipated that the understanding will evolve into models based on minimal surfaces and interlocking intermeshed substructures. The materials being studied are chosen not just because they have hitherto proven difficult to understand but also because we think that such materials possess an unusual balance of bonding trends that could very well lead to materials with novel properties such as segregation between ionic and metallic components , and sub-lattice shear patterns, properties which affect the electrical and magnetic and cohesion properties of these essential alloys."

When observational resources are scarce and expensive, an adaptive approach to selecting which observations to make, based on the data assembled thus far, should be able to improve the accuracy, precision and efficiency of the work.    This research will develop a general framework for flexible, adaptive scientific exploration based on iterating an Observation-Inference-Design cycle, relying on Bayesian methods and called Bayesian Adaptive Exploration (BAE).  Developing BAE through a broad range of methodological research, and then applying BAE to several time-variable phenomena, will lead to numerous theoretical and algorithmic innovations in statistics, and to significantly improved answers in the study of extra-solar planets, binary star systems, minor planets in our solar system, and variable stars in nearby galaxies.  Since the required calculations are extremely demanding, several approaches will be explored, including extending existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo inference algorithms, developing bridge/path importance sampling algorithms and Gaussian process meta-models, and the use of sub-region-adaptive quadrature.    BAE is an adaptive generalization of the scientific method and will therefore be broadly applicable in many disciplines.

Current estimates suggest human activities have doubled the amount of biologically active nitrogen on a global basis, with agriculture accounting for 75 percent of the human-derived nitrogen.  A complex set of environmental and socio-economic factors influence agricultural fertilizer management practices.  Linkages among socioeconomic and ecological subsystems are recognized as crucial in efforts to pursue sustainable ecosystem management and improve nitrogen-use efficiency.  Disconnections between human and natural subsystems must be addressed as well as disconnections within the component subsystems.  Within the human realm, those who pollute do not pay the costs associated with resource degradation.  Likewise, the biophysical system that has evolved as a result of high, input industrial agriculture is fraught with ecological disconnections.  For example, uncoupling of carbon and nitrogen cycles is a defining trait of agricultural systems and is the root cause of the leakiness of these systems.  On average, 45 percent to 55 percent of fertilizer nitrogen applied is lost to the environment.  The goal of this research project is to understand how interactions among social and biophysical subsystems impact on carbon and nitrogen cycles in intensively managed agricultural landscapes at multiple scales.  Specific objectives of the project are (1) to investigate how the human subsystem responds to the environmental consequences of carbon nitrogen uncoupling, (2) to evaluate the relationships between nitrogen leakiness, institutional capacity, and proximity to degraded aquatic resources, (3) to determine which policy changes are likely to be most effective in promoting more efficient nitrogen fertilizer-management practices, and (4) to model and simulate multi-scale interactions among policies, farm managers, and institutions as well as nitrogen losses across space and time.  To understand how institutions respond to degradation of aquatic ecosystems, the investigators will compare the institutions and management approaches used in the Chesapeake Bay, where the negative impacts of excess nitrogen inputs are experienced more locally and by the farmers themselves, to those in the Midwest, where the negative impacts are much more remote.  Research methods include field research, isotopic tracer studies, construction of mass balances at multiple scales, face-to-face interviews and surveys with stakeholders, geographical information systems, remote sensing, global positioning systems, statistical tools, systems modeling, and simulation.    This project has implications for coupled human-natural systems theory and methodology, social systems theory, and environmental policy.  The theory of how the human and biophysical subsystems of managed landscapes is not well developed, particularly in the case of intensively managed, high-input agricultural systems.  This research will enhance fundamental understanding of how social and ecosystem emergent properties mediate interactions among human and natural systems.  In addition to using a synthetic interdisciplinary approach, the investigators will depart from a microeconomic model of social dynamics in which the aggregated behavior of individual actors is taken to represent social processes.  They will focus primarily at the institutional level, where the social emergent properties govern the interactions between and social and natural subsystems.  The project also will have practical outcomes of relevance to the development of agricultural and resource-management policy.  This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

These two themes can be studied in a  unified way by considering a general conic problem   and a related problem associated with unboundedness.   Several topics will be investigated from this viewpoint:  the relationship between optimal solutions, central paths,  and Newton steps for the two formulations,  and the development of so-called self-concordant barrier  functions for faces and recession cones of convex sets for  which such barriers are known.

The project will extend the capabilities of these methods to  detect when such problems have been poorly formulated  so that optimal solutions do not exist.

The ideas we propose are distributed, cooperative and data driven and challenge some of the conventional wisdom used in building communication networks today which neglect fundamental aspects of the problem, such as: 1) the sensors are not end users; 2) the sensors can cooperate rather than contend for the medium to deliver critical information; 3) the aggregate entropy/complexity of the data in space and time is low. In fact, sensor networks are deployed to record unexpected dispersed events, sudden but localized changes, inconsistencies or discontinuities that occur rarely. Current network technology applied to this problem fails in one fundamental aspect: the scalability. The interactions among nodes are heavily structured in a number of layered functionalities.    Scalability will result from un-complicating the interactions between the  large population of devices and constraining their operations and message exchange to be through a broadcast, noisy, limited range interface. The most original contribution of this research is in finding a class of scheduling strategies that operate within these restrictions and is driven by the sensors' data, achieving efficient transmission from the distributed sources without requiring any prior exchange of data among them."

This research involves the design, implementation, and evaluation of new standards-compliant data compression methods that will allow ASL video, and other structured video, to be transmitted over low bandwidth cell phone channels.  To be more specific, the goal of this research is to develop a framework in which to implement low-complexity H.264 encoding to provide maximum quality compressed structured video.  Because the developed algorithms will be H.264 standard-compliant, an off-the-shelf H.264 decoder can be used.    The research applies to any class of videos where there is some inherent structure that can be exploited.  The five areas of research are: (1) Design of an appropriate objective distortion metric for ASL; (2) Design of algorithms to preprocess video for display on small devices; (3) Development of methods to exploit structure in video for efficient coding; (4) Implementation of a rate-distortion-complexity optimization of H.264 using the new metric; and (5) Applications of the framework to other structured video such as surveillance video.

The approach is based on spectral analysis techniques that were previously developed for sparse graphs, and are extended to work on complex networks in order to defuse the \"majority rule\" where the stronger areas of the network structure dominate the overall structure. The outcome is that the network analysis will not be dominated by the stronger nodes obscuring weaker nodes that are structurally significant in the network. The project also develops methods for tracking changes in such graphs in order to discover new clusters, e.g., novel research communities. Clusters that occur in most of these networks are the natural communities, and provide a basic unit of analysis for tracking over time. Finally, the network analysis and modeling methods are extended to heterogeneous graphs that include multiple link types. The work combines the development of formal models with the analysis of empirical data.

Numerical schemes are commonly   used to approximate the solution satisfying particular boundary   conditions. Such schemes usually require solving a large system of coupled   non-linear discretized equations. Iterative methods for such systems can   be very expensive computationally, often leading practitioners to use   alternative problem descriptions to avoid solving the full boundary value   problem. The investigator proposes a family of fast (non-iterative)   methods for a wide class of static PDEs, for which the direction of   \"information flow\" defines a natural ordering on the discretized   equations. In a joint work with J.A. Sethian, non-iterative Ordered Upwind   Methods (OUMs) were introduced for Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs arising in   anisotropic (& hybrid) control and in front propagation. The investigator   proposes to extend OUMs to boundary value problems describing differential   games and non-autonomous optimal control problems.    In a joint work with J. Guckenheimer, the OUMs were   previously applied to a special system of quasilinear PDEs to approximate   invariant manifolds of vector fields. The investigator proposes to extend   the invariant manifold approach to compute multi-valued solutions of   boundary value problems.    The efficiency of the proposed methods stems from the notion of   \"causality\" -- unobvious yet natural ordering of the elements of   computation.  This approach is relevant for the applications as diverse as   robotic navigation and photolithography, seismic imaging and computational   geometry, optics and transient elastography, differential games and   segmentation of images.  Which trajectory is optimal for a rover traveling   on the surface of Mars?  With what delay and how strongly will an   underground explosion be felt by a sensor at a given point on the surface?    What are the optimal parameter values for etching and deposition in the   integrated circuit manufacturing?  What is the minimum safe distance for   the aircraft collision avoidance?  Will the electrical power system   automatically recover after a \"fault\"? Answering these important practical   questions in real time requires efficient and robust numerical methods for   solving the corresponding partial differential equations."

For example, of all the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees a few are biologically important and confer our ability to speak and walk upright while others have no discernable effect and are due to the random fixation of chance mutations since the divergence from a common ancestor.  Likewise, there is tremendous interest in identifying mutations segregating in natural populations that are deleterious / disruptive of biological function. Since even for closely related species there are likely to be millions of genetic differences (most of which are likely non-significant), computational tools are needed for identifying those that are most important or interesting. The goal of this project is to develop statistical models for comparing patterns of genetic variation within and between species in order to identify which changes fall into adaptive (beneficial), neutral, or deleterious categories.  The scope of the project is focused on development of mathematical models and statistical methods for fitting the models to the growing amount of genetic data. This project will focus on analyzing variation within populations of humans, Drosophila (fruit fly), and other ``model'' organisms where large data sets are being collected by other groups.

These include the origin of the entire genus associated with an ancient genome duplication event, relationships among the reproductively isolated \"genome groups\" to which the approximately 25 diploid perennial species of the genus belong, and the complex history of genetic differentiation among closely related species within these genome groups.  All of these issues have in common the possibility that hybridization has played a role in producing the patterns observed in DNA variation from nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes.  Polyploidy (multiple sets of chromosomes) and hybridization separately, or together in allopolyploidy, are two of the most important processes that shape the genomes of plants, including cultivated plants such as wheat, maize, cotton, and soybean.  In the case of Glycine it is unknown whether hybridization was involved in polyploid formation, as hypothesized to have occurred 15 million years ago, and if so, what species were the donors of the two genomes.  This and other questions at progressively more recent stages in the history of Glycine that involve the role of polyploidy and hybridization can be addressed by studying a large number of genes on the different chromosomes or in different genomic compartments (mitochondrion, chloroplast).  The largest source of such genes is the nuclear genome, and this project taps genomic projects in soybean and other legumes (e.g., Medicago truncatula) to provide many candidate genes for study.  Around 100 nuclear genes will be assessed for their utility in addressing phylogenetic questions, taking into account such additional criteria as position on the soybean genetic map.  Analytical methods will include phylogeny reconstruction using various approaches, assessment of incongruence, testing for polytomies and hybridity, network construction, and admixture assessment. The work will address general issues of dealing with incongruence, identifying and using low copy nuclear genes, and studying polyploidy.   Achieving a better understanding of polyploidy and hybridization in general, and particularly in Glycine, is of broad relevance and significance for plant biology and genetics because of the prevalence of these phenomena.  The project will have an impact on the infrastructure of science by training undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, including minority undergraduate students who will participate in summer research internships.  Collaboration with the Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers will lead to the development of phylogeny laboratories for high school and middle school students.  The project is international in its scope, with researchers from the United States and Australia, and involves the use and enhancement of germplasm resources in the form of Glycine seed collections in both countries."

The new studies proposed here will identify the cellular and molecular events that mediate rapid steroid actions on nerve cells (neurons) that directly generate behavior, in this case vocalizations that are essential for social communication.  Long-term influences of steroids on the development and maintenance of vocal behaviors and neurons is well known, but their short-term actions is both unexpected and essentially unexplored. The vocal control system of teleost fish presents the most basic example of how the central nervous system of vertebrates produces social, context-dependent vocalizations. The PI has discovered that androgens, estrogen and cortisol (the major \"stress\" steroid in teleost fish) induce rapid changes in the output of vocal neurons that parallel the time course of steroid effects on natural calling behaviors. This now provides a model to study the physiological basis for rapid steroid effects on neurons that directly lead to changes in a social behavior. Neurophysiological, molecular and behavioral methods will be used to show how steroids shape neuronal function, where the receptors that mediate these effects are located, and how vocal behaviors are influenced by one or more steroids. The principles identified apply to other vertebrates because vocal, neural and endocrine mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved between teleosts and other groups, including birds and mammals.

All multi-celled organisms begin as an undifferentiated single celled egg and use the instructions written in the genome to create the specialized cells and organs of the adult. Recent genome sequencing projects reinforce earlier ideas that form is derived from how genes are regulated and coordinated; and by implication evolution, proceeds more by tinkering with the regulation of genes than creating new genes.  The inference of gene regulation from the genome is still in its infancy, and many of the current genome sequencing projects are focused on clusters of related organisms with the intent of using interspecies comparisons as a filter for what is conserved and by implication most important for function. However, we are still largely ignorant of how regulatory information is encoded in the genome and simply comparing sequence may be like comparing the same sentence in two languages.      Statistical mechanics is fundamentally concerned with computing the probabilities of patterns and assessing whether a sample is consistent with a model (more technically, the probability of the data given  the model). The fruit fly has been a model for genetics and development for 100 years, and the genomes of 10 related species will be available in early 2005. Together with a developmental biology lab at Rockefeller University, we will ask whether our earlier successes in computing which regions of the genome control early embryonic patterning, can be made more quantitative by computing the partition function for binding the regulatory proteins to the DNA. The regulation we understand in fly will be mapped onto the other sequenced species, as well as the mosquito, as a test of our understanding and to see how regulation evolves.    In a previous project we classified the basic molecular events through which regulatory sequence changes by studying recently diverged fly species. Since regulatory DNA directs gene expression by binding proteins, simulating how this property is preserved under mutation and selection should provide clues about how to decode natural sequence. The goal is to cast evolution as an optimization process and thus make it more a predictive theory, rather than a historical one.    Cells have to coordinate many processes to divide and cells must cooperate to form an organism.  The networks that accomplish this coordination are an important focus of current biology. The cell division cycle is arguable the basis of life itself, and many of the key genes are preserved between single celled yeast and mammals. Aberrations in the control of cell division and growth lead to cancer.  The PI plans to process movies of single yeast cells growing into clusters with custom image processing software to investigate how cell to cell variability is indicative of the control network. Do larger cells divide more rapidly, and does the duration of the various phases of the cell cycle correlate?  The cell cycle has to strictly order certain processes, e.g. DNA replication must precede the segregation of chromosomes, we will ask whether the fluctuations provide evidence for sub modules within the cell cycle (e.g. is DNA replication tied to bud emergence, and the expression of certain cyclin genes). A large collection of cell cycle mutants has been derived from screens on populations of cells and one should reexamine their properties at the single cell level. Specifically are certain genes responsible for maintaining the temporal coherence of submodules? As a representative cellular network, are there some aspects of the cell cycle that are better modeled as discrete, binary, systems rather than sets of differential equations?

The investigators will continue their agenda of integrating psychologically more realistic assumptions about human behavior into formal economic models, to modify and improve economic theory in those areas where it is most importantly inaccurate.    This award funds research exploring the implications of self-control problems for the interplay between what consumers buy and when they buy it. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that it helps to further delineate the implications of basic lessons from psychology for basic economics. Indeed, the investigators revisit a core domain of economic behavior - consumer choice under budget constraints - with one of the  simplest and most successful models from the emerging behavioral-economics literature - selfcontrol problems modeled as a time-inconsistent taste for immediate gratification. The analysis of consumer choice is both a good place to empirically identify the nature of people's self-control problems, and a realm where self-control problems might have some of their most profound effects.    The research has two main thrusts. The first studies the relationship between prices, quantity purchased, and timing of purchases for unhealthy goods. In particular, self-control problems can lead to responses to non-linear prices or price variation that would not arise for those without self-control problems. For instance, consumers who don't fully anticipate their future selfcontrol problems may take insufficient advantage of low prices or bulk purchasing, and hence end up spending more than necessary for their purchases.    The second thrust concerns the relationship between the timing of total consumptions expenditures and the composition of that spending. Goods differ in terms of when they deliver utility. Some goods, such as restaurant meals and entertainment, deliver mostly short-term pleasure. Other goods, such as TVs, bicycles, and other durables, deliver both short-term and long-term pleasure.  And many goods have consequences beyond the direct pleasure from consumption. For instance, potato chips, soda, or other unhealthy goods can create negative future consequences, while exercise, investment in cultural skills, and social networking can create positive future consequences.     The investigators show how the exact timing of when goods deliver pleasure and pain is far more important for people with self-control problems than those without, and how the availability and preferences regarding these different types of goods can dramatically change both the behavioral and welfare implications of self-control problems for the timing of consumption. The investigators intend to study how the common worry by economists about distortions in a person's overall spending and savings ought be supplemented or modified in light of concerns about what bundles of goods are being purchased.    In fact, among the broader impacts of this research is that it can help move economics to more realistic analysis of policies designed to address savings behavior, credit-card borrowing, overconsumption of unhealthy goods, obesity, and similar phenomena. While the research itself is preliminary and theoretical, the investigators hope that by combining the many insights of rational choice economics with the acknowledgment that people might have limits to their self-control, this research will improve the contribution economics can make to policy analysis in these areas.  1"

A  patterned polymer brush in comparison is one that is attached to a surface in a spatially  defined micron or nanometer-sized region. A focus of the proposed research will be to  examine the synthesis of di- and triblock copolymer brushes and to evaluate in detail  their polymerization and microstructure. A second focus of this proposal will be to  pattern polymer brushes at length scales comparable to brush length and to investigate  their behavior and microstructure in these confined regions. Patterning methods will  include e-beam and EUV lithography as well as near-field scanning optical methods. If  successful, this study will provide an exciting opportunity to overcome many of the  barriers currently encountered in small scale (~10 nm) structure formation and at the same  time provide an excellent model system for exploring the converging length scales in  top-down (lithography) and bottom-up (self-assembly) processing. We expect that this  convergence will lead to interesting synergies and may enable directed assembly of the  block copolymer brushes. Such an approach could bridge the gap between the limits of  current lithographic methods (>50 nm) and the need to achieve nanostructures as small as  10 nm. The proposed research will require expertise in polymer synthesis, lithographic  patterning and analytical methods capable of characterizing the small-scale structures we  plan to produce. To aid us in the characterization of these new materials, we will make  use of our collaborations to investigate the patterned block copolymer brushes using a  range of synchrotron based analytical methods including X-ray reflectometry, grazing  incidence (GI) SAXS and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) studies.

The objective is to educate scientists and engineering students (largely PhD students) and postdoctoral researchers in the methods of research used to tackle cutting edge problems in materials research. At the same time CCMR manages and maintains a set of shared experimental facilities that enable this research to be carried out; these facilities are also actively used by a wide spectrum of researchers from across the campus, from other Universities, Government Laboratories and Industry. CCMR also has an expansive and effective educational outreach program that helps students and teachers from primary, secondary and local colleges to learn about materials sciences, recent advances and how to integrate this new knowledge into the classroom. Finally, CCMR's Industrial Partnerships program speeds the transition of new scientific discoveries into technologies that can promote economic growth and opportunities.    Our research is organized into teams focused on several specific topics, including: Controlling Electrons at Interfaces, \"Building Blocks\" for Photonic Systems, and the Study of the Dynamics of Growth of Complex Materials. CCMR also manages a \"Seed Program\" that supports smaller short term activities that explore high-risk/high-payoff areas and that integrates new faculty into our interdisciplinary culture. Our long term goal is to control materials systems at or near the level of atomistic precision (atom identity and geometric placement), as is possible in the synthesis of some organic molecules. Our vision is that such control will allow precision tuning of properties and is likely to uncover vast new areas of science, to facilitate the construction of a wide variety of novel devices, and to enable technologies not presently imagined. The proposed research capitalizes on unique science we recently developed, substantially extends the effort in new and ground breaking directions, and explores entirely new topics; all require new talents, new skills and new senior investigators."

At the start of the millenium, the world's particle physicists arrived at a consensus that an ILC should be the next major facility for high-energy physics. Since then, candidate technologies for the accelerator were developed, the global community has agreed on the technology to be used and a global center to coordinate the completion of the design is now forming.      Realizing the vision of the ILC will be a great challenge both technically and in timeliness. The technical challenges lie in both detector and accelerator areas and derive from the need for high luminosity and high precision of measurement. The timeliness challenge lies in the need to have significant overlap with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) if the full synergy of the two approaches to the energy frontier is to be achieved.  The physics goals of the ILC require a starting center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV, upgradeable to approximately 1 TeV or more, and a luminosity that is an ambitious four orders of magnitude larger than that achieved by the Stanford Linear Collider.  Achieving the high energy and ultra-low emittance of the ILC requires significant new advances in many areas of accelerator physics and technology, including beam simulation, beam diagnostics, radio-frequency structure development, and accelerator controls. This proposal addresses leading challenges in these areas, bringing to bear the talents of both experienced accelerator scientists and experimental physicists with expertise in instrumentation. In order to provide governments with a convincing design and cost estimate, in time for substantial overlap with the LHC, these accelerator challenges need to be addressed urgently. This proposal seeks to be a visible step towards that goal.  This program will have scientific impact beyond the ILC. The accelerator physics R&D will push the state of the art in many areas (such as diagnostics) that have applications across the whole spectrum of accelerators. Benefits will accrue to the many other fields such as materials science, condensed matter physics, biophysics, and medical science, which utilize accelerators as their front-line research tools.  The collaborating groups have a strong history of outreach to undergraduates and K-12 students and teachers. The work supported by this proposal will be integrated into these outreach efforts."

Stroock, James Engstrom and Kelvin Lee  Institution:  Cornell University  Proposal Number: 0529042  Title: SST: Optimized Microfluidic Mass Transfer and Magnetic Sensing for Detection of Pseudomonas syringae    Intellectual Merit. The overarching objective of this project is to develop technology for the detection of Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial plant pathogen. The technology that is to be developed will rely on the ability to detect an effector-helper protein expressed during pathogenesis of this organism. The detection of the effector-helper protein will rely on the use of giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors embedded in microfluidic devices. It is expected that the technical advances and sensors developed through this project will have broad applicability to the sensing of many biological systems. The project has the following specific aims:  1) Development of fundamental principles and microfluidic tools for the optimization of mass transfer to sensing elements on solid surfaces.  2) Development of protein and surface chemistry for a Magnetic Tag Protein Sensor that is compatible with giant magnetoresistant sensing.  3) Implementation of optimal microfluidic mass transfer strategies for protein detection with Magnetic Tag GMR sensors.  4) Construction of an interdisciplinary research community and curriculum at Cornell University based around the physical, chemical, and experimental principles of microchemical technology. Increased participation in research by members of underrepresented groups through REU activities.     The development of chemical and biochemical sensors is a vast technological challenge, as the sensing elements must inevitably reflect some of the endless diversity that exists in the molecular species that must be sensed. Nonetheless, there are generic physical and chemical aspects of the sensing process that must be optimized for all sensing strategies: 1) Mass transfer for the species of interest (analyte) to the point of detection, 2) sensitive detection of the presence of the analyte, and 3) chemically specific recognition of the analyte. The PIs propose to address fundamental challenges associated with the optimization of these three aspects of sensing in the important context of surface based bio-sensors. In particular, they plan to develop transport analysis and microfluidic tools to increase the rates of mass transfer to solid detector surface, to develop protein and surface chemistries that allow for attachment of magnetic bead-labeled proteins and antibodies that allow for detection with high sensitivity, and to develop new inert surfaces and shear-based mechanisms to limit non-specific signal and thus improve selectivity.    Broader Impact. ThePIs have been actively engaged in the incorporation of scale-down into the Chemical Engineering curriculum. These activities have included the development of several new core and elective courses in the chemical engineering curriculum to emphasize the important role of engineering analysis in small-scale design. Further, the team has been engaged in outreach activities that bring together the Cornell community to discuss issues and challenges related to microscale systems. Beyond this local impact, the team has participated in activities that include the \"It's a NanoWorld\" exhibit that has been seen by more than 700,000 nonscientists and they have been key players in an ethics workshop to consider the Societal Implications of Nanotechnology."

QMC is one among the most precise known techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provide a significant gain in precision compared traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches. This will bring electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methodology to a qualitatively higher level of applicability to complex materials and lead to increased accuracy. The new QMC techniques will be applied to forefront problems in the properties of Earth materials in order to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. One significant limitation of today's QMC methods is the high computational demand, which currently makes applications to larger systems including solid solutions prohibitively expensive. A substantial portion of the QMC computation is spent on forming and evaluating a Slater determinant, which is constructed from one-particle orbitals. The team plans to develop and apply different localization transformations in order to obtain a sparse determinant. Two linear algebra methods will be developed for their efficient evaluation. First, Krylov's method for the iterative evaluation of a determinant will be incorporated into QMC. Secondly, the trace of the determinant will be calculated with Monte Carlo methods. Both techniques will further the goal of obtaining an order-N QMC techniques that are more efficient and applicable to a wider range of materials, well beyond the current possibilities.    Computational mineral physics is part of the large effort to use computer simulations to predict and understand properties of the Earth. New mathematical techniques will be derived to make advance quantum Monte Carlo simulations more precise and significantly more efficient. The properties of important Earth materials at high pressure will be predicted with unprecedented accuracy. This work will also lead to a more precise description of a number of fundamental phase transitions in solid deep Earth. This project is a close collaboration between a mathematician, mathematical physicists, and geophysicists. It will bring new applied math methods into geoscience, with broad applicability to all Earth materials. The broader impact will include the development of new computational techniques applicable to many areas as well as the education of graduate students and post-docs in state-of-the-art materials simulations, teaching of new computational techniques in graduate level classes and during two workshops that will be organized."

The investigation also seeks to quantify space-time variability in the convection pattern during quite and disturbed periods. This variability contributes to Joule heating and is, along with wave heating, a significant but neglected aspect of magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling. The investigators will investigate the following questions: Does contemporary theory fully account for wave heating due to Farley Buneman instabilities? How does the Doppler shift of type 1 radar echoes depend on electron and ion temperature? How do the Doppler shifts of type 1 and 2 auroral echoes depend on the convection velocity? On what do the spectral widths of auroral echoes depend? What are the effects of neutral winds? How much can variability in the convection electric field contribute to the Joule heating rate? The study will make use of common volume observations from the AMISR incoherent scatter radar near Fairbanks and a coherent scatter radar imager in Anchorage. Together, they form a powerful diagnostic tool for studying auroral E region plasma waves and wave effects with minimal ambiguity. The broader impact the research will come in the form of the experimental tools and codes that will be developed for AMISR and made available to the aeronomy community, the development and validation of radar imaging techniques which are applicable outside the immediate field of interest, and the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in radio science and engineering. Furthermore, the work will expand the experimental site in Anchorage which is an ideal research and training venue, given its proximity to the AMISR and the Poker Flat Range."

To design interfaces that more adequately engage this full range of human experience, some researchers now advocate affective computing, in which computers automatically sense, process, and respond to human emotions, but having computers measure and report on intimate data without users' explicit awareness and consent raises substantial concerns around who is in control.  Furthermore, it is challenging to accurately sense complex and elusive emotions influenced by many physiological, individual, and cultural factors that are unavailable to computational sensors, and the need to simplify emotions in order to computationally model them may lead to interfaces that flatten our emotional experiences rather than engaging our emotions in their full everyday richness.  Such problems are based on a fundamental affective gap, a disjunction between the subjective, situated, cultural, and social ways in which people think about and experience emotions and the objective, formalized ways in which computers model them.  In this project the PIs will attempt to close the affective gap by sharing the burden of affective interpretation between people and machines.  In this model, people and machines collaborate to construct affective experiences; machines track user behavior and supply feedback, which users interpret to develop affective awareness.  Shifting the center of interpretation and reflection from the system towards the user keeps users in charge of emotional meaning-making, addresses emotions that computational systems alone cannot truly understand, and focuses our design efforts not on formalizations of affect but on rich, complex, idiosyncratic, and potentially enigmatic emotional experiences.  Systems requiring active user interpretation pose serious challenges for design and evaluation in HCI, since we no longer have direct control of system meaning but instead design and evaluate for unexpected appropriation.  Drawing from the arts, humanities, and critical design, the PIs' systems will encourage interpretation by reflecting the complex, ambiguous nature of affect, allowing people to actively make sense of the system's output in the context of their everyday lives and relationships.    Broader Impacts:  The PIs will develop systematic design and evaluation strategies, a theoretical foundation, and detailed case studies that make affective presence a sustainable, reproducible contribution to HCI.  The work will lead to new technology that leaves users in charge of the interpretation of their emotions yet allows construction of systems that touch on intimate issues without being intrusive, supports user reflection on the role of affect in technology, and enables designers to create a new, wide range of emotional experiences even though computers have difficulty modeling those experiences."

Although an agency may receive hundreds of thousands of comments for a proposed rule, its legal obligation is to review and respond to all significant comments. As requirements to consult, study, and/or certify have proliferated, rule writers have found it increasingly difficult to keep track of them and to recognize which, if any, are relevant in a particular rulemaking. Electronic rulemaking (eRulemaking) has the potential to radically transform the N&C process. It could make the process more transparent and accessible to the public, and more substantively reliable and cost-effective for the agency. So far, though, E-docket systems and eRulemaking workbenches make only rudimentary use of available technology.  This grant will use well-developed and emerging methods of natural language processing (NLP) to develop tools to aid agency rule writers in: (1) organizing, analyzing, and managing the comments, studies, and other supporting documents associated with a proposed rule; and (2) analyzing proposed rules to flag possibly relevant legal mandates from among the large number of statutes and Executive Orders that potentially require  analyses, consultations, or certifications during rulemaking. The research team will collaborate with the Federal Departments of Transportation and Commerce.  The team will focus, in particular, on the use of  information extraction, text categorization, and opinion-oriented text analysis techniques in both supervised and weakly supervised machine learning frameworks. Evaluation will involve: the use of accepted technical measures of NLP performance (e.g., recall and precision); a combination of qualitative and quantitative social science methods to assess integration of the tools into the rulewriting process as perceived by staff at various levels of the agency hierarchy; and observation by legally-trained researchers with expert understanding of the rulemaking process.    Intellectual Merit.   The research will help realize the positive potential of eRulemaking, advance the state-of-the-art in NLP, and improve our understanding of the effects of technology on rulemaking. Because of its interdisciplinary composition - combining expertise in NLP, expert knowledge about regulatory law and legal information systems, and social science experience in the effect of technology on organizations - the Cornell team is well situated to generate both qualitative and quantitative data about the crucial, but still  largely under-studied, rulemaking process.    Broader Impacts.  The project provides an important opportunity for interdisciplinary education and research for PhD, master's, and undergraduate students in Cornell's Information Science Program. All data sets and tools will be made available to other researchers. The NLP methods to be developed are general-purpose techniques, trainable for any domain or genre, and useful in any context that requires managing, organizing, and analyzing large volumes of text. Finally, many of the same techniques that help agency rule writers can be used to design  agency websites that help the public search, sort, and otherwise selectively access materials in the rulemaking process."

The observations will be coordinated with interferometric and imaging radar systems such as those at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, which provides crucial backscatter measurements of the dynamic properties of the irregularities. The incoherent scatter radar at Jicamarca will measure ionospheric parameters crucial for understanding the preconditioning of the plasma for instability. The ground-based observations will enhance the scientific and operation mission of C/NOFS, which is to understand and predict ionosphere irregularities and scintillations.

The southern Puna (25 degrees S to 28 degrees S) is not only key to understanding Andean evolution, it is also the type locale for testing the delamination hypothesis for removal of thickened eclogitic continental crust along with continental mantle lithosphere. Such crustal removal provides an explanation for the near absence of a dense mafic root in many orogenic regions (including the central Andean plateau to the north) as well as the equally, if not more important, bulk andesitic composition of the continental crust.    We here propose to acquire the detailed geophysical data needed to test whether current lithospheric structure is compatible with this process, as well as to fill in a critical gap in modern geophysical coverage along strike in a distinctive part of the central Andean plateau.  This project will involve deploying a total of 25 broadband and 45 intermediate-period three component seismic stations and employing a number of new and well-established techniques to image the details of the lithospheric seismic velocity structure and local seismicity patterns.   This is a truly international project in that it will benefit from the participation of scientists from the U.S., Germany, and South America.  The images will be integrated with the regional geology and the geochemical signature of relevant volcanism to form a robust geodynamic model for the evolution of the central Andean mountain belt.  We intend to study mantle dynamics and mantle flow associated with slab lithosphere using a combination of seismic tomographic methods (surface wave, body wave, and attenuation) as well as the large volume of prior geologic studies in this region to help constrain the extent, timing and amount of lithospheric removal within the southern Puna plateau.   This work will train a number of American, German, and Argentine students in modern seismological data acquisition and processing.  The study will contribute to improved understanding of the broader aspects of the earthquake and volcanic hazards in the Andes which have devastating potential, as well as the origin of natural resources in this classic mineral terrane. Lastly, this study serves as a forerunner and geodynamic reference for planned EARTHSCOPE investigations of older, comparable orogenic systems in the western U.S."

After the installation and initial engineering tests of this prototype system, it was used to make observations of the equatorial electrojet.  The equatorial electrojet is a sheet of current flowing in the ionosphere around the earth at the magnetic equator.  The plasma instabilities in the equatorial electrojet are still not well understood even after forty years of study by rockets and radars.

This award supports theoretical and computational research in the area of protein folding and the solution of inverse problems. The PI plans to apply a successful solution search strategy in the area of phase retrieval to the problem of protein folding. The key elements of this method are constraint projections in a Euclidean space that with minimal effort restore a particular constraint to an arbitrary input point. Many problems can be formulated in terms of their solution points being in the intersection of just two constraint sets. For such problems a dynamical system can be defined in terms of the corresponding constraint projections with the solution to the set intersection problem encoded in its fixed points. Constraint based algorithms are the method of choice in phase retrieval and may offer significant advantages, over mainstream sampling algorithms, in protein structure prediction.  As in phase retrieval, where a significant computational advantage is conferred by overdetermined constraint sets, a similar gain is expected when folding sequences that are well designed. Experiments with simple heteropolymer models of proteins, where the two constraints correspond to chain geometry and monomer packing, show promise that this approach can be extended to realistic models. This project will also develop a novel form of distributed computing made possible by the chaotic dynamics of the constraint based search.    The next generation of scientists and engineers will increasingly rely on shared data bases and standardized computing protocols in the conduct of their work. A significant component of this project is the development of a miniature realization of such a work environment called \"semiprotein world\". Semiproteins are model proteins with highly simplified properties, but which pose many of the same challenges posed by real proteins.

The design of semiprotein world will involve on-site participation of Ithaca area high school students and undergraduates in the Cornell Center for Materials Research NSF-REU program.    NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:    The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences contribute funding to this award which falls under the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area and contributes to cyberinfrastructure. This award supports theoretical and computational research in the area of protein folding. Proteins are major constituents of biological cells and play important roles in structure and function in living organisms. In order to carry out their biological function, the protein undergoes a kind of self-assemble to assume a particular shape or fold. The shape of a folded protein, how it folds and how it does it so quickly are key fundamental questions in understanding its function. Currently exiting computer simulation methods are very computationally intense. Here the PI will exploit fundamental connections between the problem of protein folding and microscopies that seek to develop an image from imperfect data, e.g. x-ray diffraction, to further develop a powerful new algorithm for protein folding to overcome the barrier of long simulation time. Preliminary results suggest that the algorithm will be far more computationally efficient than current methods.    The next generation of scientists and engineers will increasingly rely on shared data bases and standardized computing protocols in the conduct of their work.

In each scenario, as the number of parallel queues increases, the complexity of the decision-making process increases. Thus, finding the structure of the optimal policy in order to decrease the size of the search becomes crucial. The first problem considered is a question of routing in a multi-server queueing system that appears in several areas of industry. For example, in demand chain logistics a company receives a request for a particular part. This part may be manufactured at several different plants in the same general area. If the company has an integrated information source, a decision-maker can query the system about how much work is in process at each of the several plants, estimate the time (and cost) it will take each plant to complete the job at hand and place the order accordingly. We next take the same routing problem described above and consider scheduling in a particular manufacturing plant. If there are several stations capable of performing the same task, the applicability of the previous model remains. We complicate matters a bit, by noting that some of the machines may deteriorate. We then seek a joint, maintenance and routing policy. Finally, we consider an example of load balancing that is useful in parallel computing. Sup-pose that work orders can be broken up, partially served on any computer and, upon completion, reassembled. Since the computers are networked, and a decision-maker would like to utilize these resources wisely, it may be advantageous to re-route work that has been sitting in queue at a particular machine to a different machine. That is to say, that the decision-maker would like to keep the load balanced between machines. The decision where a job will actually be processed is thus reevaluated so that idleness is reduced.  The main thrust of the education plan in this proposal is to try to increase the number of successful Minority graduate students in industrial engineering and operations research. This will be facilitated by several activities, not the least of which is to attempt to increase the number of minority graduate students at the University of Michigan. Close ties to the undergraduates in the Industrial and Operations Engineering Department (IOE) at the university will be developed through mentoring and increased financial support for under-represented minority graduate students will reduce teaching requirements.      This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004."

However, some of today's most important challenges in rendering, particularly rendering human beings, involve densely packed elements -- the hairs on a head, the threads in a shirt -- that are readily visible at ordinary distances.  Because the geometry is densely packed together, accuracy requires a full simulation of how light  reflects from hair to hair, or from thread to thread, before it gets to the eye.  However, these materials are difficult to work with: the parts are too numerous for a detailed simulation to be practical, but they are not small enough to be modeled as a continuous medium.  This research is exploring methods that can use both approaches at once without sacrificing accuracy.    Correctly rendering these dense aggregations is an important open problem in computer graphics, requiring fundamental theoretical and algorithmic advances to be solved.  Directly simulating multiple scattering on such intricate models is prohibitively costly, so in practice it is approximated by simple heuristics. However, for light-colored materials such as blond hair or white cotton, very little light is absorbed in a single interaction, so the visual appearance of these materials is significantly affected by multiple scattering. For correct results a complete scattering simulation is required.    This research project aims to efficiently simulate scattering in dense geometry by introducing an approximation of the whole aggregation as a continuous scattering medium.  This allows methods for volumetric light transport to be applied when possible while still using the detailed geometry when necessary. Constructing this approximation requires a fundamentally new understanding of the relationship between geometric and volumetric rendering.  Implementing the approximation will require new algorithms to be developed, and applying it will require improvements to the state of the art in volumetric rendering."

Explicit reclamation of memory is error-prone, but efficient in time and space. On the other  hand, automatic memory management via garbage collection eliminates memory errors, but requires a  heavyweight run-time system that imposes a certain amount of run-time and memory overhead.  The goal of this research is to explore novel compiler and run-time techniques for safe memory  management with explicit memory deallocation and without garbage collection.    Intellectual Merit     The PI will develop a  system that will provide memory management support for Java in the following forms:  - It will augment Java bytecodes with primitive instructions for explicit memory reclamation;  - It will provide novel compiler analyses and transformations to automatically augment programs   with explicit memory deallocation  - It will provide appropriate run-time support for explicit memory deallocation in an extended Java  virtual machine.  The proposed work will investigate two paradigms for memory management with explicit deallocation:  - Region-based memory management, which groups data objects together into regions and deallocates  all of the objects in each region at once.  - Individual object deallocation, which reclaims storage for one object at a time. This approach  will use a single operation free to deallocate one object instance at a time.  -This research will leverage advanced static analyses such as pointer and shape analyses as key components of the proposed system to enable the accurate and safe reclamation of memory.

In CTM, each processor core is divided into regions with integrated monitoring and test support, as well as the ability to push parameters (such as supply voltage)  below worst case recommended limits.  Guard bands are determined dynamically at runtime through a combination of localized stress testing and redundant safe operation on an adjacent unit with the same functionality.  These guard bands should be almost always lower than can be achieved statically at design time and therefore can yield additional performance or power savings.  Frequent periodic reassessment of guard bands permits the system to tolerate large, slow changes in environment (such as an increase in neutron flux with higher elevation) without having to resort to constant redundancy and its corresponding performance and power costs.  This support is implemented in multiple layers comprising the hardware microarchitecture, monitor, diagnostic, and control (local and global controllers and system level middleware).

Long-term, remote observations by the new autonomous radar in St. Croix will be used together with the Arecibo facility to assess the stability of the neutral mesosphere-lower-thermosphere (MLT) region, identifying the true cause of the layer structuring, and studying the plasma physics involved in producing the QP echoes.     Sporadic E layers and irregularities drastically affect HF and VHF radio wave propagation so the project also has space weather relevance.  The project will bring educational experiences in upper atmospheric research to the diverse undergraduate student body at UVI, as well as to graduate students at Cornell and Clemson University. Furthermore, the imaging radar on St. Croix will become part of the Arecibo facility and add to the capabilities of the Incoherent Scatter Radar and optical instrumentation. It will add coherent scatter capabilities to the Arecibo Observatory instrument cluster, accessible by the community for studies of sporadic E, mid-latitude spread F, and meteor echoes, among other topics of general interest. This is a multi-institution proposal with co-investigators and students from Cornell, Clemson, and UVI participating."

For such an understanding, use is made of a physics-based approach, i.e. one based solely on the global optimization of a potential energy function (including the role of the solvent), without the use of secondary-structure predictions, homology modeling, threading, etc.  Such an approach requires both a reliable potential function and an efficient procedure for global optimization; this project is concerned with the development and improvement of the required empirical potential function.  Initially, a united-residue (UNRES) potential function is used.  UNRES will be improved by crystal calculations, with inclusion of entropy.  Then the refined UNRES potential function will be converted to an all-atom treatment by Z-score optimization of the all-atom potential function with inclusion of hydration.  The UNRES potential function is being improved by generating decoys with Langevin dynamics and incorporating entropy efforts, using a hierarchical optimization procedure.  The all-atom potential function (including a Generalized-Born solvation model) will be improved by the same hierarchical optimization procedure used to improve the UNRES potential function.  The search procedures will be carried out by improvement of a Conformational Space Annealing (CSA) method.    This research will provide a basic understanding of the role of the inter-residue interactions that determine the conformational and folding properties of proteins, and will provide training, not only for the two co-workers carrying out this research, but also for several postdocs and graduate students working together with these co-workers.  Also, as was done during the current project period (when members of the group participated in outreach career exploration by 8th and 9th grade students from schools across New York State), graduate student and postdoc members of the group will participate in the Expanding Your Horizons in Math, Science, and Engineering program of Cornell University for primary school students."

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT       A. Problem: The green lacewing family (Chrysopidae) is a geographically widespread, biologically fascinating, and economically important group of predaceous insects. Nevertheless, its classification is in a very poor state. It is difficult (often impossible) to identify species of green lacewings accurately; many are not described or named; as a result, potentially valuable evolutionary, ecological and applied research with the group is hindered.          B. Goals & Scope of Research: The project's goal is to revise the classification and provide a phylogenetic (evolutionary) analysis of the largest tribe of green lacewings (Leucochrysini, ~200 species). This tribe is native to the New World; it ranges from the United States through most of South America. And, its classification is in the poorest state of any group of chrysopids.       C. Methods: The proposed study will be the first to apply modern (cladistic) methods of classification to the green lacewings. It will create and analyze a large dataset that includes previously unused characters from larval and adult morphology as well as comparative biology. The outcome of the work will be (a) descriptions, illustrations, and keys for identifying species and (b) a classification of the tribe that reflects evolutionary relationships among the included species. It is anticipated that the project's methodology and analysis will provide a useful and efficient template for chrysopid systematists worldwide.    II. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE & SOCIETAL BENEFITS  The project's evolutionary classification of the tribe Leucochrysini will enable the identification and investigation of a large proportion (>50%) of neotropical green lacewing species. Potential benefits from the classification fall into several categories:            A. Systematics & Evolution: First, the project will provide crucial new information for defining the evolutionary relationships among the diverse taxa in the poorly known insect family Chrysopidae. The information will also help elucidate how Chrysopidae is related to the other families in the order Neuroptera.            B. Biological Control & Applied Ecology: Green lacewings are among the most important predators that feed on insect pests of agricultural and horticultural crops. The project will enable the identification, study and use of neotropical lacewings as native biological control agents in pest management. Its comparative biological and evolutionary approach is especially important to biological control because it provides a predictive insight into the biological characteristics of species that are under consideration for use in specific agro-ecological situations.       C. Biodiversity & Conservation: Chrysopids have significant potential as quantifiable (third-trophic-level) bio-indicators in biodiversity assessments and in conservation projects. The project will supply systematic information that is essential to such applications.            D. Student Training. The project's synergistic collaboration with Latin American colleagues and students will stimulate and nurture additional studies on the systematics and diversity of neotropical insects. The PIs will encourage qualified students to pursue advanced taxonomic training at universities in the USA."

The proposed research seeks to explore this fine line by examining how the same intuitive processes that give rise to celebrated instances of creative insight also give rise to common superstition.  The focus of this research is on the widespread belief, even on the part of highly educated people, that one ought not to \"tempt fate\" because to do so would be to increase the chances of a bad outcome coming to pass.    The proposed research is designed to test a theoretical model of such beliefs that draws upon previous research indicating that the act of imagination involves many of the same processes and brain structures as perception, and so the mere act of imagining an event gives it an aura of reality that increases its subjective likelihood of occurrence.  Because negative outcomes often command more attention than positive outcomes, actions that put one at risk of such outcomes are likely to induce mental processes that make those outcomes seem particularly vivid, fluent, and familiar, and hence enhance their subjective likelihood.  The proposed research, then, seeks to understand a common category of superstition-based negative thinking that stands in marked contrast to the excessive optimism documented in most psychological research on the general population.  The proposed research will also examine the extent to which this theoretical model can help explain: (1) why people tend to be more optimistic about predicting events that have yet to be determined (e.g., a football game about to be played) than comparable events that have already been determined but whose outcome is not yet known (e.g., a videotaped football game), and (2) why people are reluctant to pursue \"sudden death\" strategies in which payoffs-good or bad-are resolved in one swift stroke rather than drawn out over time."

While most invasion research has focused on aboveground organisms (plants, animals), invasions in the soil can be equally important.  Foreign earthworm species are currently invading North American forests over a wide geographic area and are causing marked changes in the soil environment.  Previous NSF-funded research in two forested landscapes in New York State demonstrated that earthworm invasions had striking but complex effects on forest soils, altering the structure of soil profiles, and changing the dynamics of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.  This renewal project will address how earthworm invasions affect carbon and nitrogen dynamics by altering the soil food web. Stable isotopes (13C and 15N) will be used to explore how the flow of carbon and nitrogen through different soil components is related to shifts in soil food web structure as well as to flows into the above-ground food web via woodland salamander populations.  The research will be coupled with formal and non-formal K-12 education and outreach efforts, based on the idea that earthworm ecology is a powerful tool for engaging a broad diversity of people in thinking about soils and ecosystems."

Studies of adult mosquito Malpighian tubules in the lab of the principal investigator Beyenbach have uncovered new transport phenomena that stimulate research of epithelial transport in biological systems beyond insects.  For example, his finding in Malpighian tubules of a) the energizing of diverse epithelial transport systems with the V-type H+ ATPase and not the Na/K ATPase, b) the channel-like behavior of septate (tight) junctions, and c) the rapid regulation of paracellular permeability in the astonishing time domain of seconds, are motivating searches for similar phenomena in vertebrate tissues.  The present proposal is a logical extension of the above findings.  Hypothesis-driven experiments promise to discover new transport systems while exploring new ideas in transport physiology.  In Aim 1, the functional characterization of NHE8 (a Na-H transport protein) he has already cloned in Aedes Malpighian tubules may uncover the first electrogenic Na/H exchanger in any tissue, vertebrate or invertebrate.  Aim 2 applies proteomics and highly sensitive mass spec methods with the promise of identifying not only NHE8 but also new proteins, and potentially important new transporters in the apical membrane of the adult Malpighian tubule.  In Aim 3 he seeks to a) identify gap junctions, b) determine size and charge selectivity, c) explore the role of gap junctions in cell-to-cell transmission of Ca2+ waves that may mediate the signal transduction of leucokinin, and d) test the novel idea of the metabolic regulation of gap junctions.

These data, which have been gathered over a 20-year period by more than 1000 field stations across North America, provide detailed avian demographic information. Bringing this data resource to the AKN will create the most comprehensive source of environmental monitoring and conservation biology available. The data will be integrated into the AKN via a bird banding data exchange schema. This schema is based on the Darwin Core standard and is compatible with AKN's observational data schema. The goal is to expand the existing bird monitoring data exchange schema to include bird demographic data, and, specifically, to modify the schema to handle information gathered (age, sex, size, weight) on individual birds. The constant effort capture data will be federated using the DiGIR protocol. A data warehouse structure will archive these data and make them generally available. Finally, an Internet-based multi-scale analysis application will be developed and publicly released to a broad spectrum of users. The interdisciplinary approach will bring statistical and computational specialists together with population biologists to develop new and broadly applicable technologies to create new methodologies that track long-term environmental patterns at a range of scales. To allow rapid browsing of these data over the Internet, new strategies in data visualizations will be explored. This project will expose new data resources and advances in statistical analysis to vast new audiences: from biologists, conservation agencies, and land-use planners to school classrooms and thousands of citizens who participate in environmental monitoring. The project will open new scientific, conservation, and educational opportunities, and by actively disseminating data visualization and exploration applications it will enable researchers as well as literally millions of people across North America who watch and appreciate wild birds to access a vast resource focused on bird populations."

The digestive tract is a primary site interfacing with the environment and interacting with various physical, chemical and biological factors. Particularly, the extracellular matix lining of the gut, which is often a mucus layer in higher animals and is the peritrophic membrane (PM) in invertebrates (especially in insects), directly interfaces with the environment and serves as the first line of defense. Therefore, understanding of the formation and function of the PM is fundamental for understanding the interactions of insects with their plant or animal hosts, microorganisms and various abiotic factors from the environment. PMs are a unique extracellular matrix composed of chitin and proteins, and their structure and function are critically dependent on the proteins. The aim of this research is to understand the function of PM proteins in PM structure and formation. The function of PM proteins will be investigated by silencing the expression of individual PM protein genes in a Lepidoptera insect, Trichoplusia ni, to reveal the roles of the proteins in PM formation and by profiling the expression of individual PM protein genes in response to PM damage and to feeding on different host plants to examine the dynamic regulation of PM protein synthesis and their function in interaction with host plants. In addition, interactions of the major PM protein, the insect intestinal mucin, with other PM proteins will be examined and characterized to identify the role of protein-protein interaction in the PM structure and formation. This proposed research is expected to result in a broad and in-depth understanding of the molecular properties and function of the PM, which will advance the understanding of the PM in the areas of insect physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology and facilitate the understanding of the interactions of insects with the environment, including their host plants/animals, microorganisms and other environmental factors. The knowledge derived from this project may direct development of new strategies for the control of agriculturally and medically important insect pests for public welfare.

This gland produces oily secretions. Multiple times a day birds use their beak to spread these secretions over their feathers. It has long be known that this behavior is essential for maintaining feathers in good condition because applying these secretions to feathers keeps them supple and malleable. Previous studies have shown that although most birds produce secretions, the chemical composition varies between bird species. Secretion composition also changes seasonally, and may differ between males and females. In warmer weather secretions contain a larger number of chemical components than during cooler periods. In and on bird feathers numerous organisms can be found. These include bacteria, fungi, mites, lice and other arthropods. Many of these organisms are harmful to the birds, and it can be hypothesized that preen-gland secretions would play an important role in protecting the bird against them. The objective of this proposal is to describe the very complex chemical composition of preen-gland secretions, to determine how these vary in time and space within a single species, and to test the effect the secretions have on parasitic bacteria, fungi and arthropods. The research will lead to the discovery and identification of new chemical compounds and determine which of these have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-lice and miticidal effects. Some of these chemicals may have novel structures that are not produced by other living organisms. Such compounds could be of great value in veterinary sciences (poultry), and could perhaps even have applications for medicinal use."

DC3000 pathogenesis is dependent on the type III secretion system (TTSS), which translocates many effector proteins into plant cells. An important function of some effectors, such as AvrPto, is suppression of basal resistance (innate immunity) in plants. P. syringae also secretes several proteins through the TTSS that appear to be targeted to the plant apoplast rather than the cytoplasm. These \"apoplast Hops\" (Hrp outer proteins) include two proteins with a lytic transglycosylase domain: HopP1 and CEL (conserved effector locus) ORF1. The latter is encoded adjacent to the hrp/hrc genes encoding the TTSS. A P. syringae hrp/hrc cluster, cloned in P. fluorescens, enables this nonpathogen to translocate AvrPto into plant cells and to suppress basal resistance. Remarkably, P. fluorescens expressing the TTSS and either HopP1 or CEL ORF1 suppresses basal resistance in the absence of any effector. The specific objectives of this project are to: (i) identify all P. syringae tomato DC3000 apoplast Hops and test their ability to either elicit or suppress the hypersensitive response and basal resistance; (ii) determine the basis for the innate ability of the P. syringae TTSS to suppress basal resistance when expressed in a nonpathogen; (iii) construct mutations in P. s. tomato DC3000 and test the functions of apoplast Hops during interactions with host plants. This project should yield new insights into the TTSS and innate immunity, two factors important in bacterium-host interactions involving both plant and animal pathogens.

Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multimodular enzymes that make small non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) through a mechanism, independent of organelles best known for protein synthesis, the ribosomes. To date, the NRPS method of peptide biosynthesis has been described for filamentous ascomycete fungi (and to a limited extent, for basidiomycete fungi) and for bacteria, only. The diversity of possible NRP products is potentially limitless as NRPs can be composed of D- and L-amino acids, protein and non-protein amino acids, hydroxy acids, ornithine, and other unusual constituents. Furthermore, NRPs can be linear, cyclic, or branched cyclic, and may be modified by glycosylation, N-methylation or acylation. In addition to structural diversity, NRPs have an astonishingly broad spectrum of biological activities.   However, despite the fact that activities of the peptide products, with respect to interactions with other organisms, are well documented, and certainly remarkable, to suggest that this is their primary function is likely incorrect. For example, only one of the 12 C. heterostrophus NPS genes is required for virulence on the host, maize. In fact, the physiological significance of these small peptides to the producing fungi is largely unknown. The foundation of this project is the hypothesis that NRPS enzymes are purveyors of small molecules for both basal metabolism and for specialized environmental niches.  The goals of this project are to create a library of C. heterostrophus NPS- deletion strains that will be used to resolve roles that small molecule, non-ribosomal peptides play in the biology of the fungal cell. Specifically, experiments are designed to: A. Create multiple NPS gene-deletion strains. B. Create strains in which each NPS gene is overexpressed. C. Perform a series of phenotypic assays to explore function. D. Determine conditions under which NPS genes are expressed. E. Perform chemical analyses on wild-type and selected mutant strains with interesting phenotypes, to identify NRP structure.      This research will allow the development of an optional research module for a popular undergraduate biology course.  This outreach collaboration program will expose and help move students into the science pipeline by interweaving and disseminating excitement about the second largest group of organisms on earth, the fungi.  Interested students will be invited to one or two sessions where they will be introduced to the concept of NRPSs.  Then, students will be assigned to assist with and eventually take charge of phenotypic assays.

(3) Sub-carrier modulation will be applied to multiphoton imaging and will be used to develop a new fast imaging technique that is compatible with deep imaging in a scattering environment.     The instruments to be developed will significantly extend the capability of multiphoton microscopy in biological research.   Multiphoton microscopy is already an indispensable tool in biological imaging, and this research will help to solve the following two difficulties so that this microscopy can reach its full potential: (1) How to see deeper into tissues and (2) How to image faster.

These problems stem fundamentally from the fact that current distributed systems lack principled design and depend on unreliable heuristics for their operation.    We are investigating new techniques for building robust, high-performance infrastructure services, based on novel analytical and numerical techniques for optimally or near-optimally performing resource allocation in large-scale distributed systems. We are developing new techniques that enable a new generation of highly reliable, self-organizing infrastructure services.  In particular, we are developing a next-generation name service to replace the Domain Name Service that seamlessly supports the existing name hierarchy, a high-performance web cache that achieves predictably high performance by delivering hot data items close to clients proactively, and an eternal software repository that minimizes download time for swarming, bittorrent-style downloads.     This work lays a foundation for a principled understanding of resource tradeoffs in distributed systems that are currently performed either manually or in an ad hoc fashion. The new techniques are directly applicable to self-organizing peer-to-peer systems and lead to performance,   manageability and availability properties that are difficult to achieve via conventional means. The application of these techniques to the implementation of infrastructure services will yield more robust replacements for fragile and expensive services, such as DNS, web caches, and software distribution than we use today."

Despite the universitys commitment, gender diversity remains a significant problem that affects the quality of Cornells enterprise.  The representation of women faculty in science and engineering (S&E) falls below the level of female PhDs produced nationally. The NSF ADVANCE program provides a unique opportunity to increase the number of women S&E faculty at Cornell and thereby positively affect the universitys environment. The proposed goals are ambitious: over the five year life of the grant, achieve 20% women faculty in each S&E Department and increase the number of senior women S&E faculty. A 20% target was chosen to move the representation of women from token status to a critical mass in each department, the environment that most determines faculty daily life. At present 27 of the 51 S&E departments are below this critical mass. The more ambitious longer-term objective is that a third of the S&E faculty be women by 2015, Cornell Universitys sesquicentennial.  The approach to institutional change described in this proposal is based on the following principles:  successful implementation of diversity strategies requires genuine support from high levels of an organization; inequalities that result from forces external to the institution can be effectively addressed by institutional policies and strategies; accountability for achieving diversity goals reduces biases against women and minorities; and, representation below 15-20% of a unit heightens the visibility of women, leading to a series of barriers to advancement. Achieving the projects short- and longer-term goals requires a commitment not only to recruitment, but also to retention, development, and promotion of women faculty, which will be achieved through the efforts detailed in this proposal.  The main thrust of this proposal is to create an integrated campus wide set of initiatives and to ensure their implementation and success through the creation of the CU-ADVANCE center, that will permanently reside in the Provosts Office. As is common with elite, private universities, decision-making and policy design and implementation are highly decentralized at Cornell. As a result, past efforts to increase the representation of women faculty have been fragmented across colleges and departments, with no easy way for best practices to be shared. For this reason, the majority of the budget is for programs and support staff that will connect faculty and decision makers across departments and colleges in a way that would not be possible otherwise and for a on-going university wide evaluation of progress in each area. Cornell has a rich history of inclusion of women and many womens firsts in higher education. With an ADVANCE grant, Cornell can return to its commitment to leadership by demonstrating that reaching a critical mass of women scientists and engineers at an elite, research-intensive institution is possible, and more generally that the advancement of women scientists and engineers can and should include such institutions.  Intellectual Merit  In addition to the proposed direct efforts toward recruitment, retention, promotion, and development, two sociological studies will be conducted as part of the formative and summative  evaluation strategies. A longitudinal study of assistant professors will elucidate whether and how the experiences of women and men faculty differ and will determine which barriers to advancement are unique to women in S&E, which affect all women faculty, and which are common to all faculty. These results will help identify and isolate factors that differentially contribute to the career success of men and women. A second study will examine the impact of changes in the demographic composition of departments on social relations among faculty members. To date, no research has been conducted on the dynamic aspects of gender composition, though understanding these dynamics clearly is an important outcome of increasing  the number of women faculty.  Broader Impact  Women S&E faculty at several neighboring institutions will participate in workshops and seminars throughout the grant period. In addition to affecting the Cornell faculty, this grant will  indirectly influence future S&E faculty nationwide. A majority of Cornells bachelors (60%) and doctoral (80%) degrees are conferred in science and engineering fields. An unusually large number of our female and male undergraduates later receive doctoral degrees, and, in fact, Cornell ranks third as the undergraduate institution where women engineering faculty were trained. The presence of greater numbers of female faculty at Cornell will, therefore, have a truly transformational impact nationally."

While traditional methods for fault-tolerance rely on passive measures such as redundancy, safety margins, and preventative maintenance, this project will develop a new active approach. This approach continuously reconstructs models of the current system from sensory data, and uses these models to assess failure and uncertainty, and to generate compensatory actions using design automation in-situ. This approach will be applied and evaluated on both quasi-static systems and dynamical systems across various scales and complexities.    If successful, the broader impacts of this research will lead to improvements in the ability of systems to autonomously identify and warn about potential failure, and even sustain operation and recover from some forms of damage. As systems are becoming increasingly complex, there is a need to transition from passive fault tolerance to active fault tolerance, where systems that can diagnose and repair faults autonomously. The method proposed here is domain-independent, and as such may be applied across many complex systems beyond those explicitly addressed in the proposed work, such as modeling of biological systems and medical diagnosis.    Educational activities will focus both on expansion of undergraduate curriculum in design for fault tolerance, and on a broader outreach program whose goal is to enhance hands-on engineering and science education for children and students through a library of 3D-printable educational models across several scientific fields"

New configurations and functionality will be explored through research on photonic crystals with nonspherical and active colloids as bases. Realization of photonic band gap materials (photonic crystals) operating in the near infrared and visible regions relies on ordered lattices of monodispersed, or uniform sized, nano- and mesoscale particles. This overcomes limitations of traditional colloidal building blocks such as silica (SiO2) and polystyrene spheres, which have poor optical function (low refractive index) and cannot produce the diverse packing arrangements necessary to fulfill the most promising enhancements in optical properties expected from photonic crystals. Monodispersed colloids with functionality (metals, semiconductors, magnetic ceramics, etc.) are promising for a variety of electrooptic applications, but have not been widely available. In the proposed research, techniques to expand colloid composition and morphology control will be studied to produce high refractive index monodispersed colloids including non-spherical, core-shell,hollow, and luminescent particles. Fields and templates made by lithography will be utilized in addition to self-assembly strategies to organize the particles.

The objective of the proposed research is three-fold. First, to quantify the effect of architecture on diffusion, stress relaxation, and near-surface composition profile of single-component branched polymers and their blends with linear chains. Second, to determine how topology of charged analytes influence their electrophoretic properties in polymer gels and solutions. Finally, to understand how molecular architecture affects nonlinear rheological behavior of polymers in transient shear and extensional flows. The proposed research employs anionic techniques and DNA self-assembly to synthesize model symmetric star and asymmetric H-shaped polymer structures. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) is used in conjunction with mechanical rheometry to quantify the effect of arm length and arm length asymmetry on the self-diffusion coefficient and viscoelastic properties (linear and non-linear) of branched molecules. These measurements are important because they simultaneously allow the dynamic dilution ansatz to be tested and reveal the fundamental processes that govern branch-point diffusion in quiescent and highly deformed polymer liquids. RBS will also be used in conjunction with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to quantify the composition profile of branched/linear additives in polymer hosts. Results from these experiments will be compared with predictions from  self-consistent field simulations and a recently proposed response theory to determine how/why additives migrate in polymers. Implications of such migration for polymer surface functionalization and plasticizer design will be explored in detail. Branched DNA synthesized by self-assembly will be used to visualize, quantify, and model electrophoresis of polyelectrolytes with complex topologies in polymer gels and entangled solutions.                                                                                                                                                 NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY  Annual production of polyolefins with multiple long side branches per molecule exceeds 20 billion pounds in the United States alone. These polymers are inexpensively synthesized, but the best procedures for shaping them into useful articles (e.g. interior panels for automobiles, grocery sacks, and beverage containers) are rarely obvious. The complexity comes from a lack of fundamental understanding of how side branches affect polymer flow properties, and how these properties in-turn affect processing. As a result, months of expensive trial-and-error experimentation are often required to modify existing polymer processing equipment to accommodate polymers with even small amounts of long side branches. The research proposed seeks to synthesize ideal branched polymers with well-defined molecular topologies using anionic synthesis and DNA self-assembly. Branched polymers in the first group will be used in this project to investigate the effect of molecular architecture on flow properties.  Branched molecules created by DNA self-assembly will be used to visualize molecular motions and to devise new, efficient methods for sequencing DNA. In addition to its direct impact on science and technology of polymer processing, the proposed study is expected to impact education in at least three ways. First, the proposed visualization experiments using DNA will provide an important visual component and/or demonstration tool for teaching polymer physics to students at all levels. Second, the team of graduate and undergraduate students who will execute the study will receive comprehensive education in a unique combination of subjects: polymer physics, synthetic chemistry, fluid dynamics, polymer processing, optics and spectroscopy, molecular biology, and molecular theory. Finally, the PI and his students will disseminate knowledge created in the project to students and local industry via an outreach program for K-12 students, science teachers in Ithaca, and local industry. This program, administered through Cornell Center for Materials Research, provides unique opportunities for influencing how young students learn science and how local companies take advantage university research for enhancing  their competitiveness."

Famous examples of private goods that have been stigmatized include the injection of cyanide in Tylenol bottles and mad cow disease with beef. Fear of food contamination has gone so far as to eliminate the market for some foods (including 93% decreases of sales of some meats in countries like Australia). Many public goods have been stigmatized as well. For example, the public water supply for Woburn, Massachusetts, was contaminated by hazardous wastes, the story of the resulting lawsuit entitled \"A Civil Action\" went on to become a best-selling book and movie. In this and other toxic waste cleanups, stigma caused quasi-permanent losses in nearby property values even after extensive cleanup costing upwards of $600 million dollars. This apparent failure of some public and private goods to recover from stigma provides the societal motivation for this proposed experimental research. Given the potentially large economic consequences of stigma, an experimental-behavioral economics examination (with co-PIs from both consumer psychology and economics) is warranted that focuses on methodologies to mitigate stigma. The research motivation arises from the experimental psychology literature on stigma, which is imaginative and compelling. The proposed research will examine how the value of both private and public goods changes when they are stigmatized and attempt to find methods to restore those values. Strategies to reduce stigma, including prevention of contamination, testing to demonstrate safety, and decontamination will be explored in an experimental setting for biological, chemical, nuclear, and accidental sources of risk. Building on preliminary findings, experiments will also be conducted which help to determine the psychological process behind the valuation of goods.  The experiments will be designed to satisfy the standards for basic research in both experimental economics and in psychology. The results of the research will be of use both to private companies and public agencies that face stigmatization from contamination, design flaws, disease, random events, or terrorism."

The students will mix with other summer program attendees at Cornell, take part in summer activities within the Space Sciences Department, attend a bi-weekly summer lecture series on various Astronomical topics, and will present their findings at a Summer Student Research Seminar.  Students may also accompany their mentors on trips to facilities such as Arecibo Observatory, Kitt Peak National Observatory, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Green Bank), or Mt. Palomar.      The program to-date has served a range of students, some of whom go on to careers in astronomy, and some of whom find that the experience sets them on a different career path, yet one that is well served by involvement in the REU program."

In particular, four projects relating to geometrical studies of frustrated and diluted antiferromagnets will be investigated.    1. Strongly interacting fermions and reduced density matrices: The correlation density matrix  method allows the detection of all possible correlation functions, given a wavefunction from exact diagonalization. It will be tested on systems believed to have rapidly decaying correlations. Renormalization groups (RG) for strongly correlated systems will be revisited, to clarify the relationships or comparisons between (i) contractor renormalization (CoRE); (ii) cluster dynamical mean-field theory; and (iii) the matrix-product ansatz of DM-RG to dimensions d > 1. Also, strong-coupling ladder and d = 2 spinless fermion models will be exhibited on which spontaneous currents develop as a symmetry breaking.    2. Highly frustrated antiferromagnets: An effective Hamiltonian will be derived (by numerical fitting  or analytics) from the quartic-order spinwave zero-point energy for the large-S Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice.  A semiclassical approach will be developed for S = 1, S = 3=2, or S = 2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice, based on tunneling between the discrete coplanar states. Magnetization relaxation in spin-ice pyrochlores will be modeled in terms of the coarse-grained polarization and a semiconductor analogy. A long-wavelength theory will be written to describe the helimagnetism in (highly frustrated) spinel CdCr2O4 due (probably) to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya anisotropy and lattice distortions.    3. Height models and Rokhsar-Kivelson points :  A hypothetical antiferromagnet with Ising-like  anisotropic exchange in a large field will be mapped to the quantum dimer model, and its spin structure factor calculated. The dimer model will also be studied near the maximum tilt limit in which configurations are mapped to an array of non-crossing, transversely wandering lines. Models will be concocted with topological order, labeled by the simplest discrete groups, and simulated as classical systems.     4. Heisenberg antiferromagnet at percolation: The renormalization group of Chakravarty, Halperin, and Nelson will be translated to the fractal lattice of a critical percolation cluster.    Intellectual merit    The intellectual focus is on strongly correlated magnetic systems which derive from local geometry causing frustration among spins.  These are core issues in modern condensed matter physics.  Most of these projects attempt to open up some new tools, not for a grand swath of physics but for particular topics of current interest: tricks for calculating effective Hamiltonians (part 2), models as playgrounds of topological order (part 3), a novel variety of RG (part 4). When it worked, (like our recent gauge-like effective Hamiltonian), I think the results were elementary, elegant, and unexpected; these projects, if successful, would be similar.    Broader impacts    The grant will contribute to the education and training of students.  The primary broader impact is through advances in intellectual merit.  Highly frustrated magnets (part 2 of proposal) may well have interesting thermopower properties since they are usually insulators but have large specific heats due to many nearly degenerate states. Also, topological order (part 3) is being energetically pursued in frustrated models with the motivation of quantum computation.  Projects 2.3, 2.4, and 4 especially relate to recent neutron-diffraction or magnetic relaxation experiments that are curiosity-driven. In many projects (1.1, 2.2, 3.2, and 4), I hope to get access to the data of computational physicists and to assist their work."

Escobedo    Designing Novel Nano- and Micro-structured Materials via Molecular Simulation    Intellectual Merit: The goal of this related project is to develop and apply novel molecular simulation methods to study the liquid-crystalline phase behavior and rheology of systems containing rigid colloidal nano-particles of atypical geometry. The motivation for this research is the growing ability to experimentally produce nano- and micro-particles of almost any imaginable shape, This goal lies within the scope of nanotechnology that seeks to achieve greater control of positional assembly of nanoscale objects; in this case, by identifying promising building blocks that can lead to novel self-assembled structures. In this context, particle-shape complementarity plays the role of an \"entropic bonding\" that helps orient and position particles in regular patterns (even in the absence of chemical selectivity). The particle shapes to be investigated include tetragonal parallelepipeds or \"cuboids\" that may lead to cubatic and other novel biaxial mesophases. Selected binary and polydisperse mixtures of these particle types will be considered, including mixtures of large and small cuboids (which may lead to the coexistence of multiple liquid-crystal phases), and mixtures of complementarily shaped particles (which may lead to micro-assembled phases). The models used are coarse-grained representations of colloidal particles (organic aggregates or surface-functionalized inorganic particles) whose effective inter-particle interactions can be tuned by the composition of the solvent media. The steady shear-flow rheology of cuboidal suspensions will also be simulated. It is envisioned that the mesophases formed may exhibit unusual shear responses including strong flow directionality (e.g., a weak dependence on shear direction) and yield stress behavior.    The methodological developments to be pursued are: (i) Extension of expanded ensemble methods to simulate mesophase transitions in pure components and asymmetric binary systems, (ii) development of a general framework to map out free-energy landscapes over any suitable order-parameters that may be needed to negotiate large barriers between mesophases, and (iii) adaptation of dissipative particle dynamics to simulate the shear rheology of novel colloidal mesophases.   The project can thus be seen as having a dual scope. The primary goal is to elucidate the behavior of model rigid polymer and colloidal systems that have potential uses in the nanotechnology of self-assembly; e.g., by studying the effect of entropic forces and shear flow on the onset and endurance of ordered mesophases. The secondary goal is to formulate novel numerical statistical mechanics techniques that have potentially widespread applications.    Broader Impacts: This project is complementary to experimental efforts by collaborators who will try to realize the predicted novel phases and test their mechanical, optical, and rheological properties. In the long term, the results could impact the ceramic, plastics, and semiconductor industries by helping broaden the approaches available to develop strong nanocomposites with high particle loadings, sieves with regular topology and pore-sizes, colloid-based mesocrystals for light control in photonic materials, and sensors and lubricants sensitive to stress directionality. The advances in simulation methods should also help industrial materials modelers in their efforts to improve product properties by predicting and exploiting meso-scale phenomena and hierarchical structure.    The graduate and undergraduate students involved with this project will gain a good understanding of the properties of colloids while acquiring a significant expertise on molecular and mesoscopic modeling. The scientific results will be disseminated through professional meetings and an industrial outreach program organized by the Cornell Center for Material Research (CCMR). Results of this investigation will be used in at least three courses: a new course on molecular simulations, a recently developed problem-based core graduate course, and the advanced thermodynamics core course. Educational outreach efforts will include mentoring of undergraduate researchers and participation in the work of the Educational Programs Office of CCMR."

Particular emphasis will be placed on issues of definability and automorphisms. Also included in this area is the analysis of the relations between the difficulty of computing functions and other issues such as rates of growth, complexity of their definitions in arithmetic and the strength of axiom systems needed to prove their existence (reverse mathematics). The emphasis in reverse mathematics will be on analyzing basic combinatorial principles that seem to lie outside the scope of the standard theories studied. Applications of the methods of pure computability theory will be made in the areas of model theory and notions used in differential geometry. The emphasis in computable model theory will be on the ways in which choosing different representations of a given structure affect the computational complexity of various relations or procedures on the elements of the structure. Issues in automata theory and especially automatic structures that deal with computable complexity will also be addressed.        The proposed project includes research into a broad range of topics in computability theory (recursion theory) and logic both theoretical and applied to other areas of mathematics and computer science. At the foundational level, this work illuminates the nature of relative complexity of computation, the strength of axioms needed to prove standard mathematical theorems and the relations between these areas. In practical terms, results in this area (computable mathematics and model theory as well as reverse mathematics)  at times indicate that there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more information than might have been expected is needed to write programs calculating the desired results. The work related to automata theory and automatic structures is based on a very limited model of computation that is often relevant to practical computing problems. The theoretical and foundational analysis of structures whose basic relations and functions are computable by such automata should also eventually be of practical significance."

The basic algebraic structure underlying these questions is the algebra of quasisymmetric functions, which generalizes the classical algebra of symmetric functions.  Early results have shown that a generalization of a fundamental enumerative invariant for counting faces in convex polytopes - the cd-index - also provides a convenient way of representing the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a Bruhat interval in terms of classical polynomials arising in the enumeration of lattice paths.  A focus of the project is to study the behavior of this generalized cd-index over the class of Bruhat intervals.  An unrelated area of interest is the geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees.  A goal here is to determine an efficient scheme to compute distances between trees in this space.     The study of the basic properties of polyhedra has been with us since the Greeks.  One fundamental question, studied for hundreds of years, has to do with the relationship between the numbers of sides, edges and corners in such an object.  Similar questions exist for high-dimensional analogs of polyhedra, which occur naturally in the analysis of methods to solve optimization problems arising in diverse areas such as resource allocation, industrial production and the design of communication networks.  This project is focusing on techniques to analyze these counting problems.  Recently it has been shown that these techniques are also useful in the study of fundamental properties of objects arising in the study of symmetry, for example, in theoretical physics.  An unrelated direction is the study of phylogenetic trees, which are of basic interest in evolutionary biology.  Here the aim is to develop methods to compute the distance between two such trees, a basic step in recently developed techniques to apply statistical methods to the profusion of tree data now being derived from the study of the structure of DNA in various species.  Research on this project will also continue the investigator's training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates, all of whom have gone on to positions as college or university faculty or as research staff in industrial or government laboratories."

These devices, although too small to be seen by eye, ranging in size from 100 microns (about 1 tenth of a mm) to 100 nanometers (about 1 ten-thousandth of a mm), may contain many intricately shaped mechanical components, sensors and circuits.     One particularly promising type of NEMS contains nanometer scale beams and plates (let's call them nanobeams).  As Xylophone bars vibrate in response to percussion, nanobeams can vibrate in response to \"input signals\" which could be electrical or mechanical in nature.  Due to their small size and low damping, nanobeams can behave differently than their large scale counterparts.  For example, such beams are known to vibrate spontaneously (self-oscillate) when illuminated with DC (steady) laser light.  These self-oscillations can be synchronized to a modulated (AC) laser or other external modulation. If many self-oscillating nanobeams were placed in an array and connected mechanically they could vibrate in different patterns depending on the input signal and the manner in which each nanobeam is connected to the others in the array. An array of such coupled oscillators could be used for sensing, signal processing and timing applications.     The proposed research integrates experiments and theory to understand the function of the vibrating nanobeams and their arrays, to discover new phenomena and to find ways to minimize the power needed to drive the oscillators.  We propose to develop simplified mathematical models practical for design purposes.  Predictions of the simplified models will be compared to full models and to experiments. These models will be applied to study the dynamics of large systems of oscillators with the goal of obtaining insights into the design challenges for applications of oscillator arrays. Findings of the study will provide a pathway to the real-world application of arrays for signal processing and other applications.  A hands-on oscillator module will be developed and used with middle school students and with middle or high school teachers."

Four areas  will receive   special emphasis:  triangulations  of compact manifolds, Cohen-Macaulay   complexes,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids. It has   been over 100 years since the introduction of the Euler-Poincare   formula, yet the combinatorial properties of triangulations of compact   manifolds remain largely unknown.  Indeed, a complete characterization   of all possible f-vectors (which record the number of faces in each   dimension) is not known for any manifold of dimension five or more.     The possible f-vectors of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complexes have been   known since the foundational work of Hochster, Reisner and Stanley in   the 1970's.  However, the classification of face counts for important   subclasses, such as spheres and doubly Cohen-Macaulay complexes,   remains a fundamental open problem in algebraic and topological   combinatorics.   Even though the representation theory of finite groups   is an extremely well developed subject, tools for computing many   topological invariants, such as Betti numbers, for the corresponding   spherical quotients are practically nonexistent.  Matroids are a   combinatorial abstraction of linear independence which can be modeled   through a variety of topological spaces.  Their enumerative properties   have    many applications including coloring and flows on graphs,   network reliability, and the topology of hyperplane arrangements    Two recurrent and complementary ideas in mathematics are the   approximation of continuous phenomena using discrete data, and modeling   the latter with smooth objects, such as spheres or polyhedra.  The   guiding principle of this project is that the combination of these two   techniques  is a powerful method of approaching both situations.  For instance, compact manifolds, which are frequently presented as   solutions to nonsingular polynomial equations in several variables, can   also be examined by using simplicial complexes which are easier to   encode into a computer.  In turn, this allows a deeper study of the   shape and geometry of the original space."

In the complex dynamics direction, the aim is to make a connection between some of the ideas behind the recent advances in dynamics of one complex variable and two dimensional dynamics. The PI proposes a scheme for using methods from dynamics in one complex variable and computer tools to construct symbolic codings which could lead to understanding two dimensional diffeomorphisms. He also proposes methods to explore structure in parameter space through the monodromy of Julia sets. The PI also deals with the classical dynamical behavior of  trajectories on rational polygonal tables. The questions involving the dynamics of the billiard flow translate into questions involving an action of the special linear group on the moduli space of translation structures. The problem is to understand and geometrically characterize orbits of this action.          Mathematical models that describe how systems change with time provide essential insights in many areas of science. They are used to describe the rhythms of the heart, the pulsing of lasers and the spread of disease. When the models are nonlinear the long term behavior, or dynamics, of these models can be chaotic and the dependence of the dynamics on the parameters of the model can be extraordinarily delicate. This is true even in very simple models. The potential impact of a deeper understanding of nonlinear dynamics is profound and could be felt in many areas of science. One aim of this proposal is to determine how computational and theoretical methods interact in exploring families of dynamical systems. Answers to such questions could have broad impact as questions about how best to use computers arise in many scientific areas. The study of polygonal billiards ties together some very simple dynamical systems with intuitive appeal with some deep questions about the structure of certain moduli spaces that are the focus of interest from many viewpoints including algebraic geometry algebraic topology and string theory.

Such devices require the use of photonic structures, such as photonic crystals, which confine light in small dimensions and enhance light emission in specific directions through redistribution of the photonic density of states. Such structures are usually limited in size to the order of the wavelength of light, which in turn induces a limited enhancement of the light emission efficiency, proportional to the degree of confinement. Here it is proposed to remove this limitation on the degree of light confinement by demonstrating extremely low optical modal volumes experimentally. The ability to increase the confinement of light well beyond the levels achieved with traditional photonic structures has the potential for increased light emission as well as modulation.     Broader Impacts:  The fundamental knowledge gained by studying strong light confining structures for increased light emission has direct importance for a wide variety of novel applications such as amplification, sensing, lasing and switching that can be massively integrated on a chip-scale. As part of the educational effort it is proposed to develop an educational program for exposing students to photonics as an interdisciplinary area and enhancing the undergraduate and graduate Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum in the area of photonics. An interdisciplinary seminar series will be developed for undergraduate and graduate students, and novel subjects of photonics will be introduced through lectures and laboratories in two courses in the ECE department at Cornell University."

The PI aims to elucidate quantum orderings, both in hydrogen and in hydrogen alloyed with other light element systems. Of increasing prominence in these systems is the enduringly fundamental and pragmatic area of superconductivity, impelled by the recent and quite dramatic discovery of superconductivity occurring in compressed lithium with a transition temperature which is now the highest of any element. That this could be a possibility was already raised in research supported by the previous grant and companion predictions that the hitherto 'simple' elements would adopt structures of considerable complexity at similar conditions were also swiftly borne out by experiment. It is remarkable that many of the elements hitherto regarded as 'simple' are observed to take up structures at higher densities even exhibiting incommensurabilities. And it is surely also noteworthy that the light elements in the especial combination MgB2 have had such a significant impact on the field of superconductivity.      A major theme of the research is spurred by striking recent advances in experimental high pressure physics. The PI aims to elucidate the physics of the superconducting state, and particularly the role of electronic fluctuation in multi-band and quasi-localized contexts. High temperature superconductivity has long been predicted to occur in metallic phases of hydrogen and now more recently in hydrogen dominant metallic alloys. Further development of the theory for this class of system seems in order, especially to explore the possibility of further orderings that might accompany sublattice melting. For pure hydrogen itself, co-existence of superfluidity and superconductivity has been predicted for liquid metallic (near) ground states, and extension of the theory now to the mixed symmetry system embodied by liquid metallic deuterium is an interesting avenue to pursue, again with an eye towards experimental realization. The vortex characteristics, resulting either from applied magnetic fields or from rotation, may be unusual. In electronic terms all of these systems are highly inhomogeneous, as guaranteed by the cusp theorem, and it is also proposed to further develop weighted density and related approaches to the density functional viewpoint of the associated electronic structures, both for energetics and for effective interactions.         NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This award supports theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics focused mainly on the light elements, including hydrogen under extermes of pressure and temperature. Under a previous award the PI has predicted that novel superconducting and superfluid states in these systems will arise when exposed to a magnetic field or when they are rotated. A key feature of this work is the prediction of key signatures that could be observed in experiments. While hydrogen under enormous pressure exists in various places in our solar system and elsewhere in the universe, recent advances in experimental high pressure techniques suggest that the discovery of exciting new phases of matter with potential technological applications is coming within grasp. Among the possibilities are superconducting states that occur at high temperature in the light elements under high pressure. The PI will continue and extend his theoretical work to predict and explore new states of matter that may emerge in the seemingly simplist elements. Hydrogen and hydrogen dominant metallic alloys under high pressure will be a particular focus of the work. This research may have impact on other disciplines and will provide a training ground for future scientists."

Activities are organized into six to eight week modules, each of which is devoted to a specific topic and led by a Cornell graduate student. The aim of MEC is to show high school students that there is more to mathematics than the centuries old progression from algebra to calculus, and to introduce them a wide spectrum of mathematical ideas, through games, puzzles, model building, and other explorations. The Senior Seminar is a class on advanced mathematics designed for students who have taken most of the available math classes. It meets for one period during school hours three days week at the high school and introduces students to topics such as cryptography, number theory, graph theory, game theory, combinatorics, probability, and topology that they would typically not see until their junior or senior years in college.    The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of high quality materials that introduce advanced mathematical concepts to high schools in an engaging and entertaining manner. The broader impact of this proposal is to export these successful activities to a number of other communities across the country. To facilitate the development of similar activities in other locations, the faculty coordinator and some of the graduate student members will make presentations each year at the Joint Membership meetings of the MAA and AMS, and work with individuals from other universities that want to use our materials. We will create a web-based archive of activities for the MEC and of lecture notes for the Senior Seminar that can be used by students and teachers throughout the country. The availability of tested materials will make it much easier to start similar activities in other locations. The Math Explorer's Club and the Senior Seminar aim to interest more high school students in majoring in math in college, and to increase the number of young women and men who choose mathematics as a career, by increasing the flow into the pipeline."

There are already many important uses of binary nitrides. These include aluminum nitride (high thermal conductivity substrates), silicon nitride (coatings for electronics, etc.), titanium nitride (hard coatings for tools), tantalum nitride (metallic conductors and diffusion barriers in electronics, colored surfaces in jewelry, artistic displays, etc.), niobium nitride (thin film super-conducting devices), gallium nitride (blue LEDs, high speed  high power electronics). As is known from oxide chemistry, ternary and quaternary compounds offer a greater, more tunable, qualitatively different and more useful set of properties than the binaries alone. So it is reasonable to expect that ternary and quaternary nitrides will eventually provide the same, since so many useful binary nitrides are known and since structurally interesting compounds have been found, some with unusual properties. It is expected that some of these new nitrides will find utility in microelctronics or photonics. This research will also be a vehicle for the training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs in forefront techniques and methods of  Solid State Science. Interactions with industry will continue.     Technical Abstract  The preparation and existence of ternary and quaternary nitrides will be explored and their properties will be studied.  Molten metals and their alloys with lithium nitride, the only congruently melting nitride, will be used as fluxes (solvents) to prepare multinary nitrides and to examine them for potential technological uses and for novel phenomena. Initial results suggest that these fluxes and alloys of these fluxes will be highly useful in producing a large number of new compounds with novel structures and properties. This research will also be a vehicle for the training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs in the science and art of modern Solid State Chemistry. Our results have been and will be widely disseminated via the WEB, publications, seminars, professional meetings and, where appropriate, via patents."

This proposal focuses on the relationships between    the behavior of such  processes and the properties of  the underlying geometric structure.   It involves problems at the interface between  analysis, geometry and probability with a major role played by  groups and their actions.

Incomplete markets are characterized by there being an infinite number of risk neutral measures, and therefore there is not a unique price, for the typical contingent claim.   Various methods have been proposed over the last 20 years or so to give a reasonable method to choose one risk neutral measure over the others, but they have always been unsatisfying, and ultimately arbitrary.  A current popular approach is to use \"indifference pricing,\" which involves economics arguments when choosing (still arbitrarily)  risk neutral measure.  We propose instead to try to \"complete\" incomplete markets, using a modification of the idea of Heath, Jarrow and Morton, who did an analogous feat for the bond market.  The idea is to use the continuous time pricing of financial derivatives, such as options, which are traded in the markets, and which (by the theory) have to be local martingales.  Therefore we need to show that there exist risk neutral measures that simultaneously make the underlying and its traded derivatives all martingales (or local martingales, or even sigma martingales); this can get quite technical, especially in cases where the maturity of the derivative is before the trading horizon.    In the trading of equities, such as stocks, an element which has become of fundamental importance are financial derivatives, such as options.  An option allows one to transfer risk, such as (for example) portfolio exposure, or foreign currency risk, from one party to another, for a fee.  In this way, it is like fire insurance on a home, where the home owner transfers the financial risk of losing his home to an insurance company willing to bear the risk, for of course, a fee.  However unlike fire insurance or life insurance, it is quite complicated mathematically to calculate a fair price for a financial derivative.  (It is also difficult to price some types of home insurance too, at times, such as storm insurance for homes in Florida and along the Gulf Coast of the US, and insurance companies are increasingly relying on \"re-insurance,\" which can often be modeled in ways analogous to option pricing.)   The models of Black, Scholes, and Merton, for which the latter two were awarded a Nobel prize, explain how to calculate a fair price in simple situations.  We now know how to calculate fair prices in slightly more sophisticated models, known as \"complete markets\", however it is widely believed that the world is more complicated than the complete market case, and is in fact \"incomplete.\"  All of the many methods proposed to date to calculate a fair price in incomplete markets have been arbitrary, and in general not accepted either by academics, nor practitioners.  This proposal might go a long way towards solving that problem, by using the market prices of the options themselves, together with the underlying market stock prices, essentially to make an incomplete market into a complete one."

Martin, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research    Project Abstract    	This project seeks to develop and exploit three genome-enabled resources to address fundamental questions about natural resistance in tomato against the model pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. These resources are a set of 76 tomato introgression lines that are from susceptible parents but show various levels of resistance to DC3000 infection, a collection of ca. 140 functionally inactivated tomato genes that are known to alter disease susceptibility, and a set of ca. 16 DC3000 virulence effector proteins that are injected by the pathogen into host cells and can be used to identify interacting tomato proteins. The introgression lines will be analyzed with a panel of bacteria and infection-process assays, and 5 or 6 of the most promising loci will be isolated by map-based cloning. The functionally inactivated genes and genes encoding effector interactors will be placed on the tomato linkage map and on the physical map as tomato genome sequence becomes available. Comparing the sets of tomato loci identified by these multiple approaches will produce a functional profile of the defense system, reveal what aspects are most variable, and foster development of more effective and durable disease resistance based on natural defense mechanisms.  	The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) Exploit natural variation represented in tomato introgression lines to identify new host loci controlling responses to P. syringae. (2) Molecularly characterize PSR loci controlling responses to P. syringae. (3) Develop a genome-enabled model for tomato-P. syringae interactions that incorporates effector-target physical interactions and is useful for developing enhanced crop resistance to pathogens. (4) Expand functional genomics community web resources (http://pseudomonas-syringae.org) and educational outreach activities.  The project could have important outcomes with broad impact for several reasons. Crop plants are susceptible to bacteria and many other microbial pathogens, and some of the resulting diseases are virtually impossible to control. Breeding for resistance is an important control strategy and commonly exploits single, dominant resistance (R) genes. But such resistance is often defeated in the field by pathogen variants. Plants have additional \"basal\" defenses that could be better exploited but are poorly understood and difficult to work with because of the highly multifactorial nature of plant-pathogen interactions and these defenses. The quantitative trait loci underlying basal defenses can be identified through the use of introgression lines with natural variations in resistance, careful phenotypic analyses, and pathogen mutants lacking subsets of virulence factors (which can unmask phenotypes for underlying resistance loci), as proposed here. Because this research deals with genomics, agriculture, genetically engineered organisms, and disease, it can offer broad lessons for students at all levels. Therefore, this project has extensive high school outreach and undergraduate research experience components."

These materials can have efficiencies (10 Lm/W) and brightness (300 cd/m2 ), and can be fabricated using a single layer of organic material processed from solution. Contrary to mainstream organic light emitting diodes, they do not require low work function electrodes, and as a result offer potential for electroluminescent devices with reduced encapsulation requirements that can be deposited on practically any substrate. Additionally, iTMCs enable unique device fabrication paradigms, such as by soft-contact lamination, as well as the development of large-area illumination panels that do not require patterning of the organic layer. However, in order to realize this potential, advances in understanding and functionality are needed. Namely, their color gamut needs to be extended to the blue part of the spectrum, and their lifetime is practically untested. A goal will be to synthesize novel iTMCs that show blue emission and improved stability in devices. The aim is to obtain deeper understanding of the device physics of mixed conductors, and elucidate device-relevant degradation pathways for transition metal complexes.

The aims are to understand the fundamental principles that govern the co-assemblies, to simultaneously control order on multiple length scales up to the macroscopic level, and to demonstrate that combinations of dissimilar materials with control of multiscale order phenomena lead to unique, anisotropic property profiles often resulting from synergistic effects. Emerging from these considerations is a vision that, in analogy to the biological protein machinery, the monomer (block) sequence information of synthetic, non-natural macromolecules can be used to encode information about molecular level structure and functionality of co-assemblies with dissimilar materials like ceramics, and metals. This will lead to the design of entirely new classes of materials with properties that have no analogue in the natural world. The proposed research includes synthesis of all necessary organic/polymer and inorganic components, characterization of assembly structures using various scattering and electron microscopy techniques, as well as the study of specific properties including charge transport phenomena and anisotropic mechanical properties.

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing the co-assembly of dissimilar materials will have profound impact in a broad range of areas such as power generation and storage (electrocatalysis, fuel cells, and photovoltaics) or microelectronics (low-cost alternatives for lithography and magnetic storage media). A particular strength of this proposal derives from the continuation of very fruitful interactions with several individuals at Cornell and abroad (Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany) who have outstanding reputations in their fields. The proposed research program is situated at the interface between traditionally separated scientific disciplines thus promoting an interdisciplinary way of teaching, training, and learning and a unique educational experience for graduate and undergraduate students. It will also involve other components of training and development of human resources, including the participation of underrepresented groups, enhancement of the infrastructure for research and education, and industrial outreach. In particular, because of the large multiplication effect, the PI will work with local high school teachers to promote issues related to materials science and engineering.  He will establish a collaboration on hybrid materials with Norfolk State University, VA, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU) with a large participation of underrepresented minorities, (NSF PREM program)."

This supersolid state has the remarkable property that a fraction of a solid made of helium can actually pass through itself as a frictionless flow provided the temperature is low enough.  This property of the supersolid is counterintuitive and is at odds with our instinctive concept of a solid.  The supersolid is another example of a quantum mechanical state known as a superfluid and takes its place beside the previously known superfluids; superfluid 4He and superfluid 3He, superconducting electrons, and the superfluids observed in low-density trapped atomic gases.  The possible discovery of the supersolid state is a very recent finding and it is desirable to have an independent confirmation of this phenomena. The first goal of this individual investigator project is to provide such confirmation.  The next step will be to study the effects of sample geometry and crystal annealing on the properties of the supersolid.  An annealing experiment is particularly interesting, since recent theories suggest that a degree of disorder is required in the solid before the supersolid state can appear.  If this is true, then possibly the supersolid behavior might be removed by annealing process, which reduces the amount of disorder in the helium crystalline solid.  In addition to advancing the frontier of knowledge of quantum mechanical states of matter, this work will provide training for one graduate student.      ***** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT*****  The recent discovery of a potential \"supersolid\" phase in solid 4He at temperatures below 200 mK by Kim and Chan provides the realization of a prediction made more than a quarter of a century ago.  The initial suggestion for a supersolid state in crystalline 4He is based on the possibility that Bose-Einstein condensation might occur in solid helium at sufficiently low temperatures.  This individual investigator award supports a project aimed at confirming the existence of the supersolid state and investigating its nature.  In a variation on the original experiment, torsional oscillator technique in a cubic geometry will be used.  This ensures the solid is geometrically locked to the torsional oscillator and the possibility of slip at the boundary is eliminated.  Current theoretical understanding of the supersolid state suggests that the supersolid phenomena will not occur in an ideal 4He hcp crystal but some degree of disorder in the solid will be required.  Thus an important study will be examining the effects of crystal annealing on any observed supersolid signal.  This project will involve one graduate student who should profit greatly from working in a fast evolving area at the current forefront of condensed matter research."

In particular, the role played by confinement of the suspension and surface morphology of the shearing plates will be investigated. In addition to being an important class of industrial materials, such suspensions exhibit many of the hallmark features characteristic of molecular glasses including dynamic heterogeneity in the particle relaxations. As such, they can be used as a model system for investigating atomic scale glassy phenomena. Investigating glassy behavior in colloidal suspensions offers unique advantages including the ability to use ultra fast confocal microscopy to directly visualize dynamic restructuring of the particle configurations as the suspension is sheared, and the ability to use photolithography to pattern the shearing plates with arbitrary structures whose length scales are comparable to those of the particles. These capabilities will provide a mechanism for directly probing the network properties that endow colloidal glasses with their rigidity. From a broader prospective the research should lead to new phenomena that have relevance for the industrial handling and fabrication of thin films and coatings. This project makes extensive use of a variety of experimental techniques that include particle synthesis, photolithography, confocal microscopy, and the development of tracking and analysis algorithms. Therefore, graduate students will be exposed to a range of techniques and will be well prepared for future careers in multidisciplinary science. In addition semiannual New York Complex Matter Workshops will be organized. These meetings will stimulate interaction among soft matter and statistical physics researchers from Syracuse, Cornell, RIT, General Electric, Kodak, Corning and other institutions and industrial labs in the area.    Non-technical abstract:    Colloidal suspensions are made of solid particles that are about a fiftieth of a hair diameter in size and are immersed in a fluid. This small size enables the fluid molecules to hit the colloidal particles and jostle them so that they exhibit Brownian motion. From time to time the jiggling colloidal particles also bump into one another. Remarkably, it has been observed that the bumping of the colloidal particles is very similar to the way molecules bump into each other in a typical molecular gas or liquid. This allows for using colloidal suspensions as model systems in which we can observe phenomena that typically take place on the atomic scale. As the concentration of colloidal particles is increased the particles bump into one another more frequently and ultimately, at a high enough concentration the particles get stuck in a manner similar to cars getting stuck in traffic jams. This jamming is analogous to the behavior exhibited by molecules in a piece of window glass. While studying molecular motions in glasses is notoriously difficult, studying the jammed colloidal particles is comparatively easy. For example, the relatively large particle size allows for using state of the art optical microscopes to observe the collective motions of the particles deep inside the suspension. Moreover, the same photolithography technologies used for manufacturing computer chips can also be used to very accurately control the texture of the container walls. Such textures can dramatically influence the particle motions especially when the suspension is tightly confined by the container walls. This project will take advantage of these capabilities to directly investigate the effects of confinement and surface texture on the particle motions and configurations that make glasses rigid. From a broader perspective, the research should lead to the understanding of flow phenomena that have relevance for the industrial fabrication and handling of thin polymer films and coatings. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will be exposed to a range of techniques including particle synthesis, photolithography, confocal microscopy, and the development of tracking and analysis algorithms. In addition, semiannual New York Complex Matter Workshops will be organized in order to stimulate interactions relating to this project and others among researchers at Cornell, Syracuse, RIT, General Electric, Kodak, Corning and other institutions and industrial labs in the area. These workshops will also serve to introduce graduate students and post docs to the local academic and industrial research community."

McClung (Texas A&M University)      Rice (Oryza sativa) is a complex species consisting of at least five, genetically distinguishable sub-populations that inhabit diverse ecological and geographic zones throughout Asia. Evidence to date suggests that these groups are indicative of general combining ability, similar to the heterotic groups of maize.     This project is designed to test the hypothesis that sub-population structure in rice is predictive of transgressive variation and to begin to characterize the underlying genetic basis of this phenomenon. To do this, the Investigators will 1) document the genome-wide differences in allelic variation within and between the different subpopulations of O. sativa and O. rufipogon using a high resolution SNP assay, 2) undertake association mapping in rice using phenotypic evaluations for 26 core agronomic and grain quality traits, 3) systematically develop genetic materials that will allow us to explore the relationship between diversity and transgressive variation that occurs when subpopulations are crossed and 4) establish a dataset for rice that can be compared with that of the maize diversity project and ultimately with other cereal species. As part of a targeted educational outreach effort, the Investigators will conduct hands-on genomics exercises in local high schools, host high school and undergraduate students as summer interns with an emphasis on broadening participation of underrepresented groups, and will develop a multi-media video presentation exploring the culture of rice in America and in Africa to be shared with K-8th graders.    A better understanding of the genetic basis of transgressive variation in inbred crop species will have an immediate impact on the global research agenda for crop improvement. Presently, there is a great deal of interest in breeding hybrid rice as a mechanism for delivering superior varieties to farmers. But without a sound scientific understanding of the genetic mechanisms that underlie superior performance in naturally inbreeding species, some of the most promising opportunities to capture superior performance in the world's inbred crop varieties may be overlooked. The knowledge to be gained from this project will help inform thinking about how to best characterize and manage Oryza gene pools and about the relative investments that we, as a society, choose to make in developing inbred and/or hybrid varieties of our most important food staples. The genetic stocks produced as part of the project will augment the collection available through the Genetic Stocks-Oryza (GSOR) located at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center (DBNRRC) in Stuttgart, Arkansas and the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation (NCGRP) facility in Fort Collins, CO.  Information on rice diversity will be available over the project web-site, the GRIN database and will be integrated into the Gramene database (www.gramene.org)."

In addition, the plant cell wall can be thought of as a vital compartment that acts as the interface with the environment and so substantial molecular signaling occurs in and across the wall environment. In accordance with its multifunctional nature, the plant cell wall houses a large and complex protein population, or proteome, including enzymes with a broad range of catalytic functions as well as structural proteins. However, it is increasingly evident that there is still a very limited understanding of the extent, composition and dynamic properties of the cell wall proteome, also termed the 'secretome'.     This project will use an integrated approach to catalog the tomato secretome, coupling a suite of newly developed functional screens with sequencing of highly purified wall protein extracts, bioinfomatic tools and computational prediction. This infrastructure will be used to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative dynamics of the cell wall proteome during two biological processes that are intimately associated with wall biology: fruit ripening and plant defence responses. To this end, protein and mRNA expression will be studied in a standard experimental tomato genotype and contrasted with those in several non-softening tomato mutants.    This research will generate a comprehensive catalog of the plant secretome in a range of tomato tissues and importantly, provide insights into the extracellular proteins that appear to contribute to, and play a role in, signaling during fruit ripening and in response to pathogen attack. The resulting information should allow important insights into how to improve fruit quality and agricultural productivity.     A publicly accessible tomato secretome database (SecreTom) will be developed to house the project data, to provide access to all associated computational tools, and to act as a hub for plant wall proteome research.  SecreTom will be accessible through the Solanaceous Genomes Database (SGN: http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/), which will also serve as the long-term repository for the project data. In addition, an annual summer Proteomics Workshop will be held, comprising a seminar series, poster presentations, and lab-based practical training. The participation of under-represented groups at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be ensured through the support of a network of existing Cornell programs."

Building  upon this previous work in which the precession and nonlinear saturation of the r-mode  instability of neutron stars was examined, Dr. Wasserman and collaborators/students will  undertake two major computational projects. The first is a numerical study of vortex lines  and magnetic flux tubes in neutron star interiors. The work is motivated by the need to  understand the precession of pulsar PSR B1828-11 and whether its slow period  contradicts a conventional neutron superfluid/proton Type II superconductor core model.  Critical to this is the strength of drag forces between superfluid vortices and  superconducting flux tubes, which will be addressed here (if the mutual drag force  between superfluid vortices and superconducting flux tubes is too strong, long period  precession would not be possible). Second will be a study of how the nonlinear  development and saturation of the r-mode instability affects the spin evolution of new  and old accreting neutron stars. Recent work by Dr. Wasserman's group (supported by  the NSF previous award) has shown that the r-mode instability tends to saturate at lower  amplitudes than originally thought but the implications of this result on the subsequent  spin evolution of neutron stars remains unexplored.  Through this work, graduate students at Cornell will be trained in advanced and  multidisciplinary (astrophysics, gravitational physics, condensed matter) theoretical  research. Dr. Wasserman participates in the Harlow Shapley Lectureship program and  will continue to lecture regularly on forefront topics in astrophysics (including this  project) to diverse audiences, which include members of the public and high school  students in addition to faculty and students at the host colleges."

Jean-Luc Margot and Jon Giorgini will obtain and interpret high-precision radar range measurements on twelve near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) that have trajectories strongly affected by the light of the Sun, the shape of the Sun, and general relativistic effects. Asteroid orbits are influenced by the absorption and reemission of solar energy, the so-called Yarkovsky effect. These changes to the motion will be quantified with the radar measurements in order to constrain the densities, compositions, and thermal properties of NEAs. Other perturbations to NEA orbits arise as a result of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field of the oblate Sun. The ranging data to the twelve NEAs will provide a direct probe of the mass distribution in the Suns interior by measuring changes to the asteroid trajectories. Radar tests of general relativity (GR) will also be improved by quantifying the perihelion advance of NEAs that reach deep inside the gravitational well of the Sun. The GR effects can be separated from the effects of oblateness as they have a different dependence on the size, eccentricity, and inclination of the NEA orbits. Both GR and oblateness effects can be separated from the distinct signature of the Yarkovsky drift. Most of the measurements will be performed with the planetary radar on the Arecibo telescope. Analysis of the results will make use of orbital determination software at JPL. High precision measurements in this extreme dynamical regime will provide unique observational constraints and will test current models of asteroid physics, solar physics, and fundamental physics."

The ultimate goal of this project is to investigate the dynamics of the entire magmatic system of Soufriere Hills Volcano (SHV), and to enhance our generic understanding of andesitic magma dynamics.    The project was initiated in 2002 with drilling and installation of four high-sensitivity borehole (200-m deep) seismic and ground deformation (strainmeter, tiltmeter, cGPS) stations around the SHV.  This is the first and only such instrumented borehole network at any andesite volcano.  The project involves six US institutions (Arizona State U, U Arkansas, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Cornell, Duke, Penn State), Bristol and Leeds universities in the UK, and the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO).     Principal funding (ca. 2 million USD) was from NSF (Continental Dynamics, and I/F), with a contribution from UK. The installations were completed by 2004, and important instrumental data have been recovered, including those from a prodigious lava dome collapse in 2003, explosions in 2003-5, and restarted dome growth 2005 (Mattioli et al., 2004, 2005; Voight et. al., 2005). The PI's efforts to date have focused necessarily on facility and data transfer issues, but their initial research on the data promises quite important insights on the magmatic system (Voight et al. 2005).  The PIs argue that the data being collected are of unprecedented  value, and their analysis is merited on scientific grounds as well as to support the considerable investment NSF has made in developing the CALIPSO facility.

The data acquisition phase of this experiment will be carried out in 2007, with combined support of NSF (Geophysics) and the National Environmental Research Council (NERC) of the UK (see correspondence).  Support for the analysis and modeling research phase for the data acquired in SEA-CALIPSO is being provided in this award.    Specifically, this award provides support for:       (1) analyses of borehole (and ancillary surface instrument) data involving strainmeter, cGPS, tilt, seismic and other datasets, including calibrations and modeling efforts, to deduce the physical characteristics of the magma system and its perturbations (e.g. new magma influx, explosions);     (2) complete analysis, modeling and interpretation of SEA-CALIPSO data (airgun and earthquake data set recorded by ~100 PASSCAL seismic recorders for a 3-4 month period centered on the airgun survey) to generate tomographic and reflection imaging of the magmatic system;    (3) linkage of the borehole observatory analyses, tomographic imaging information, and deformation and fluid mechanic modeling;    (4) timely team workshops for coordinated planning of the research;     (5) educational outreach, and communication of research results."

The field studies will also be complemented by laboratory experiments. Genetic exchange between plants in both habitats through pollinators or seeds is important to the evolution of specialization or generalization.

This study will provide an understanding of how plants are broadly distributed across environments or limited to few habitats.

The proposed research focuses on Heliconius butterflies (a group of insects with a long history in genetic research) and has two major goals: 1) to identify genes encoding proteins involved in fertilization and egg laying and 2) to compare patterns of divergence in these genes between species with different mating systems, i.e., different levels of competition among males.  If mating system influences rates of molecular change, levels of genetic divergence among reproductive proteins should correlate with mating system.      Understanding the nature and causes of changes in proteins that mediate interactions between sperm and egg will provide important insights into the origin of diversity (how new species arise). In addition, examining unusual patterns of genetic divergence between species will also offer important insights into biological function, with implications for medicine, agriculture, and the environment. Ultimately, determining the cause of the unusual divergence found among reproductive proteins will help to inform efforts to control insect pests and treat infertility."

If similar species can interbreed when in contact, hybrids will be created. Hybridization is therefore increasing, but the ecological consequences are not well understood. Herbivorous insects often respond to hybrid plants differently than they would to the original plant species.  The response of insects to hybrids affects the abundance of insect herbivores and the success of other organisms that feed on the insects.    This research investigates the phenomenon of hybrid resistance, in which fewer herbivores are found on hybrid plants than on the original parental species. Hybrid resistance has been documented on hybrids of cattail species (Typha). The moth Limnaecia phragmitella is less abundant on hybrids but the reasons for this resistance are not known. The first objective of this project is to determine whether insect species other than the moth respond in a similar way to hybrids. The second objective is to discover why moths are less abundant on hybrids. There are two possibilities: (1) Female moths do not recognize hybrids and avoid laying eggs on them, and (2) Larval survival on hybrids is poor.     The results of this study will help predict and manage the outcomes of other hybridization events. There is also growing concern over the hybrid cattail, because it is an aggressive competitor and excludes other plants in wetlands. Herbivore resistance may contribute to the hybrids' competitiveness and lower the value of hybrid-dominated marshes as habitat for other organisms."

Unlike human or rodent malaria, avian malaria is commonly found in wild populations of its vertebrate host in North America, usually without obvious clinical signs in the birds. Bird-parasite interactions alone, however, do not satisfactorily explain some of the major findings that have emerged from recent molecular studies on avian malaria, such as the high genetic diversity and geographic localization of some parasite lineages. Coadaptation with mosquito hosts may result in the geographic localization of avian malaria parasites. We will test this hypothesis by controlled infections of different species and populations of bird-feeding mosquito species to compare their ability to transmit parasites using a parasite lineage that is restricted to the eastern U.S. If mosquito-parasite coadaptation is indeed important in this system, only eastern mosquitoes should harbor sporozoites.    These experiments will fill a gap in a rapidly growing body of knowledge concerning the ecology and evolution of malaria parasites by explicitly testing whether mosquito-parasite interactions can influence the geographic distribution of malaria parasite lineages. Results from this study could inform efforts to predict the effects of climate change on vector-borne disease distribution, and could support an ecological redefinition of malaria as a mosquito parasite that relies on vertebrates for dispersal."

Whereas previous data reveal that there was major change in climate over that time interval, the data were insufficient to resolve the magnitude and timing of the regional scale first-order pattern of change. Recently, it was proposed that the dramatic rise of the Central Andes  was the consequence of, rather than the cause for, the aridification of the western margin of South America. That hypothesis invokes a fundamental geodynamic relationship between climate and tectonics, coupled through the affect of sediment fill of the trench on the mechanical properties of the plate interface. But competing models that more comprehensively incorporate the dynamics of the plate boundary-Andes system conclude that climate-related phenomena, while intriguing, are not of first-order importance. This project develops a Miocene paleoclimate history that serves as a rigorous test of these competing hypotheses.     Paleosols are used in this project as a paleoclimate proxy. Used to estimate paleo-precipitation are a variety of soil morphological and geochemical characteristics, including the chemical composition of saline soil cements (nitrate, sulfate, carbonate), chemical-weathering ratios of argillic horizons, and isotopic values of soil carbonate, all features that are highly correlated with precipitation between 0 and 400 millimeters/year in Chile today. This project builds from a pilot project in the center of the Atacama Desert to a regional-scale description of when precipitation change occurred, which allows one to discern whether the change was simultaneous or diachronous along the western margin of the Central Andes, whether it preceded or followed surface uplift,  and whether climate fluctuations occurred multiple times during the Miocene. In addition to testing the geodynamic models, the new knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of paleoclimate change allow comparison of the western Central Andes climate history to that of the eastern margin of the Central Andes, to test whether the aridification was caused by surface uplift or by global climate change.    Does regional-scale climate change cause mountain belts to rise in elevation, or does the rise of mountain belts cause the climate of a continent to change? Resolution of this \"chicken-and-egg\" question motivates this study of the history of climate and mountain growth in the Atacama Desert of the Andes Mountains of northern Chile. Positive feedback relations between climate and construction of mountain ranges and entire mountain chains are current topics of research in geological sciences. The Atacama Desert affords an unparalleled opportunity to examine the feedback processes at the very dry end of Earth's climate spectrum. The database for ancient precipitation that will be extracted from ancient soil properties is also valuable in documentation of the long-term history of interior South America, inclusive of whether the Amazon basin, with its high degree of biodiversity, evolved in response to global climate change or to climate change induced by uplift of the Andes Mountains. The uncertainties are comparable to those in the debate about whether today's climate changes are caused by natural phenomena or anthropogenic activity. Through participation of U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, the project trains next-generation geologists to study interrelations between soils, vegetation, climate, and topography. Through participation of a Chilean professor and graduate student, the project provides models of and practice in respectful international collaboration for the students, and more efficiently fulfill the project objectives.

Challenges in managing a species across its entire geographic range are especially great, as scaling up insights from small local studies to management over an entire continent may be impossible. Further, initial management decisions may need to be made under very short time deadlines, and in the absence of much prior knowledge about a species. Often, the necessary data to inform timely management decisions for little-known species already exist; however, what is limiting is ready access to the data and especially to the analytical tools needed to explore these data.  This project joins the strengths of data mining and machine learning tools with statistical methods, to create a suite of powerful new predictive and inferential tools in a new analytical framework for data mining and machine learning that will permit extracting more relevant information from the available data and by incorporating prior information into a hybrid hierarchical/data mining model.  The result will be new data-mining techniques that allow statistical inferences about large numbers of environmental variables and their potential interactions. This will greatly enhance the ability to model the landscape-level response of bird populations to multiple risk factors and to develop prescriptions for reversing population declines through land management.  This project will expose new data resources and advances in computational analysis, data visualizations, and manipulations to vast new audiences: from biologists, conservation agencies, and land-use planners to school classrooms and tens of thousands of citizens who participate in environmental monitoring, including the millions of people across the country who watch birds.

To begin  with the problem of a posteriori error estimation that can accurately predict the error on a single element using a class of averaging operators will be considered.  These methods do not seem to work well for problems on polygonal domains for which the pollution error dominates.  Accurate local estimators and indicators will be sought to correct this not only for quasi-uniform meshes but also for refined grids.  In order to carry out the above programs, it is necessary to develop fundamental technical tools such a sharp a priori estimates, both local and global, both for smooth and nonsmooth problems where both quasi-uniform and highly refined grids are present.  These problems are an integral part of this proposal.   The socalled superapproximation property of many finite elements has proved to be a powerful tool in the analysis of the finite element method.  Applications will be sought for a new form of this property that does away with mesh restrictions for some problems.    There are a very large number of important physical problems that arise in science and industry.  For many of these problems it is cost effective to make a mathematical model and to solve the problem on a computer.  For example consider the problem of designing an aircraft (or an automobile) so that is as fuel efficient and fast as possible.  Suppose that in order to achieve this we wish to minimize the drag and still give the aircraft enough lift to do its job. Instead of making a physical model that may be difficult and costly to change in order to arrive at an optimal design, many aircraft companies now almost completely design airplanes inside and out on computers.  The mathematical equations that must be solved are complicated but at the heart of many solution methods there is required the solution of a socalled elliptic differential equation.  This type of equation arises in a very large number of applications.  This project is concerned with obtaining more cost effective and efficient solutions of elliptic problems in order to obtain  more accurate and efficient numerical schemes.  In order to do so, we have to confront some fundamental mathematical problems which will be done in this proposal."

In one part of the research, specific puzzles of bonding across chemistry will be considered.  The proposal asks for what set of atoms could one build networks containing both square planar and tetrahedral element geometries, and whether it is possible to have an iodine in a benzene ring.  Another question is to what extent does an ionic (not molecular) solid maintain a memory of the structural preferences of its component building blocks.  A central effort addresses the role of chemistry in the burgeoning field of structure under high pressure and proposes to design a series of studies to gain insight into what determines structure under, say, five-fold volume compression.  One focus is hydrogen-rich materials, exploring a suggestion that easier metallization and superconductivity under pressure might be achieved if hydrogen is \"chemically precompressed,\" i.e tied up in a molecular precursor.      Building bridges between theory and experiment, between different subdisciplines of chemistry, and between chemistry and physics in the field of high pressure studies is proposed to have a broad impact in science in areas such as hydrogen storage.  The work would also build bridges to society at large, to young scientists, and to those in the arts and humanities through a commitment to writing and speaking of science for/to a general audience, and to communicating with people in the arts."

This work seeks to determine the relative contributions of enhanced growth and regrowth to carbon accumulation in the forests of the Northeast. The question will be tackled from three directions: by analyzing the large but previously inaccessible data sets of the US Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); by comparison of these FIA data to model simulations of a forest carbon model (to test the hypothesis of enhanced growth); and by reanalyzing historical patterns of land use, management and disturbance (to test the regrowth hypothesis).

Unlike insects such as grasshoppers, where all individuals of a given species can and do eat a wide range of food plants, the apple maggot and similar insects form local populations (termed \"host races\") that feed within the fruits of only one or a few plant species. To understand how they do this, fly populations attacking different species of hawthorns in the southern United States will be tested to determine: 1) if they preferentially orient toward the chemical odor of the fruit of the hawthorn species they infest--this is how the flies find their host plants in nature to mate on and lay eggs into fruit, 2) if the timing of the life cycle of the flies is adapted to differences in when the various hawthorn trees fruit--some southern hawthorns fruit very early in the season (May) and some late (October-November), and 3) the degree to which any observed differences in odor response and life cycle are genetically based.     The broader impacts of the research are multi-faceted, having both important applied and basic benefits. Insects frequently shift their feeding to new crops. The apple maggot fly is a classic example, having shifted in the last 100 years from native hawthorns of little commercial interest to introduced apples of great economic value. Information about how this process occurs, which will be provided by research on southern hawthorn flies, is needed for better management of pests. For example, Rhagoletis pomonella flies from apple are repelled by the odor of red hawthorn, and vice versa, leading to the possibility that even better natural repellent odors might be found among the various southern hawthorn species. The project is also of basic scientific interest because shifts onto novel plants may serve as a trigger for speciation for many host specific insects. Finally, the project will provide important additional societal benefits by helping integrate science training and education across the local, community, and university levels"

The intellectual core of this work is be a formal semantic account of distributed computation based on event structures.  This formalism is considerably more abstract than the standard state sequence or temporal logic semantics.  The aim of the research is to move event structures from pure theory toward support for more effective design, programming, and verification of real systems.  Since the 80's, an event style theory has held considerable unrealized promise.

Instead of increasing clock frequency, which increases power dissipation, CPU chip manufacturers are using advances in semiconductor technology to increase the number of cores on a processor chip. This shifts the burden of improving program performance from chip manufacturers to software developers. Many industry experts believe that programming multicore processors is now the most important challenge facing the software industry.    Compiler technology for parallel architectures is not effective for irregular applications that use linked data structures such as trees and graphs. These data structures are ubiquitous in important application areas like graphics, mesh generation and linear system solvers.    This project develops a new approach for parallelizing and optimizing irregular programs for multicore processors. The key insight is that optimistic parallelization is essential for irregular programs. Transactional memory is an attractive way to implement optimistic parallelization; this project will design, implement and evaluate new transactional models that exploit properties of high-level program abstractions rather than simply tracking low-level reads and writes.    Results will be disseminated through publications and by making the software transactional memory system available for downloading.

These econometric models are called partially identified models. The focus of the economic analysis then becomes the set of admissible values for the parameter vector of interest. However, while identification in these models focuses on sets and not on single points, estimation and inference have so far relied on techniques designed for point identified models. This is because econometricians have lacked tractable tools to estimate and test models with set identified parameters. Unfortunately, as economists attempt to analyze increasingly complex social phenomena, partially identified set models are being encountered.  This research will provide a methodology to extend the conceptual shift from single valued to set valued objects to estimation and hypothesis testing. The methodology the PIs propose is based on mathematical tools that were originally introduced by economic theorists, and are intensely researched in the recent mathematical and statistical literature, although not used in the econometrics literature.         The results of this research should allow economists to conduct estimation and testing for partially identified models in a way that is completely analogous to how estimation and testing are conducted for point identified models. This is a huge contribution to economic science.  Partially identified models are ubiquitous in the recent theoretical and empirical economics. Examples include theoretical studies of incomplete models for English auctions, empirical studies of oligopoly entry models with multiple equilibria, and of the changes in the distribution of male and female wages accounting for employment composition. The results of this research will provide a methodological  framework for estimating and testing these models as well as provide software to apply this ethodology to conduct estimation and inference when full identification is not available. The results of this research will allow researchers (both theoretical and empirical) to investigate increasingly complex phenomena that had hitherto only been analyzed at the theoretical level.  Policies based on such studies will be more realistic."

This technique is a key tool for development of advanced magnetic/electronic materials: the impact on electron wavefunctions of impurity/dopant atoms, the crystal lattice, electron-electron interactions and external electric/magnetic fields, can all be determined directly at the atomic scale.  But many of the most important and revealing phenomena in complex electronic/magnetic materials occur at very high magnetic fields. At Cornell University, we propose to develop the world's first very high magnetic field SI-STM facility - operating with atomic resolution in fields between 0 and 20 Tesla, with tip/sample temperature between 0.25K and 100K. It will then, for the first time, become possible to address crucial scientific challenges in atomic-scale electronic structure at high magnetic fields. These include, for example, quantum hall effects in graphene, field-induced superconductor-insulator transitions in cuprates, colossal magneto-resistance in manganites, possible electronic supersolid phases in cuprates, and field-induced quantum phase transitions in other transition metal oxides.  This unprecedented system will operate as a user facility at Cornell, allowing wide access for nanoscale studies of complex electronic/magnetic materials in very high magnetic fields. Furthermore, as recommended by the National Academy, the National High Magnetic Field Lab (NHMF) in Tallahassee needs to achieve such capabilities.

Stroock,  Cornell University    MRI:  Development of a 4-dimensional micro/nano-scale defocused particle tracking (DPT) imaging technique and its applications in nanobiotechnology       This Major Research Instrumentation grant is to develop an imaging technology for tracking multiple micro/nano scale particles with sub-micrometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution via a quantitative use of defocused images taken with an epifluorescence microscope. This new technology is referred to as a 4-dimensional micro/nano defocused particle tracking (4D DPT) technique. The main contribution of the 4D DPT technique to the current state-of-art technology is its capability to probe Lagrangian information of particles at micro and nano scales, which is essential for the development of micro/nano fluidic devices, bioMEMS device, as well as the understanding of inter and intra cellular dynamics in biology.  The 4D micro/nano DPT technique represents an important innovation in flow visualization at micro/nano meter scales. The intellectual merit of the proposed project resides in its ability to unravel dynamic behavior both in micro/nano fluidic and biofluidic systems at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. When coupled with recent advances in biophotonics, particularly genetically encoded fluorescent reagents, 4D micro/nano DPT technique will enable an ability to visualize single molecular events in living cells. Such capability will, in turn, play a unique role in the recent quest of correlating gene network dynamics with cell's phenotype in biology. In terms of broader impact, the 4D DPT will serve as a shared facility within the Cornell Nanobiotechnology Center (NBTC - NSF STC), it will provide a natural setting for collaboration among its users across many research disciplines. As such, it will impact a broad scientific community. In addition, the 4D DPT technology will be made available to industry through the NBTC's industrial partnership program, and through PIs' collaboration with local industries. The 4D imaging system provides us with a unique opportunity to reach out to the public due to the visual nature of the experimental results.  The results of the 4D DPT imaging system will be made into an exhibition entitled `Brownian motion' at the Ithaca Science Center, where visitors can see movie clips of dilute nano and micro particles, as well as swimming bacteria.  The PIs will develop an interactive website both for the K-12 community and the research community.  For the greater research community, the PIs will establish and maintain an up-to-date website of research results and imaging software."

The jump of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum from domestic poultry to House Finches is one such case that is amenable to facilitating the development of general models of disease dynamics. This project will explore the effects on disease dynamics of multiple hosts that differ in competence and transmissions routes that differ in disease expression. By combining experimental work, studies of free-living bird communities, and mathematical models, it is possible to determine under what conditions epidemics will arise, and hence how they can be halted.     A variety of broader impacts will result. Thousands of members of the general public participate in monitoring the disease among wild birds through a citizen science program. Because the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology routinely communicates research results and their relevance to the general public through a newsletter that reaches over 40,000 households, members of the public are educated about the process and products of this research.

First, it provides a theoretical framework for explaining the relationship between networks and the spread of rumor. Second, it provides an empirical investigation of the diffusion of rumor through networks, including a comparison with the transmission of valid information. Finally, this project offers an empirical test of hypotheses generated by leading theoretical research on network models of social contagion.  The project applies network models of cascades and social contagion to analyzing the spread of rumor. These models differentiate between simple and complex contagions, and predict that simple contagions will spread regardless of network topology while complex contagions will spread less effectively on small-world and scale-free networks than on cohesive graphs. Valid information, which an individual is likely to pass along even after hearing it from one source, is an example of a simple contagion, while rumor, which an individual will be reluctant to pass along without some corroboration, is an example of a complex contagion.    The project will use Netscan, a vast database of messages collected from Usenet, an Internet-based discussion tool, to empirically examine the spread of rumor and network models of social contagion. By providing both a detailed, systematic description of the spread of rumor and direct empirical tests of the hypotheses generated by the theoretical models, this study will advance our understanding of social contagion in general, and rumor transmission in particular.    Broader Impact:  The results of this study will have implications on research in areas as diverse as computer science and organizational communication. Computer security experts, corporate executives, and political leaders all contend with separating rumor from verified information, and would welcome a systematic  comparison of their diffusion processes. This research will offer opportunities for undergraduates and members of underrepresented minorities to get involved in academic research, providing cross-disciplinary research experience for students of sociology and information science."

School children face them when they decide to do their homework instead of watching TV, and adults face them when they decide to save for their retirement rather than enjoy an extensive vacation.  What makes it possible to resist temptation some times, but not others?  Is it basic brain function and anatomy, some of which may be based on genetic variations? The goal of this research is to understand the cognitive and neural bases of self-control, in particular the ability to override impulsive responding and to delay immediate gratification in the service a delayed, but more desirable, future consequence.  The investigators will examine this process in detail at three levels.  First, at the level of mental processes, the researchers will examine the extent to which self-control has to do with people's ability (1) to block the entry of unwanted information (e.g., by paying attention to something else), or (2) to suppress unwanted thoughts (e.g., by thinking about something else), or (3) to stop themselves from acting (e.g., by keeping one's hand from moving). Second, self-control processes will be analyzed at the level of brain functioning and anatomy.  Past research has identified areas of the brain that become particularly activated when people engage in these processes, as well as connections between areas of the brain that seem to play a key role. These functional and anatomical features will be related to effective self-control strategies, such as shutting out information, suppressing thoughts, and inhibiting behavior. Finally, self-control processes will be examined at the level of genetics. Recent research has found that variations in some genes may be related to people's ability to self-control. Modern technology has made it possible to examine which variation of these genes people have using a simple, non-invasive and cost-effective method, when the target DNA sequences are known. Using such methods, the researchers will determine if these known gene variations are also related to the three mental processes, as well as the brain functioning and anatomy associated with them.     The participants will come from a longitudinal study, which began with a sample of 306 participants when they were enrolled in preschool in the early 1970s. The ability to pursue long-term goals in the face of immediate temptation was assessed once every decade since the original testing. Participants have now reached their late 30s and early 40s, and information about their life-outcomes, such as their occupational, marital, and physical health, and mental health status are becoming available. In the proposed project, we will study two groups of people in this longitudinal study. Individuals in one group have displayed high levels of self-control consistently over four decades, and those in the other group have consistently displayed self-control abilities well below the average of the cohort.  By comparing these groups, we hope to learn the extent to which basic mental processes, brain functions and anatomy, and genetic variations are related to self-control. What we learn from this study may lead to a more precise understanding of the mechanisms that enable self-control, and may provide a foundation for future intervention to facilitate people's efforts to exert self-control."

At the same time, information and communication technologies have pervaded almost all aspects of human communication, from everyday technologies that support interpersonal interactions, such as email and instant messaging, to more sophisticated systems that support organization-level interactions. With this NSF award the research team will draw on communication, psychology, natural language processing and computational linguistics to examine how humans adapt their deceptive practices to new communication and information environments. The primary research questions are: 1) how do computer-mediated environments affect the production and practices of deception? 2) how is our ability to detect deception affected by computer-mediated environments? and 3) can advanced computational and natural language processing techniques be used to analyze and identify deceptive and truthful messages? In addition to behavioral studies of deception production and detection, the project will develop the Deceptive Message Corpus, a large-scale, shared database of several hundred thousand messages coded for deceptiveness that will be made available to the research community to facilitate research on digital deception. By examining deception in mediated environments and building computer-based tools for the detection of deceptive messages, the proposed research will lead to new approaches that will improve our ability to detect digital forms of deception."

This research has shown that physical circulation patterns are responsive to phase changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and that physical and biological responses to NAO forcing in the Scotian Shelf (SS), Gulf of Maine (GOM) and Georges Bank (GB) ecosystems exhibit some degree of predictability. This project will assess the role of remote upstream forcing from the Labrador Sea on ecosystem processes throughout the Northwest Atlantic. Previous studies provided evidence for the hypothesis that remote forcing from the Labrador Sea, as mediated by the Coupled Slope Water System (CSWS), impacts ecosystem processes in the SS/GOM/GB region. This result will expand the scope of this earlier research to examine the following hypotheses: (1). Remote forcing of ecosystem processes in the SS/GOM/GB region is mediated by the CSWS and by enhanced transport of lower salinity shelf waters derived from upstream sources, including the Labrador Sea.(2) Remote forcing from the Labrador Sea impacts ecosystem processes  in the SS/GOM/GB region and in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). These hypotheses will be explored via retrospective analyses of climate, remote-sensing, physical oceanographic, biological oceanographic, and fisheries time-series data. A working group composed of climate scientists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists from the region will work with the research team to steer the research agenda and assist in the interpretation of results. Assessing the regional impacts of climate variability and change is one of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century. This project aims to develop a predictive understanding of climate impacts on marine ecosystems in the Northwest Atlantic thus enabling operational input to the managers of living marine resources. Education is integrated into research in this study by training graduate students."

COWEN  INSTITUTION:			CORNELL UNIVERSITY    THE EFFECT OF SUBMERGED AND EMERGENT, HIGHLY FLEXIBLE AND RIGID MACROPHYTE CANOPY PATCHES ON FLOW AND MASS TRANSPORT      This grant provides funding to perform a series of carefully controlled experimental studies on the effects of aquatic macrophyte canopy patches on low-speed flows. The literature on the effects of terrestrial and aquatic vegetation on flow is becoming quite rich but there is a significant gap in the aquatic plant literature on the effects of heterogeneous canopies in low-speed flows and for the effects of highly flexible macrophtyes in general.  The investigators will collect a canonical experimental data set documenting the effects of highly flexible macrophyte canopies and heterogenous macrophyte patches on low-speed flow and mass transport. A secondary goal is to extend and investigate the ability of existing turbulence closure schemes to capture these effects. The experiments will be conducted using two species of live macrophytes. The macrophytes will be placed in patches of increasing complexity in the all glass test section of a wide open-channel flume. State of the art quantitative imaging techniques will be used to measure the turbulent velocity characteristics, including the directly calculated turbulent dissipation, as well as the transport and dispersion of fluorescent tracers.  Proposed modifications to turbulence closure models will be the starting point for investigating the ability of models to capture the turbulent kinetic energy budget. Competing numerical models of canopy flow that perform equally well in uniform aquatic canopies will be tested against this novel heterogeneous data set.  The collected data set will fill critical gaps in our understanding of aquatic plant-flow interaction. It is important to work with live plants, as field biologists monitor macrophyte communities using metrics that do not lend themselves to scaling with simulated plant model results. The tested turbulence closure models will allow the development of computational tools capable of forecasting transport in natural environments dominated by both highly flexible and heterogeneous plant canopy patches - environments such as lakes of all scales, salt marshes, estuaries and coastal embayments and terrestrial flows as well. The project will lead to an interdisciplinary Ph.D. for a talented female student who will work with the PI to develop laboratory experiences for an introductory fluid mechanics course and to host weeklong projects for a program targeting high-school women interested in science and engineering."

Recognizing the absence of a correct taxonomy to use cooperative links at the network and multiple access layer, the objective of this collaborative project is to investigate theoretically and experimentally the interplay between a cooperative decentralized physical layer and the wireless network architecture as a whole. More specifically, the project will develop viable link abstractions, multiple access protocols, end-to-end network transport models, appropriate algorithms to support the introduction in wireless mobile networks of two technologies that are rapidly advancing: 1) cooperative transmission, that consists of multiple network nodes operating as a decentralized multi-antenna modem and, 2) distributed source coding, that allows the decentralized compression of correlated observations and, thus, is relevant to the design of a decentralized receiver.  The project will also use the GNU software radio platform to test cooperative links and assess their feasibility and degradation when facing real limitations of transceiver synchronization, carrier offset, clock jitter and computation delays.   Algorithms and theoretical results will be disseminated through the standard tools of research publications. Experimental results will be also documented online where the software will be shared to serve as an educational tool as well as to foster new technological advances in mesh networks.

At best, this imposes a tremendous cost on industry.  Worse, it compromises critical infrastructure that increasingly relies on the Internet, such as power and emergency services.  The difficulty of network management derives from the fact that the Internet was invented without a network management architecture.  Rather, there are a plethora of after-the-fact management tools and objects.    This project is a ground-up redesign of network management based on three core concepts.  First is a low-level, self-configuring communication channel that allows software network managers to discover devices and other managers.  This channel allows the management system to function even when higher level protocols do not. Second is an abstract interface that allows network modules to represent themselves in simple ways.  This abstraction allows management systems to understand the network without understanding the details of protocol operation.  Third is a declarative configuration language that allows human managers to specify network operation in goal-oriented terms.  This language allows managers to focus on what the network is supposed to accomplish, instead of how.    This research will reduce the manpower and expertise needed to manage networks, increase their reliability, and ultimately lead towards largely self-managing networks.    This research will be tested and deployed in Emulab, a large network testbed used by thousands of researchers.  Methods hardened in Emulab can serve as the basis for management of the GENI infrastructure, where the ideas can be further tested and refined.  GENI in turn will serve as a proof-of-concept for industry adoption."

The station enables the research of scientists and students with interests ranging from limnology to bio-geochemistry to fishery ecology to policy. Demand for use of CBFS facilities, including housing accommodations, has increased over the last decade, with peak usage between 2003 and 2005.  This increased demand has occurred in association with completion of the station's new aquatic experimental research facility. The newly remodeled dormitory would 1) replace a seasonal housing unit converted to student housing in 1956, 2) result in a net gain in both seasonal and year-round housing capacity, 3) provide handicapped accessible accommodations, and 4) meet both current and anticipated future housing needs of the station. The CBFS provides a training ground for graduate students in aquatic ecology, fisheries, and limnology, promotes learning through discovery and hands-on experiences for undergraduate and high school students, and disseminates scientific findings to enhance public awareness and understanding of the environment. Long-term studies of ecological ecosystems, such as those conducted by CBFS faculty and students are vital to improving our understanding of the dynamics of ecological disruptions and of the mechanisms that influence these dynamics, including the impacts of human activities and of natural variability."

To address this  problem, this project develops a distributed, federated platform  for secure, distributed computation over consistent, durable objects.  The platform is a universal system for managing structured  information and securely computing on it, allowing allow very large  numbers of objects to be linked together on behalf of many mutually  distrusting users, while giving users control over where objects are  stored. This enables organizations to cooperate in a fine-grained,  low-cost way, with benefits for many activities including education,  medicine, business-to-business transactions, corporate and military  information systems, and large-scale cooperative information resources.    The project goes beyond previous distributed systems platforms in  several ways. It provides integrated support for both distributed  storage and distributed computation, whereas previous platforms have  focused on one or the other.  It supports cooperative sharing of  information and computation even when the cooperating entities do  not fully trust each other.  And it aims to automatically enforce a  larger class of desirable system properties: not just security or  availability narrowly defined, but also properties such as consistency,  confidentiality, integrity, efficiency, and durability.  Replication,  encryption, and distributed commit protocols make it possible to  automatically ensure the consistency, integrity, and availability  of persistent information.

An example is census data, an invaluable source of socioeconomic data. Simple approaches for limiting disclosure, such as removing identifying attributes like social security number and name, are not sufficient because combinations of other information in the data can help identify individuals in the data, especially when the data can be linked to external databases. It is this linkage, and in general, the property of data that it is often explicitly linked to other data, that is the focus of this project.     In linked data, data records are linked through relationships between records. Examples include data about students and the classes they took where the links are the association between a student and the classes she took; data about network packets and the routers that forwarded these packets, where the links are the association of packets to routers; or data about people and their social network, where the links are the social relationships between people. It is the explicit representation of these links in the data that violates some of the key assumptions of prior work. This research spans the whole spectrum from motivating applications of linked data, to novel privacy models and practical anonymization algorithms, to new techniques for attacking and analyzing anonymized data."

The objective is to develop more efficient and effective modes of reasoning in particular instances by exploiting the special mathematical structure of the application.  One would like to provide natural logical rules that match the problem at hand, thereby streamlining the reasoning process and making it more amenable to automation.  Within this general context, five specific research projects are proposed, involving (1) Kleene algebra and Kleene algebra with tests; (2) binary relation, trace, and language models; (3) stochastic processes, probabilistic programs, and dynamical systems; (4) basic category theory; and (5) monads and monad composition.  In each of these projects, new modes of reasoning or logical principles can be developed that take advantage of the particular mathematics of the problem to enhance the reasoning process. In some cases, automated tools based on these principles can be developed. For example, in (3), existing techniques for stochastic processes typically require heavy use of mathematical analysis. However, for certain arguments, one can give algebraic or logical proof principles that encapsulate the necessary analysis and allow reasoning to take place  at a more abstract algebraic level. In (4), a new deductive system for arguments in basic category theory is proposed that will allow much of the process to be automated. Finally, in (5), one can give a new high-level approach to reasoning about monads and other categorical structures based on string rewriting.  2 Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity  The new intellectual tools proposed here can help shortcut complicated arguments and significantly increase reliability of complex systems. As the complexity of systems that we deal with increases from day to day, such tools are sorely needed. For example, monads have recently become very popular in functional and logic programming. They have been shown to provide a means to combine modules or extend functionality of programming languages or data structures with new features such as continuations, state, and concurrency. Monad composition proofs are notoriously involved, however. With the new techniques proposed  in (5), researchers in those areas will find it easier to reason about monads and monad composition.  The project will fully integrate research and education and provide significant opportunities  for both undergraduate and graduate students for involvement in research and independent  study.  The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through the KATML system and software to be developed for basic category-theoretic reasoning. Both of these systems will promote intellectual rigor and provide students with a tool for understanding formal systems through experimentation. The KAT-ML system has already been used successfully in the undergraduate course on automata and computability at Cornell for working with regular expressions, and has proved to be quite popular."

Because signals propagate in shared media, the very acts of transmission reveal crucial aspects of networking. More challenging for wireless sensor networks is that sensors are not physically secure; An adversary can then gain full control of a fraction of the sensors and program them to attack from within.    This research investigates the theory and practical techniques of secure wireless and sensor networking. Statistical signal processing and machine learning techniques are developed to extract networking information.  Countermeasures against traffic analysis are developed using network coding and randomized mixing techniques. Tradeoffs between stable throughput and secrecy (with delay constraints) are characterized theoretically.      For sensor networks performing signal processing tasks, optimal attacking strategies using Byzantine sensors are investigated. Countermeasures are developed using robust and universal detection and estimation techniques.  Collaborative sensor networking strategies are also investigated to counter Byzantine attacks."

Shmoys      Intellectual Merit - For most applications in which optimization algorithms  are employed in industry, the input data is actually not known. This might be  because the data is based on measurements, which are estimates due to noise, or because only a forecast of future data is available. Stochastic  optimization models incorporate this uncertainty as part of the input, and are  harder to solve than their deterministic counterparts. This research  investigates algorithms that compute provably near-optimal solutions for   stochastic optimization problems; in contrast, traditional approaches mostly  show convergence results without guarantees to efficiently produce  near-optimal solutions.  Broader Impact - Finding good approaches to  gain new efficiencies in logistical planning is important for the overall US  economy.  This research develops new algorithmic techniques to do this. By studying simplified models, this research devises algorithmic paradigms that  can then be applied in more concrete applications, thereby providing industry   with better solutions.  Furthermore, it is important that the US workforce has  sufficient expertise to meet the technological challenges of the coming  century, and by integrating this research with the training of both graduate  and undergraduate students, this work helps to meet this need in maintaining  the economic competitiveness of the US.    This research addresses a number of specific discrete stochastic optimization  problems, focusing primarily on problems from logistics: routing, scheduling,  inventory management and network design. This research focuses on a \"black box\"  that specifies the probabilistic input by means of polynomial independent   samples from the underlying distribution;  this is important when one has  access to historical data.  This work studies the stochastic TSP, max cut, and  single-machine scheduling problems; 2-stage with recourse models of the  survivable network design and maximum job selection problems, and multistage   stochastic models from inventory control, options pricing, and AdWords bidding.  This research also studies the deterministic asymmetric TSP, bin-packing, and  capacitated facility-location problems."

Previous studies in the Andean plateau have estimated paleoelevations based on paleobotanical data, the delta oxygen-18 of sedimentary carbonates, and the new clumped isotope method. However, these studies estimate elevation by assuming a base level climate similar to today, with today's relationships among altitude, mean annual surface temperature, and the delta oxygen-18 of meteoric waters. This assumption is a source of uncertainty unless the temperature or starting composition of the vapor source can be constrained. Part of this study will establish a low elevation climate record from the Subandes against which the paleoelevation records from the Altiplano can be compared. By this approach, a more accurate record of elevation will be extracted by calibrating against secular variations in climate observed in the Subandes. Importantly, this new approach will allow study of the entire plateau, including its arid southern half, which has resisted attempts to determine paleoelevation based on delta oxygen-18 of surface carbonates alone.    With a better resolution of the spatial and temporal variation in the magnitude of surface uplift of the Andes, the broader significance of this study will be an understanding of processes that lead to surface uplift of mountain belts, including thickening of crustal and mantle lithosphere and removal of dense, thickened lower lithosphere. Recent studies of the elevation history of the northern Altiplano suggest that rapid surface uplift ( approximately 3 km in 3 million years) occurred in the late Miocene, postdating major crustal thickening by upper crustal folding and faulting. There is evidence of similar-age surface uplift across the width of the Andes for over greater 5 degrees of latitude, implicating the removal of mantle lithosphere as an important mechanism for surface uplift. However, independent data have only predicted mantle lithosphere removal in the southern Altiplano and Puna. Documentation of the timing and magnitude of surface uplift along strike in the Andes will shed light on the combined roles of these processes as well their regional extent.    Additional broader impacts of this work are to examine the effects of mountain building on regional climate. This project will examine the spatial variations in climate from middle Miocene to recent over different latitudes in the Altiplano, as well as from low to high elevation along the eastern flank of the Andes, to evaluate the potential influence of surface uplift on local climate. A pilot study of the tooth enamel of late Miocene to modern large, water-dependent grazers shows that these animals were ingesting surface water similar in composition to modern rainfall. These data will be extended back to the middle Miocene to evaluate whether the Late Miocene to modern pattern of rainfall resulted from regional surface uplift. In addition, temporal changes in low elevation and high elevation precipitation amount will be evaluated to test the hypothesis that late Miocene surface uplift of the Altiplano forced climate change that was manifested by an increase in low elevation rainfall amount and a simultaneous decrease in high elevation rainfall amount. This study will provide a model for a new and widely applicable approach to reconstructing past climates and paleoelevation through the clumped carbon-12 and oxygen-18 paleothermometry method to reconstruct past temperatures and conventional stable isotope studies to reconstruct patterns of precipitation."

This study is motivated by these questions: Why do oceanic volcanoes evolve over time? Why does rejuvenescent volcanism occur after millions of years of inactivity? What accounts for the changes in composition with time? How universal is the well-known Hawaiian pattern of volcanic evolution? Hawaiian volcanoes evolve through a well-documented series of stages. The main volcanic edifice is constructed rapidly during the shield stage (Kilauea for example). Subsequently, activity wanes and there are only occasional eruptions of alkalic lavas (Hualalai and Mauna Kea for example). Then there is a hiatus of activity of anywhere from a few hundred thousand to a few million years. This is sometimes followed by a post-erosional or rejuvenescent phase in which small volumes of very alkali lava erupt explosively. The Honolulu volcanics, including Diamondhead, are a good example of this stage.    Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean, represents one of the most striking examples of rejuvenescent volcanism outside Hawaii. Like Hawaii, Mauritius is thought to result from a mantle plume (the Reunion mantle plume). Earlier studies have identified three phases of volcanism on Mauritius: the Older Series (7.8 to 5.4 million years), the Intermediate Series (3.5. to 1.9 million years), and the Younger Series (1.0 to 0.17 million years). Older Series volcanism constructed the main volcanic shield on Mauritius and seems clearly analogous to the Hawaiian shield-building stage. The Intermediate Series seems analogous to the Hawaiian post-erosional phase. The Younger Series may simply represent an extension of the Intermediate Series phase; if not, it has no clear analog in Hawaiian volcanic evolution. Thus, volcanism on Mauritius provide an opportunity to compare and contrast with Hawaiian volcanism and to develop a general model for oceanic island volcanic evolution. Mauritius is also an opportune target for study because the Water Resources Unit of the Government of Mauritius has a large collection of drill cores (drilling was originally undertaken in the search for water resources). These cores often penetrate the veneer of post-erosional lavas that cover most of the island and sample fresh, primitive lavas erupted during the shield-building stage. The deeper cores also provide an opportunity for stratigraphically controlled sampling.    Samples will be studied petrographically and analyzed for major elements, trace elements, and Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotope ratios. This will produce a comprehensive geochemical data set for Mauritius. Twenty-five key samples will be dated by Ar-Ar at Oregon State University. In collaboration with colleagues at Cornell, these observational results will compared with computer simulations of melting of a lithologically heterogeneous mantle plume consisting of eclogitic veins in a peridotitic matrix. The finite element model of this phenomenon that is being developed is an attempt to simulate the evolution of magma composition through time. The team will participate in the modeling project by incorporating pressure-, temperature-, and composition-dependent trace element partitioning into the thermodynamic code.    This study will improve our fundamental understanding of volcanism and the nature of the Earth's mantle generally. It will examine the role of lithologic heterogeneity might play in the compositional evolution of volcanoes and test the universality of the Hawaiian pattern of volcanic evolution. This research will support a doctoral graduate student and several undergraduates from both Cornell University and University of Texas at San Antonio (a minority serving institution). In addition, research findings will be integrated to undergraduate and graduate geochemistry/petrology courses regularly taught by the PIs."

However, direct observations of colloid transport in unsaturated soils have typically been limited. As a result, differing and conflicting colloid transport mechanisms have been proposed for the effects that the air phase plays on the retention of colloids, with little predictive ability to date. Proposed are pore-scale visualization studies of colloid movement and retention in unsaturated natural sand. These observations, coupled with breakthrough measurements, will allow greater understanding of the actual mechanisms governing colloidal transport in unsaturated media. Our hypothesis is that capillary forces determine the unique features of colloid retention and release in the thin water films where the air-water and water-solid interfaces closely approach each other in unsaturated porous media. We will investigate how the nature and magnitude of interfacial interaction energies through changes in properties of both the porous media such as surface roughness and the colloid properties  will result in observable and predictable changes in capillary force-dependent retention behavior  including  water meniscus contact angle, extent and location of retention  at the air-water-solid interface; 3 D reconstructions of images obtained using bright-field microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy will be analyzed digitally and used to quantify the movement and retention, rates of colloids. These experimental results will then be used to test and quantify the mechanisms that governing colloid retention and transport in unsaturated porous media.    Recent experience confirms that the role of colloidal transport in groundwater contamination is typically ignored in the environmental regulatory and assessment sphere. The research will improve the knowledge on how micrometer-size colloids move in unsaturated hydrological systems and thereby will help improve models in order to make possible more accurate predictions of conditions under which groundwater contamination can take place."

However, to access and to make it available to the tools of genomics, the molecular variation of maize needs to be discovered at a very high resolution.  This project will develop methods to discover and then score DNA polymorphisms (variants) using several leading edge technologies.  Polymorphisms will be discovered and scored at nearly 400,000 locations in the genome.

This process, termed speciation, involves the origin of barriers to genetic exchange between diverging populations.  Recent studies in a variety of organisms have shown that rapid evolution of proteins involved in animal reproduction can lead to genetic barriers.  The goal of this project is to define the molecular basis of reproductive isolation between a pair of closely related insect species.  Modern genomic and proteomic approaches will be used to identify and characterize rapidly evolving reproductive proteins in these insects and to test how these proteins contribute to observed barriers to fertilization.    Understanding the diversity of mechanisms involved in speciation requires insights from a variety of model systems.  The insects studied here have been very well characterized with respect to ecology, behavior, and population genetics, and these data provide the essential context for analyses at the molecular level.  Knowledge of barriers to fertilization in insects has potential consequences for understanding similar barriers in other organisms. To provide even broader impacts, this project includes a major educational component: the development of materials and museum exhibits designed to educate the general public about speciation and the role of reproductive isolation in the origin of biodiversity."

The peroxide regulon (PerR) repressor is a member of the Fur (ferric uptake regulator) family of metal-dependent repressor proteins. PerR functions as a sensor of peroxide stress by reacting with hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radical, which modifies histidine residues that coordinate the bound Fe2+ cofactor. The resulting oxidized protein is inactive for DNA-binding. The OhrR protein contains a highly reactive cysteine residue that reacts with organic peroxides to generate a cysteine-sulfenic acid that then reacts with low molecular mass thiols to generate mixed-disulfides. Oxidized OhrR also forms a sulfenyl-amide derivative. These protein modifications inactivate the repressor leading to expression of organic hydroperoxide resistance. This project addresses the detailed mechanisms by which protein oxidation regulates the activity of these two proteins. This research will determine whether oxidized PerR is degraded, or the subject of a novel protein repair pathway. The effects of protein oxidation on OhrR will be investigated, and proteins that contribute to reactivation of OhrR will be defined. Related regulatory proteins are present in diverse bacteria, including important plant and animal pathogens where they function to regulate genes important for virulence. This research will address fundamental aspects of protein chemistry and oxidation. Protein oxidation is important in the life of all cells and is thought to contribute to ageing and numerous age-related diseases. The project will train students at all levels in genetic and protein chemistry techniques."

The work will specifically address questions related to plasticity in the olfactory system, using several moth species including the corn earworm and the tobacco budworm.  The investigators will transplant antennal imaginal discs between males of different moth species to study the interactions of sensory nerve cells with central neuronal types in the olfactory structures of the insect brain.  Previous studies have shown that challenging the insect antennal lobe using this transplantation technique results in the development of unexpected sensory input, including re-routing of neurons that arborize in a novel fashion in the olfactory area of the brain, which results in changes in functional interpretation of sensory inputs.  The results indicate that there is considerable plasticity in the mechanisms regulating the identity, guidance and targeting of sensory and central neuronal pathways, which can result in changes in the neural processing and behavioral discrimination of odor quality.  The current award will address in part the specification of central olfactory projection neurons with respect to growth and development in defined spatial locations in the antennal lobe. The investigators will also examine the functional significance of novel projection neurons with respect to their output.  The combination of behavioral and neurophysiological approaches to be used will provide generally applicable insights into the mechanisms that control the wiring of connections between neurons in the brain.  This approach is of importance because it involves a natural chemical communication system, containing relevant odors in the life-history of the insects, which can be analyzed with very sensitive behavioral assays and established neuroanatomical and physiological techniques.

This behavior may be connected to a high velocity micrometeor flux, since Ca is among the most refractory of the meteoritic constituents.  The study will involve observations and modeling.  The observations will include meteor head-echo radar observations using the 430 MHz incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and Ca, Ca+, and K metallic densities using lidars, all at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  The theoretical effort will involve the improvement of existing models of the Micrometeor Input Function (MIF).  This comprehensive model includes solar system meteoroid populations, atmospheric entry and ablation mechanisms, which allow for the estimation of the geographical, seasonal, and diurnal variability of the meteoric mass deposition in the upper atmosphere of particles in the sub-milligram mass range.  The results will also be compared with major laboratory studies of the pertinent reactions of Ca and Ca+, which are being conducted by a collaborating group in the U. K.  The combination of atmospheric measurements, laboratory experiments, and models will, for the first time, allow a description of the full picture of the formation of sporadic calcium layers observed at Arecibo.

Gaining an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms employed by bacteria to deliver specific proteins at the right time and the right place will provide fundamental insights into the engineering of proteins for bacterial delivery and for developing novel strategies for disrupting pathogen infection.  The main objectives of this project are addressed in the following questions: How are proteins able to be injected in a functional form into the host after having been requisitely unfolded in order to navigate the narrow lumen of the needle-like protrusion of the TTSS?  What are the fundamental requirements that a given protein must meet in order to be successfully translocated from a bacterial pathogen into the host cytoplasm?  This project employs fluorescence and NMR spectroscopies to investigate relationships between intracellular bacterial pH and the intrinsic folding equilibrium of effector proteins, with the overall goal of establishing the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters that facilitate coordinated effector delivery into the host cell.   The outcomes of this research project should provide fundamental insights into how novel proteins might be engineered for bacterial delivery into host targets, and for developing novel strategies for disrupting a major mechanism of pathogen infection.      The results of this project will help fill a large gap in our understanding of how bacteria deliver proteins to host cells.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this repression are not well understood. An evolutionarily conserved BON1 gene in Arabidopsis has been identified as a negative regulator of defense responses and cell death. This repression involves the regulation of one of the disease resistance (R) genes that are central for the specificity determination of defense responses in plants. How BON1 represses defense responses involving the R gene SNC1 will be addressed in this study. Additional target genes of the BON1 family function will be identified through isolating natural modifiers of the BON1 family mutant. Components mediating the BON1 regulation of defense will be isolated through bon1 enhancer and suppressor screens.    This is one of the first studies to genetically and molecularly dissect the repression of defense responses by plant host genes. It will shed light on the mechanisms underlying the induction of defense responses at the R gene level by an imbalance of cellular homeostasis or impairment in growth and development. Furthermore, the role of BON1 uncovered in  Arabidopsis  will  serve  as  a  model  for  functions  of  its copine homologs in animals, and thus  enhance our understanding of copine-involved biological processes in humans.

Recent developments in language research have increasingly put the spotlight on prosody, e.g. the intonational contour of utterances and the way syntactic bracketing is encoded in natural language.  An improved understanding of prosody and parsing of natural speech would be important not only for a better understanding of human speech processing but also beneficial for automatic speech recognition and synthesis.     Leading research questions include the following. What type of information about syntax, semantics, and context is reflected in prosody? How much of that information can a listener retrieve from the signal? How does this information facilitate language processing in online conversations? What do disfluencies and pauses in production reveal about the cognitive processes involved in planning and producing prosodic structure? How incremental is the planning and production of prosody, and what does it reveal about incremental speech production more generally?  The conference is intended to be a venue for exchanging ideas and methodologies, for learning about different perspectives, and most importantly for stimulating discussion and inspiring new ideas, projects, and collaborations.

By far, most of the information that we  generate as a society represents pictures, sounds, and  videos, and for this kind of data, lossy compression   yields a tremendous reduction in transmission and storage requirements. The aim of this project is to   understand the fundamental limits of lossy compression,especially in the context of networks, which dominate today's communication infrastructure. Previous work on this problem has not led to a fundamental understanding  of lossy network compression nor has it had a significant  impact on the design of practical systems.     This research overcomes the limitations of prior work  using two novel approaches. First, the highly general models  of the past are eschewed in favor of canonical, concrete  problems that are simultaneously more tractable and more  relevant to applications. Building on recent results of  the PI, the work develops a comprehensive and conclusive  understanding of the fundamental limits of lossy network  compression for Gaussian sources under quadratic distortion  constraints and discrete sources under erasure distortion   constraints. Second, these fundamental limits are studied  under more realistic scenarios in which the source, the network,  and the allowable distortion all change in unpredictable ways.  To help students learn how to create probabilistic and  information-theoretic models that are tractable yet also  applicable to real systems, existing courses at both the  graduate and undergraduate level are being remade to include  greater emphasis on modeling. The project also includes significant outreach, involving an interactive tutorial  on compression delivered to women and underrepresented-minority  engineering undergraduates and rural high-school students."

This CAREER project will develop an advanced simulation environment for modeling degradation of structures and materials using a multi-physics approach and object-oriented design. To limit the scope of the project, the simulation environment will be developed in the context of a specific application: corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. This research project will integrate fundamental theories and computational tools to model the complete corrosion-induced damage process in reinforced concrete. The approach to be followed include the description of the coupled multi-physics phenomena (i.e. heat and mass transport, electrochemistry, and mechanical damage) through nonlinear systems of coupled partial differential equations and the implementation of numerical methods such as finite elements for the solution of these systems of equations. The processes involved in corrosion-induced damage have been studied separately in the past, but a holistic approach that allows for modeling the complete corrosion degradation process is still lacking. The proposed research will develop new knowledge for reliably coupling moisture, heat, and ionic transport, generation of corrosion products, and the ensuing mechanical damage.    The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the development of a holistic and multidisciplinary approach for studying degradation of structural systems. Moreover, the simulation environment developed in this research will serve as a virtual laboratory for studying complete life cycles of structures, facing one of the modern challenges of computational mechanics.  Deterioration of infrastructure deeply affects our society. Invariably, all structures degrade over time and it is imperative that we learn how to predict changes in the safety limits of structures. The realistic assessment of reduction in structural capacity using a holistic approach is still needed. This research project addresses these issues from the context of corrosion in reinforced concrete, but uses a general approach easily expandable to other deterioration mechanisms found in structures such as aircrafts, cars, nuclear containers, dams, space vehicles, etc. In addition, the multi-physics framework used in this research and its implementation using an object-oriented design will serve as paradigm for the solution of complex problems found in other engineering and science areas such as biology, physics, chemistry, materials science, etc.     Degradation of structures is intrinsically a multi-phenomena process, which requires multidisciplinary thinking. Students involved in research and classes related to this project will have to gain knowledge from a variety of areas such as heat and mass transport, physical chemistry, solid mechanics, and computational methods for the solution of partial differential equations. The object-oriented design approach adopted in this research will allow for easy expansion and adaptation of the software to other deterioration mechanisms found in other areas of engineering and science. The proposed simulation environment will be open source and available to the research and practicing community. The educational component of the project encompasses curriculum expansion, internships at a national laboratory, and outreach programs. The project aims at increasing the number of Hispanic students that pursue engineering and science degrees. The Hispanic population in the US is growing at an expeditious rate, while the number of Hispanic students that pursue engineering degrees is currently very small."

This research focuses on algorithms which meet  provable guarantees in the face of such uncertainty.    Recent developments in online learning theory and algorithmic mechanism design have opened up the exciting  prospect of designing efficient algorithms with meet  provable worst-case guarantees while still performing nearly as well as existing algorithms in the common case.  The intellectual merit of such algorithms lies in providing an appealing bridge between worst-case and average-case  analysis.  The PI will pursue this prospect in several application domains, including multi-agent learning systems (studying algorithmic notions of trust and reputation based on extending online learning techniques to situations in which multiple learners share information) and auctiondesign (exploring the roles of optimal stopping theory, learning theory, and randomization over outcomes in the design of approximately profit-maximizing auctions).

The first goal of this project is to develop a reliable significance analysis for profile based de novo motif finders. This analysis can then further assist in delineating the theoretical limit of these finders and in pushing their performance envelope toward that limit. Over the last few years several new types of data emerged that were successfully integrated into motif finders.

These virtual environments are vital for a wide variety of applications, including e-commerce, education, industrial design and architectural planning, games and movies, safety analysis and virtual training, and cultural heritage.  Realistically simulating the visual appearance of the real world is extremely challenging because scenes of interest have complex geometry, material, and lighting interacting across a wide range of physical scales, ranging from millimeter-sized surface bumps to large-scale structure. We call such scenes scale-complex.  Current rendering methods are blind to scale, making it infeasible to realistically simulate the complex paths along which light reflects and scatters in such scale-complex scenes.  This project develops a novel framework for realistically rendering images of scale-complex scenes. Importantly, the framework supports rich illumination phenomena and rendering effects such as indirect illumination, participating media, subsurface scattering, motion blur, and depth-of-field.    For the proposed framework to be scalable, it must perform well even with growing complexity of the scene and of simulated illumination phenomena. This project explores the following new approaches: (a) a unified treatment of all illumination phenomena and rendering effects, (b) novel multiresolution representations coupled with perceptual metrics based on early vision and higher level vision to eliminate computation where it is not visually important, (c) new methods for accurately computing illumination detail as needed, with illumination-driven simplification of geometry and material, and (d) new hybrid CPU/GPU algorithms for interactive performance."

A novel method for precisely controlling the geometrical and magnetic distribution of nanoparticles inside a polymer matrix will be devised by controlling the particle size and chemistry of the nanoparticles as well as the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating magnetic fields employed to induce negative viscosity effects during the electrospinning process.   The use of induced negative viscosities in polymer nanomanufacturing will be studied by a combination of multiphysics-based modeling and customized experiments. The mathematical modeling section will attempt to develop algorithms to simultaneously couple electromagnetic and transport phenomena in viscoelastic media. The experimental approach will include the use of a customized electrospinning device as well as the implementation of analytical methods based on magnetic force microscopy and electrostatic force microscopy.  Even though the research is of fundamental nature, its discoveries can open an avenue for the manufacturing of novel composite structures not possible to achieve by any other method.    If successful, the findings could provide a competitive advantage to the American manufacturing and polymer processing industries as novel structures and materials could be produced at higher throughputs, lower costs and higher levels of control.  The ability of using induced negative viscosity effects to control the position of particles with nanoscale precision could potentially be expanded to develop novel anti-counterfeiting devices aimed at protecting intellectual property rights and curtailing the counterfeit of high value goods.  The education and outreach components of the plan seek to enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in research activities as well as to leverage prior investments of NSF in education and K-12 outreach programs.  The PI will continue involvement in community outreach programs through the Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America, and will develop training modules for workshops that reach teachers working in districts serving underrepresented ethnic minorities.  Furthermore, the PI will continue involvement with professional organizations to promote the pursuit of graduate education in sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics among Hispanic youth."

The PI, Julia Thom of the Department of Physics at Cornell University, will lead a program to develop silicon pixel detectors for the Compact Muon Spectrometer at the upgraded Large Hadron Collider (Super-LHC) at CERN. The research goal to understand the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking relies on the precise measurement of charged particle trajectories provided by silicon pixel detectors. In the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, electroweak symmetry breaking is associated with the existence of a Higgs particle which has yet to be discovered. While the discovery of the Higgs Boson is most likely to occur at the standard LHC, the increased luminosity at the Super-LHC will provide the statistical power to study its properties in detail. The discovery of the Higgs particle and the measurement of its quantum numbers are of utmost importance in particle physics today. The proposed program includes design, simulation and testing of cutting-edge pixel sensor technology that can withstand the extremely high radiation doses and tracking densities at the Super-LHC. This work will be carried out in collaboration with researchers at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and partners in industry. Based at Cornell University in upstate New York, the PI has learned that there are no regular science education programs that target schools in surrounding poor rural communities. In particular, the number of girls in this region pursuing higher education in science or engineering is alarmingly low. The proposal includes initiating a program that provides mentoring and science summer camps for girls, teacher workshops, and regular visits to six schools that have been classified as high-need and that show particular interest in this program. The program will be implemented in collaboration with a professional educator, whose research interest in science education in rural poverty settings matches the goals of the PI.    Intellectual Merit:  The development of a new silicon pixel detector is essential to take advantage of the luminosity upgrade of the LHC for detailed studies of many of the new and possibly revolutionizing phenomena that are expected at the TeV energy scale. Since no known technology can withstand the enormous particle rates expected at the Super-LHC, the development of innovative silicon pixel detector technology built on the recent progress of the silicon processing industry would be a breakthrough in the field of particle detection. If successful, this development would have many important applications in x-ray imaging for biology and astrophysics.    Broader Impact: The research project requires an extensive collaboration between the Fermi  National Accelerator Laboratory, the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell, and partners in industry. The project provides an opportunity to provide graduate and undergraduate students with the experience of interdisciplinary research at the cutting-edge of pixel detector technology. The science education program would encourage girls in underserved rural areas to pursue careers in science and engineering, serve as a tool for the professional development of teachers, and bring the excitement of science to the broader community."

Through fieldwork with the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) team, the research will develop a detailed case study of how images are used to develop scientific conclusions, and to operate the Rover at a distance. Of specific interest is how the Rover team uses images to make Mars visible and legible, and how these visualizations inform the researchers' inferences about the planet. The project thus constitutes a practice-based approach to questions of visual epistemology in the context of contemporary space exploration: that is, it focuses on the social and technical achievement of knowledge-making about Mars based on visual representations of its surface. Drawing on fieldwork with the MER team at Cornell University, and visits to other MER sites in California, Arizona and Missouri, this project will address several aspects of image analysis in the Rover project. Participant-observation data will be collected at daily group image dissection activities which are essential to the mission: meetings between engineers and operations managers to decide what the Rovers are 'looking at' and what, based on the visual evidence, they should do next; and discussions among scientists which determine whether or not an image constitutes pictorial evidence that there was once water on Mars. Situating the Rovers within a larger historical context of Martian imaging and imagining, the project will explore how raw images become trustworthy and evidentiary, probe the disciplinary and disciplining activity of astronomical image processing, and discuss the development of the Rover's software tools with respect to the visual languages and conventions of the interdisciplinary research team. Throughout, the dissertation will develop and employ an analytical framework for analyzing theory- and practice-laden representation in science, and explore the theme of visual objectivity as it is managed through digital tools. NSF funding will support ethnographic field work, interviews, and archival work at Cornell, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and satellite Rover laboratories, test sites, and image processing centers in Arizona and Missouri. The intellectual merit of the project is in its contribution to the study of images in science. It specifically addresses the problem of digital objectivity: the epistemic, practical and moral management of images that is simultaneously diagrammatic and pictorial, manipulated and mechanically produced. Further, it brings tools from social construction of science and technology programs into the virtual sphere, unpacking software suites as social constructions and exploring such STS concepts as inscriptions, immutable mobiles, and the externalized retina in the context of digital image processing. Finally, the analysis of theory laden representation also possesses broad potential application to other social and historical studies of images in science. Beyond the Social Studies of Science, however, the project has a broader impact. As twenty-first century 'big science', the Rovers are plugged into an outreach network involving scientists, schools and legislators. Images play a central role in this network of exchange and thus deserve close and careful scrutiny as instruments of public opinion, knowledge, and funding strategies. Close ethnographic attention to collaboration over distant networks by means of visual technologies may also reveal insights for future technological developments in Computer-Supported Co-operative Work. Finally, the Rover mission is a project of historic significance: the careful documentation and analysis of daily interactions around its images as essential, yet ephemeral, digital artifacts presents a strong contribution to a developing history of the early digital era."

Funds will support travel to archives both in the U.S. and Japan and will permit the examination of one critical yet understudied aspect of Japanese experimental biology in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth century: how the source of raw silk, the silkworm (Bombyx mori), emerged as a model organism in Japanese genetics. Japanese scientists began developing inbred pure lines for producing F1 (first filial) hybrid silkworms at the turn of the twentieth century. The development of the silkworm as both a model organism and a commercial entity allows for a unique study of the construction and use of scientific expertise in Japanese biology, as well as to understand how the silkworm could be made emblematic of Japan. The cultural and monetary value of this agricultural insect, which became a model object for research, raises questions about how biological research developed in Japan, and in particular, how inquiries about heredity were tested and applied not only to silkworms but to humans as well. The overarching objective of this project is to understand how locally-situated knowledge about sericulture reinforced a platform for political discussions of the human race in Japan. To explore why and how the silkworm came to be viewed as an object of scientific and racial knowledge in Japan, this project approaches the silkworm case from three angles: the development of scientific work on silkworm heredity and genetics; changes in the sericulture craft and silk industry; and changes in the pictorial representations of silkworms. The project will overall gauge how the silkworm research community developed its expertise and the extent to which it interacted with social policymakers and Japanese state interests about race and the eugenics to manage it. This dissertation project will make an intellectual impact by combining historical studies of agriculture, genetics, and race science in new ways, especially in the context of international trade and imperialism. The project will advance our understandings and knowledge of the history of Japanese bioscience, namely how silkworm science helped institutionalize genetics in imperial Japan. The focus on silkworm materiality will supplement historical and social studies of model organisms and scientific standardization in ways that will add to theoretical critiques of the relations between agriculture and racial thinking. The broader impact and implications of this study relate to the connections between science, race, and national selfhood, which is a recurring topic of social importance today. The study will provide a historical reference point for contemporary discussions about the racial implications of selective animal breeding as well as national support for research and the commercialization of life through agricultural biotechnology. The study on the history of the silkworm, a major Lepidopteran (moth and butterfly) model organism, will infuse discussions about genetically engineered plants containing Bt toxin, which targets members of the same family. This project will make important and timely contributions to political and technical debates over global business activities and changes in local cultural landscapes that place science and technology seemingly at odds with tradition. Preliminary work on this project has also begun promoting interaction between the fields of science studies and East Asian studies."

In the early nineteenth century, two physiologists, Charles Bell and Francois Magendie, became embroiled in a debate over the proper practice of physiology, a debate that emerged within the context of a priority dispute over the discovery of the separate roots of motor and sensory nerves. The dispute, which began in 1822, lasted for over twenty years and was not settled decisively within either Bell's or Magendie's lifetime. This priority dispute provides an entry point for an evaluation of connections between medical institutions and physiology and between pedagogy and research practice in nineteenth-century Britain. It allows for a discussion of ways in which British physiologists responded to competing models of experimentation in early medical sciences. Moreover, this controversy illuminates the ways in which communities of physiologists made sense of living bodies and the ways in which theory and practice were taken to be mutually supportive elements of discovery.  More specifically research supported under the NSF dissertation support will allow the following questions to be answered: how did a debate over priority and experimentation embody divergent pedagogical cultures and alternative models for a discipline in formation? In what ways did the structures of British medical and surgical institutions lend themselves to a particular pedagogical style, publishing priorities, and perceived audience revealed by Bell? And can we identify wider political contexts for the role of vivisection or the role of experimental science in clinical medicine that help to explain the significance of this controversy to Bell's contemporaries? The intellectual impacts of this work include shedding light on the role of pedagogy in the establishment of research methodologies in the biological sciences; enhancing understandings of the ways in which natural philosophy and early science were incorporated into medicine; and exploring alternative models of experimentation. Furthermore, it will discuss the place of pedagogy within the print culture of the early nineteenth century. It will also have broader impacts by contributing to the training of a historian of science; it will produce an understanding of the politics and ethics of the early uses of vivisection both in research and in educational contexts; it will examine the role of nationalist politics in the resolution of priority disputes, and it will contribute to an understanding of the intertwined debates about ethical and technical aspects of research practice. Although much work has been done on continental physiology and medical sciences, British life sciences of the early nineteenth century remain understudied. The priority dispute between Bell and Magendie, which helped to unite British anatomists, promises to reveal the philosophical, professional, and pedagogical of a natural philosophical culture struggling over the place of experimentation in medical science. The fierce rivalry between French and British philosophers seen through this dispute serves to indicate that a British model of physiology provided serious competition for the French experimental model and merits further study."

Barrett 	CO-PI Annemie Maertens     This field dissertation research analyzes quantitatively the effects of identity and social network on educational investment, agricultural technology adoption and market participation decisions and differentiates these effects along pathways (social learning, discrimination, social norms, imitation, price-scale effects and effects on the agent's resource constraints) using data from six villages in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The villages selected for this study have been studied before by ICRISAT in its Village Level Studies (VLS) during the period 1975-1985, and as such detailed background information and data on both household and village level characteristics are available.            This dissertation research thereby addresses an important gap in the development economics literature. Recent studies in economics acknowledge the importance of (non-productive) identity and social networks in economic decision-making. Social networks and identity mediate the mapping from resources into outcomes through their effects on preferences, constraints and expectations, thereby influencing economic decisions such as investment in children's education, technology adoption decisions and market participation decisions. However, none of the existing studies have differentiated these effects along the following pathways: learning from one's contacts (often referred to as social learning), discrimination (i.e., prices or access to certain goods is different for members of different identity-based groups), price-scale effects (i.e., the value/cost of a good depends on the number of users), social norms (i.e., a rule in a certain locality that is socially enforced through sanctions), imitation (i.e., copying the actions of certain people one observes), and easing of labor, capital and credit constraints (e.g., friends and family give a helping hand on the land during harvest, lend machinery or provide loans). Differentiating these effects along these different pathways is important from a policy perspective as the right strategy to stimulate educational investment, increased and quicker uptake of promising technologies, and market participation depends fundamentally on the structure of the decision process at the household level.            Concretely, the goal of this research is threefold: first, to contribute to the methodological development of the field of development economics by introducing a set of relatively new data-collection techniques, such as 1) the within-sample random technique where individuals who are part of a random sample are randomly matched with other individuals within the same sample and asked about past and present links, their willingness to establish a (hypothetical) link with him/her and their perception of his/her ability and social and cultural attributes and 2) the collection of information on subjective expectations and 3) the capacity to mobilize information by conducting small experiments; second, to develop an identification strategy to separate out the different social network and identity effects in the data; and third, to make the data and the data collection methodology publicly available, thereby ensuring that the policy implications of this study extend beyond the Indian case."

The leaf is a ground state lateral organ; the developmental mechanisms generating leaves are repeated and modified during development of inflorescences and flowers. Thus, an understanding of leaf development is central to our comprehension of overall plant development.  Previous molecular genetic analyses in diverse plant species have generated testable models for mechanisms of leaf initiation and growth.  In addition, comparative approaches are important for better understanding how diverse leaf morphologies have evolved, and may be utilized for agronomic advantage in the future.  This research will exploit recessive mutations that affect the initiation and/or expansion of leaves.  Experiments will investigate the expression patterns and functions of these genes, helping to elucidate more about the development and morphological evolution of leaves. Three specific aims are proposed.     (1) The maize/Arabidopsis genes NARROW SHEATH (NS)/PRESSED FLOWER (PRS) are required for the initiation of lateral leaf domains from shoot meristems.  Maize and Arabidopsis leaves are simple, whereas tomato forms compound leaves comprised of many leaflets.

Proposal Title:  Collaborative Research: First-Principles Calculations of Phonon Thermal Transport in Bulk and Nanostructured Materials    The research objective of this collaborative effort is to develop a theoretical approach to describe thermal transport through bulk and nanostructured materials from first principles.  A central feature of this approach is that it has no adjustable parameters. This will allow the study and understanding of phonon thermal transport and lattice thermal conductivity in a host of bulk semiconductors as well as in novel nanoscale systems. Systems to be investigated include: Bulk crystals such as silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide; nanostructured systems such as quantum well and quantum wire superlattices, structures with significance interface resistance, single and multilayer thin films, defects in nanowires and nanotubes.    Intellectual Merit   Current approaches to model thermal transport in insulating and semiconducting materials are typically based on either highly parameterized relaxation-time approximations or on purely classical molecular dynamics calculations. The rigorous first principles theory to be developed here has no adjustable parameters and incorporates fully the quantum mechanical phonon scattering processes. It will therefore provide predictive power to support ongoing and future experimental studies of thermal transport in nanomaterials, as well as contributing to the development of new nanomaterials engineered for specific applications.     Broader Impacts   This three-year project will provide training for one postdoctoral researcher and one doctoral graduate student. In addition, undergraduate students will participate in this project through NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates programs at the Boston College and Cornell sites.  Computational tools developed during this project will be integrated into a free set of phonon thermal transport tools that will become part of the computing library established at the Cornell Nanoscale Science and Technology Facility (CNF). These computational tools will be available for use by any researcher. This research program will contribute to the development of new materials with desired thermal transport properties. This will facilitate technological breakthroughs in thermal management for the next generation of thermoelectric materials, thermal barrier coating materials, and thermal interface materials."

Furthermore, Congress has passed a number of laws protecting the air, water, and other aspects of the environment, which suggest that the environmental movement is a force in American politics.  The research will analyze the impact of international and national environmental protest and social movement advocacy groups on environmental legislation in the U.S. Congress. To address this question, the investigators will collect information on protest events, activities by environmental organizations, and histories of environmental bills as these narratives unfold over time. Specifically, they will assemble information on environmental legislative histories and environmental social movements, in order to study the central argument that the effects of congressional-level factors, public opinion, lobbyist activities, and social movement activities all influence policy outcomes, but that they do so at different stages in the legislative process. The research contributes to sociological knowledge by assessing the impact of protest and advocacy activities of citizens and organizations on legislative change.  It highlights the specific sequence of events in the legislative process that may influence the likelihood of success or failure at each stage of the process.     A broader impact of this project is that it will address fundamental debates in the social sciences about the nature of democratic political processes. In particular, it will explore whether or not pro- and anti-environmental protests and organizations matter to legislative outcomes, net of the effects of party preferences, voting records, and partisan majorities in Congress. Moreover, because this project analyzes the impact of domestic and international social movement activity on the entire policy process, findings will have relevance to those interested in understanding the effects of global processes. Finally, by developing procedures for classifying bills with identical goals, the project will provide data for other researchers interested in capturing the histories of distinct policy proposals over time."

Fractals possess a lot of structure that can be used to advantage in this task.  The P.I. will continue his research in this area, with the general goals 1) to extend the depth and scope of the theory for basic examples, and 2) to extend the breadth of the class of fractal Laplacians.  In particular, he will investigate problems in the following general categories: distribution theory, differential equations, quantum mechanics, the energy Laplacian, spectra of Laplacians, energy and Laplacians on the Hilbert gasket, and the method of outer approximation (a new method of constructing fractal  Laplacians recently introduced by the P.I.).  Some of the research will involve \"experimental mathematics\" to be carried out in collaboration with undergraduate students (mainly REU students).    	Mathematical analysis provides scientists with the tools to model real world phenomena.  However, classical analysis makes the tacit assumption that the underlying space is smooth.  The real world is filled with rough objects.  In recent years, mathematical analysts have attempted to construct theories of differential equations on rough spaces.  Fractals give examples of spaces that are both extremely rough and yet have a great deal of structure that allows the development of an analytic theory.  One approach was pioneered by Jun Kigami in Japan and intensely developed by the P.I. and his colleagues.  This theory has produced a deep understanding of certain idealized examples, such as the Sierpinski gasket and related spaces. Although these spaces are far too symmetric to occur in objects in the natural word, they have already appeared in manmade objects (antennas, and nanomolecules).  This project will continue the mathematical development of the theory of these key examples, and also broaden the theory to encompass wider classes of fractals, with the hope of developing tools that can be used in modeling naturally occurring objects.  Part of the project will involve the emerging methodology of \"experimental mathematics\", in which computer simulations are used to explore mathematical questions in the hope of formulating conjectures that may eventually lead to conventional mathematical proofs.  The P.I. has been very successful in using this approach in the past, and will continue to develop it in collaboration with undergraduate students."

Deformation modeling has made enormous progress, but we still desire increasingly realistic levels of geometric and dynamic complexity.  Deformation also plays an important role in multimodal feedback for virtual environments: feeling contact forces using haptic interfaces, seeing realistic deformable appearances with shadows and interreflections, and hearing contact sounds. Not only are accurate deformations required at high rates, but the phenomena can also be extremely complex.    Given the conflicting demands of real-time interactivity and complex large-scale simulation, one logical algorithmic strategy is to do as much work ahead of time as possible. Exploiting massive precomputation and data-driven tabulation is appealing, but how this can be done, and to what extent, remains a mystery for most nonlinear systems. Nevertheless, preliminary evidence suggests that potential precomputation speedups are easily a million-fold.  By researching precomputation techniques today, we stand to exploit million-fold speedups for multimodal simulation on supercomputers of tomorrow.    Our scientific objective is to understand how to systematically precompute, simulate and experience data-driven models of large-scale nonlinear deformable systems.  We address these goals in three ways: (1) precomputation techniques for data-driven deformable models based on reduced coordinate representations; (2) deformable motion databases of complex motions for real-time ``playback;'' (3) multimodal aspects of interactive simulation, including haptic rendering of contact forces, data-driven deformable sound models, and precomputed deformable object appearance models.  Our research is driven by real-world applications, and will be explored in the broad context of interactive computer animation, virtual medicine, robotics and manufacturing, and simulation of large-scale natural environments."

In general, a pulse of light spreads out in space and time as it propagates, owing to diffraction and material dispersion.  However, under some conditions it is possible to make a pulse of light that does not spread or disperse, and such a pulse is called a soliton.  The central theme of this project is the investigation of pulse propagation in layered, periodic structures, which may support soliton formation by \"managing\" the effects that generally cause localized wave fields to disperse. A specific goal is to observe spatiotemporal solitons, which are referred to as \"light bullets\" in recognition of their particle-like character. Such solitons have never been observed experimentally.  The work will be carried out in collaboration with groups from Tel Aviv and Barcelona.    The issues addressed and concepts developed in this project range from the fundamental science of nonlinear dynamical systems to practical laser instruments.  There are substantial parallels between the nonlinear propagation of optical pulses and the evolution of Bose-Einstein condensates.  The same is true of plasma physics and hydrodynamics. There is great interest in the study of light-matter interactions under extreme conditions, and deeper understanding of spatiotemporal pulse propagation will facilitate this.  Soliton formation can be used to produce pulses/beams that are not available directly from lasers, and this drives application interest and even commercial interest. Finally, light bullets may be useful as bits of information in future all-optical computing or information-processing systems. The simple concept of a localized packet of electromagnetic energy, along with the visual nature of experiments with light, will allow experiments constructed for the project to be used for high-impact demonstrations of basic phenomena to students in a senior-level undergraduate class on nonlinear optics."

H. Steen, Cornell University - Endowed      Surface tension at a liquid/gas interface is known to be cohesive and liquid capillarity at small scales exerts an attraction between adjacent solids. The super-adhesion exhibited by the palm beetle is capillarity-based. Its ability to grab and release depends on manipulating a large number N of small volumes of liquid held by surface tension. This study of the fluid mechanics of release has a focus on the volume-scavenging instabilities that can occur when two or more capillary surfaces (e.g. droplets) connect, enabling volume exchange. Modeling and computation will provide the scientific basis for the target task -- to experimentally realize a man-made adhesive pad inspired by the beetle -- and to better understand the beetle's remarkable capability.     Intellectual merit. The normally weak force of surface tension can be effectively amplified by parallel action. The palm beetle, an insect native to Florida, exhibits extra-ordinary adhesion ('super-adhesion') as a defense mechanism using just this strategy. Its stickiness derives from making contact with 120,000 tiny droplets of oil. Together, these little liquid bridges make a bond that can withstand a force up to 100 times the beetle's body weight. Perhaps, most surprisingly, this bond can be released in less than a second. How does the beetle release itself? Provided volume exchange between liquid bridges is possible, one bridge can scavenge volume from its neighbors. When does this instability occur and, if it does occur, can it ease detachment? Can scavenging be avoided or enhanced in a man-made device? It is proposed to answer these questions. They belong to a study of the stability of a system of N coupled nonlinear liquid components. Statics gives the energy landscape and the dynamics of volume transfer is important when scavenging competes with the detachment time-scale.    Broader Impacts. Nature provides a variety of controllable adhesion examples (house-fly, gecko, etc). The beetle is distinguished by its control of pico-liter volumes of liquid oil. Understanding the beetle's mechanism(s) of release is (are) important not only to the naturalist but to the engineer. The feasibility of man-made adhesives, of strength per unit weight comparable to what the beetle exhibits and that can be turned on/off (grab/release) on the order of a second, is addressed by the proposed study. Hence, immediate impact will be on man's capability to build a switchable super-adhesive pad for a breadth of applications (ceiling-hanging robotic devices and so forth). More broadly, it is well-accepted that adhesion between two solids and spreading at a liquid-solid interface are closely related to the issue of friction between moving parts and dissipation in the liquid coating of solids. More efficient coating processes would impact both industrial production and daily human activities. The highest level impact will be on the science base for understanding the stability of systems of N-coupled capillary elements. Finally, an impact through education of students will accrue from the study, as well as outreach to the public. Numerous accounts of nature-inspired technology in the popular press strike a positive chord, as they should."

This project focuses on Hilbert's sixteenth problem for quadratic vector fields, the infinitesimal version of Hilbert's sixteenth problem, and several related topics. The latter include the following: algebraic solutions of polynomial differential equations in higher dimensions; rigidity of complex polynomial foliations; relations between moduli of elliptic curves and rotation numbers; new problems about analytic families of germs of conformal maps, related to so-called mixed families. The first part of the project is based on two major results obtained under the principal investigator's previous award. The first of those results is an almost complete solution to the restricted Hilbert problem for quadratic vector fields. This solution is to be completed in the current project. In its final form, this solution would provide a \"covering function\" on the space of quadratic vector fields, a covering function with the following properties: (1) it is finite and lower semicontinuous on the set of vector fields that have no polycycles (separatrix polygons); (2) its restriction to this set has an infinite limit on the exclusive set of vector fields with polycycles; (3) it majorizes the number of limit cycles outside the exclusive set. The principal investigator proposes to find an upper bound on the number of limit cycles by establishing a local persistence property for limit cycles and then replacing the covering function with a cut-off function that still majorizes the number of limit cycles. The maximum of the cut-off function will be the desired upper bound. The second major objective of the current project is the complete solution of the restricted infinitesimal Hilbert sixteenth problem. This solution involves another covering  function, this time on the set of all ultra-Morse polynomials of given degree, with the following property: it majorizes the number of real zeros of an Abelian integral of any polynomial one-form of degree smaller than the given one over the real ovals of a real ultra-Morse polynomial. The covering function has poles on the set of non-ultra-Morse polynomials. Once more, the goal is to prove a local persistence theorem for zeros of Abelian integrals and to derive an upper bound for the number of these zeros by replacing the covering function with a cut-off function. This will solve the infinitesimal Hilbert problem. The problems described in the latter part of the proposal (algebraic solutions, rigidity, moduli of elliptic curves, mixed families) lie at the interface of differential equations, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry. While they are of independent interest, at least half of them are related to Hilbert's problem.    The theory of dynamical systems is divided into two parts: multidimensional systems (the realm of chaos) and two-dimensional systems (the realm of order). Hilbert's sixteenth problem is a central one in the theory of two-dimensional systems. It is well known that two-dimensional dynamical systems provide models for various problems in physics, engineering, and biology (e.g., predator-prey models in biology). The understanding of real two-dimensional dynamics is therefore a subject of general scientific interest. On the other hand, the study of complex extensions of real dynamical systems provides important new information about real systems and is interesting in its own right. Indeed, some experts even say that the \"Book of Nature\" is written in the language of complex analysis."

Prior work on high-energy pulse generation has focused almost entirely on the harmful effects of nonlinearity.  Fiber-based devices offer a unique opportunity to investigate nonlinear effects: because the light is guided, the spatial consequences of nonlinear phase accumulation (which would destroy a beam) are suppressed. A group from Cornell University will perform theoretical and experimental studies of the limits of optical-fiber-based sources of ultrashort pulses of light.  Virtually all previous designs of lasers and amplifiers for high-energy pulses are based on avoiding nonlinearity. The Cornell group will pursue new approaches based on harnessing and exploiting nonlinear effects, rather than avoiding them. Initial results of this approach suggest that it should be possible to generate stable pulses with peak powers two orders of magnitude higher than reported previously with fiber devices. This regime of pulse propagation has not been explored previously.    Broader Impacts  The impact of the proposed research will extend beyond nonlinear pulse propagation. The concepts developed in this project range from the fundamental science of nonlinear dynamical systems to practical laser instruments.  Fiber lasers have the potential to be extremely compact and robust, and inexpensive compared to other lasers. In addition to facilitating scientific research, fiber-format sources of femtosecond-duration optical pulses have great potential for expanding the range of short-pulse optical techniques into \"real-world\" applications such as precision machining and diagnosis and treatment of disease.  Despite their potential, short-pulse fiber lasers have had limited impact on science and technology, because their performance has lagged behind that of solid-state lasers. The proposed effort provides a route to fiber  devices that should combine the performance of solid-state instruments with the practical benefits and reduced cost of fiber.  Successes in the proposed research will translate into designs of short-pulse fiber lasers that are likely to be commercially viable, and the commercial development will enable a wide range of applications. Finally, the proposed effort will be coupled to undergraduate and graduate classroom teaching. The instruments proposed for development will be stable and reliable, and thus ideal for part-time use in laboratory demonstrations.  The Cornell group has a track record of attracting under-represented minorities, primarily women, to his laboratory.  This is expected to continue and expand, through connections to centers at Cornell that have historically attracted substantial numbers of students from under-represented groups."

Meiotic recombination is the main source of genetic variation, responsible for creating new gene combinations in the progeny.  The role of recombination in evolution of eukaryotes and the mechanisms that regulate recombination frequencies are central questions of modern biology.  However, while much is known about the mechanistic aspects of recombination, including a large number of meiotic proteins that have been identified, factors that regulate rates of meiotic recombination remain poorly understood.  To understand the quantitative regulation of the meiotic recombination pathway, the extent of variation in recombination rates must first be examined.  This study explores the variation in global (across the whole genome) recombination rates using a set of 27 diverse inbred lines that capture over 80% of allelic diversity in maize.  The recently developed chromosome painting techniques are used to measure the numbers of crossovers on each of the maize chromosomes.  In addition, chromosomal foci of two recombination proteins, RAD51 and MLH1, which mark two main recombination intermediates, are quantified.  Natural diversity in key maize recombination genes is also explored.  The set of diverse maize inbreds is used to examine variation in DNA sequence of these genes as well as their level of expression.  The data generated within the scope of the project will serve as a foundation for future research to identify QTLs affecting meiotic recombination frequencies in maize and to examine associations between the variation of recombination frequencies and variation in candidate recombination genes.  Eventually, this research will lead to elucidating mechanisms that regulate meiotic recombination rates in plants.    Understanding the mechanisms of recombination is a central issue in plant breeding because recombination generates new genetic variation on which breeders apply selection.  Plant breeders could use hyper-recombinogenic lines to reduce linkage drag during introgression of traits, obtain recombinants representing new desirable combinations of genes, use smaller breeding populations, and accelerate the breeding cycle.      Outreach and training of undergraduate and high school students are an important part of this project.  These activities are integrated into the Plant Genome Outreach Program at Cornell/Boyce Thompson Institute (http://outreach-pgrp.cornell.edu).  This program, established in 2003, facilitates a large number of diverse outreach efforts funded by the NSF Plant Genome Research Program.

In applications where appearance matters, from designing textiles and apparel to rendering virtual actors to formulating hair cosmetics, understanding how these materials' physical properties affect their motion and appearance is crucial. Fiber-based structures behave differently from other materials.  A knit fabric is much more extensible than its component yarns because the yarns can bend and slide into different macroscopic shapes.  A head of long hair moves freely but smoothly, making and breaking millions of hair-hair contacts to produce a partly smooth, partly discontinuous overall motion.  This research aims to improve the accuracy of cloth and hair simulation by fundamentally changing the underlying physical and computational models.    The project follows an approach of measurement, modeling, simulation, and validation.  Image-based measurement is used to capture complete fabric deformations.  This data, together with the literature on yarn-level textile mechanics, is used to develop constitutive models based on the actual physics of fabric, which are simulated using advanced numerical methods not normally employed in textile simulation.  The results are being evaluated both against the laboratory data and in the context of real problems in apparel design. By bringing together the tools of modern graphics and simulation with the detailed models of textile mechanics in a rigorous process of validation, this project is placing computer graphics cloth simulation on a firm scientific foundation for the future.  Computational methods devised for fiber-fiber interactions are also being extended for efficient strand-level simulation of hair.  After the simulations are validated, the project will examine approximations and algorithms to allow efficient simulation.  The end result will be new, physics-based models for the mechanics of cloth and hair that are appropriate for visual applications."

These trends challenge the state of technology for modeling realistic workloads on sufficiently detailed hardware or system simulators. Computer system designers traditionally rely on simulation experiments to evaluate properties (such as performance, energy consumption, and thermal characteristics) of proposed designs. Unfortunately, growing system complexity renders many traditional simulation-based approaches woefully inefficient or obsolete. The bottom line is that computer designs and workloads have grown sufficiently complex that modeling them fully in detail is utterly intractable.  Researchers and practitioners lack the necessary tools to understand the many interactions of diverse hardware components and software requirements, and thus there is no assurance that coarse-scale modeling of large design spaces is sufficient to identify design points representing the most important tradeoffs for any given system.    The proposed research attacks the problem of exponential design space and configuration space exploration via an automated approach that builds accurate, confident, and predictive models. Sample points in the design space are simulated, and the results are used to teach the models the function describing relationships among design/configuration parameters. The models produce highly accurate predicted results for other points in the space, can be queried to predict impacts of parameter changes, and are very fast compared to simulation, enabling efficient discovery of tradeoffs among parameters in different regions. The research agenda includes investigating ways to reduce the number of sample points required to develop accurate predictive models, applying the approach to new hardware design spaces, and using predictive modeling to jointly configure software workloads together with the hardware on which they run."

QMC is one among the most precise known techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provide a significant gain in precision compared traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches. This will bring electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo methodology to a qualitatively higher level of applicability to complex materials and lead to increased accuracy. The new QMC techniques will be applied to forefront problems in the properties of Earth materials in order to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. One significant limitation of today's QMC methods is the high computational demand, which currently makes applications to larger systems including solid solutions prohibitively expensive. A substantial portion of the QMC computation is spent on forming and evaluating a Slater determinant, which is constructed from one-particle orbitals. The team plans to develop and apply different localization transformations in order to obtain a sparse determinant. Two linear algebra methods will be developed for their efficient evaluation. First, Krylov's method for the iterative evaluation of a determinant will be incorporated into QMC. Secondly, the trace of the determinant will be calculated with Monte Carlo methods.

We will obtain rigorous results for the sequentially Markovian coalescent, which has recently been introduced as an approximation for genealogies with recombination, investigate the nature of regulatory sequence evolution in Drosophila and other organisms with large effective population size; study the subfunctionalization explanation of the persistence of gene duplicates, and consider random Boolean networks, in order to gain insights into gene networks. Inspired by ecology, we will use spatial models to understand conditions needed for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation between individuals, and we will investigate changes that occur when the parameters governing the interactions in predator-prey and epidemic models evolve.  The last decade has seen the generation of incredible amounts of DNA sequence data. However, having the text of the instruction manual that controls life is just the beginning, we need to understand how the expression of genes is controlled and how genes interact in biological networks. These interactions cannot be directly observed so one needs to develop mathematical models to test hypotheses, and to infer how genetic systems evolved to operate as they do. In particular, our research will investigate (i) how rapidly changes can occur due to regulatory sequence evolution, which is commonly quoted explanation for many of the differences between humans and chimpanzees, (ii) whether or not the subfunctionalization hypothesis provides a satisfactory explanation of the paradox of the preservation of gene duplicates, and (iii) to improve our understanding the patterns of variations caused by adaptive evolution.

These complex systems depend on a large number of parameters, but study has indicated that they often exhibit general underlying characteristics that can make complex systems understandable as simple systems. The project will add to our general understanding those features which are intrinsic to complexity and thus transcend the detailed features that make up a particular complex system. While complex systems nearly always have a very large number of parameters needed as specifications, most are often unimportant is system operation, hence the assignment of the term ``Sloppy Model Universality'' to this feature.    The investigator will use this notion of sloppy model universality to develop new methods for making models simpler and more understandable without losing the essential scientific information they contain, and to develop computer algorithms to solve models faster. Not only models, but complex system, like living things, should also share in this transcendent behavior; this project will explore implications for evolution.     The Broader Impact of this research derives from its highly interdisciplinary character.

Due to the atomic nature of materials, attaining the ultimate in device performance is expected to require atomic-level precision in the preparation of surfaces and interfaces. The properties of oxide films are very sensitive to oxygen content. For example, a small increase in oxygen concentration changes strontium titanate films from an insulator into a semiconductor and then into a metal. Developing the ability to control and confine oxygen vacancies remains an important barrier to realizing the full potential of oxide electronic devices. This project will develop and explore the potential of a new technique (time-resolved diffuse x-ray scattering) to characterize oxygen vacancies in  such films during their preparation.

The PI will continue to work with elementary and middle school teachers on projects developing hands-on modules tailored to meet the goals of the NY state mandated physics curriculum and to disseminate these materials at in-service teacher training events.      Technical Abstract    This project will use time-resolved, synchrotron-based, hard x-ray (10 KeV) techniques to characterize the atomic scale processes governing the growth of thin-films via pulsed laser deposition (PLD). This project will explore the potential of using the diffuse x-ray scattering from the long-range strain fields of point defects (Huang scattering) to characterize the concentration, spatial distribution, symmetry, and anticipated clustering of oxygen vacancies in SrTiO3 films deposited via PLD.  In contrast to spectroscopic techniques which are sensitive to the concentration of atoms or molecules, diffuse x-ray scattering is directly sensitive to the vacancy concentration.  This project will support intensive training in advanced synchrotron-based x-ray techniques and in the growth of complex oxide thin-films by PLD to a graduate student and a post-doctoral research associate. The PI will continue to work with elementary and middle school teachers on projects developing hands-on modules tailored to meet the goals of the NY state mandated physics curriculum and to disseminate these materials at in-service teacher training events."

Ruina's  previous research shows that, in principle,  a robot could walk,  say, 10-20 km on a single battery charge much like a person can  walk a similar distance on energy from a good meal.  In practice,  however, typical robots today only walk tens of meters. The  efficient machines fall down too often.  The stable machines run  out of energy.    Today's robots are either efficient or stable,  but not both. This shortcoming represents a lack of understanding  of the nature of balance using foot placement.    Ruina's approach will build on his Cornell lab's success in  making bipedal robots whose energy use, per unit distance and  mass, is comparable to that of humans.   The  new  robots will  improve on the robustness in the previous efficient machines by  using controlled foot placement for balance.    Successful design and construction of the proposed new robots  will demonstrate the utility  of holding energetic efficiency,  control simplicity and control robustness paramount in the design  of humanoid mechanisms.

Theoretical issues connected with quantum coherent transport will be addressed to resolve several outstanding theoretical questions and experimental results that remain unexplained. Two research areas will be engaged. The first thrust addresses the physics that limits quantum interference: scattering from time-dependent potentials and fields. In disordered metal wires, the theory of phase breaking is established, but much work is needed in quantum dots and ferromagnets.  The PI aims to develop a microscopic theory of phase breaking in a 'double quantum dot', in which all parameters that govern the strength of the phase-breaking rate can be accessed. In ferromagnetic conductors, experiment suggests that the phase-breaking rates in 'strong' (elemental) ferromagnets are much larger than in normal metals, although the mechanism for this enhancement is unclear. Some candidate mechanisms, for example fluctuating domain walls, magnons, and impurities, have been explored, but the picture is incomplete and will be investigated further. The second thrust deals with the quantum interference corrections themselves.  The research advances the theory in ballistic conductors. In addition, the research addresses the question of how and when quantum interference corrections depend on whether the microscopic motion is ballistic or quantum-disordered.  A goal of this research is to extend the theory, and to look at quantum corrections that involve interference as well as electron-electron interactions.    NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This award supports theoretical research and education on size effects and alterations of materials properties at the nanoscale, with an aim to enhancing our ability to make predictions and characterizations for current carrying nanostructures and nanodevices. As nanotechnology progresses to even smaller device components, the movement of electric charge through the circuits becomes less like traditional electronics and the behavior must be described in terms of quantum mechanics. The wave description of electric current includes scattering and interference and the influence of other electrons.  The PI will work on the quantum theory of electrons that flow in devices that are smaller than a millionth of an inch in size.  The geometries of nanodevices make this complex and the interaction of waves in nearby device components is not well understood and so is a main aspect of this research. Advances in this are required if we are ever to actually reach a miniaturization of electronics to the size of a few hundred or so atoms. Engaging students, graduate and undergraduate, in the theoretical physics behind such leading edge technology is both enlightening for undergraduates and an excellent career starting point for dissertation student. This award contributes to the effort to keep America competitive both through contributing to the intellectual foundations of future technologies and to the training of globally competitive workforce."

From a design perspective, energetic effects are readily tunable by introducing chemical disparity in selected components, while entropic inter-chain interactions can be strongly influenced by changing the molecular weight distribution and the extent of entanglements in the system. Accordingly, model networks will be synthesized under different conditions and characterized to address three questions: 1) To what extent can one enhance the toughness of networks that exhibit entropy-driven order-disorder microphase segregation by coupling such segregation with energetic forces arising from a chemical disparity between chains and crosslinks? 2)  What is the effect of the entropic disparity brought about by chain length multimodality on network structure and mechanical properties? 3) What is the interplay between chain interspersion and entanglements (both entropic chain interactions) on rubber elasticity and toughness? - A judicious choice of cross-linkers in poly(diethylsiloxane) elastomers can result in energetic attraction between the cross-links and lead to increased toughness in these materials. Synthetic and characterization efforts along with coarse-grained computer models will be carried out for this purpose. Secondly, deuterium NMR measurements on samples where different components of multimodal elastomers are labeled will be used along with computer simulations to provide an understanding of the increased toughness of multimodal structures. Finally, experiments and simulations will be carried out to investigate the different roles of trapped entanglements and chain interspersion on the mechanical properties of elastomers.    NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    Elastomers are elastic materials such as those encountered in soft contact lenses, tires, rubber bands, certain biomedical devices, O-rings, etc. This research focuses on how the properties of the polymer molecules that make up these elastomers affect their end-use and what can be done to improve these materials or develop new ones. Of particular interest would be the synthesis of an elastomer that mimics the mechanical behavior of natural substances, like the muscle protein titin, that exhibit the ability to absorb large amounts of deforming energy without breaking (e.g., for applications entailing soft materials under severe stresses).  Students, both graduate and undergraduate, will be directly involved in this research that will provide them with educational and research training in the general area of polymer science and engineering. The Principal Investigators will participate in educational outreach activities such as Materials Workshops for upstate New York high school teachers and the Curie Academy for high school girls."

If one restricts attention to spaces with strong geometric properties (such as metric trees or CAT(0) spaces), one can often make the set of actions of  G   into a topological space itself, called a  deformation space, with good topological properties.  The automorphism group of  G  acts on the deformation space by twisting each action to get a new action.   In this project we study automorphism groups of various classes of groups by studying their actions  on deformation spaces.   For free groups, the relevant deformation space, originally defined by the PI and M. Culler, is known as Outer space.  A fairly recent development in this subject is that Morita used a connection found by Kontsevich between Outer space and a certain infinite-dimensional symplectic Lie algebra to detect cocycles for  Out(F_n), the group of outer automorphisms of the free group of rank n.  The PI and J. Conant have reinterpreted these cocycles as cycles on the quotient of Outer space by the action of  Out(F_n), and plan to use these to study the unstable cohomology of Out(F_n).  A second goal of this project, joint with R. Charney, is to develop an analog of Outer space for right-angled Artin groups, a class which includes both free groups and free abelian groups.  A third component is motivated by previous work of the PI on stability of the homology of  Out(F_n) and Aut(F_n).  Techniques developed for proving these stability results apply to other sequences of groups related to low-dimensional topology, and the PI will  further investigate these applications. Other ongoing projects include a study of the space of phylogenetic trees and an investigation of  rigidity properties of Out(F_n).                    A phenomenon which occurs throughout mathematics and the sciences is that complicated structures can often be understood more easily by codifying the information they contain in terms of graphs and trees.   On example of this is the use of graphs and trees to describe the possible splittings of an algebraic object called a group into simpler pieces. When there are many possible splittings, one can construct deformation spaces which measure the ambiguity.   In this project we study groups by considering actions of the  symmetries of the group on such deformation spaces."

Ta thin films can be deposited in two different phases each having very different and very useful properties. The alpha phase is the bcc equilibrium phase found in bulk materials. The beta phase is a tetragonal metastable phase that is normally only found in thin film form. At high temperatures, the beta phase spontaneously transforms to the alpha phase, but reported transformation temperatures cover a large range. Ta is known to incorporate a large amount of oxygen and this has been shown to retard the transformation. PIs have found that films deposited in the alpha phase have a typical grain structure of columnar grains with preferred orientation along the film normal and diameters on the order of the film thickness. Alpha-Ta films formed by the beta to alpha phase transformation, however, have a microstructure which, to PIs' knowledge, has never before been reported for a metallic material. This structure is characterized by continuous orientation changes and a discontinuous grain boundary structure. Understanding this microstructure and its properties, as well as understanding the conditions under which the beta phase may be stabilized, are expected not only to contribute to fundamental knowledge, but to generate new possibilities for micro- and nanofabricated devices. The project will combine experimental work with modeling and simulation both at a high level to understand: (1) the structure and stability of the beta phase, (2) the detailed mechanism of the beta to alpha phase transformation, (3) the microstructure of phase-transformed alpha films, (4) plastic deformation and stress levels, and (5) effects of impurities in thin Ta films. PIs have developed specialized equipment over the years that will allow them to generate films with very good control over composition and microstructure, and to interrogate the different constituents of those films in detail using synchrotron x-rays and many other methods. Dislocation- and Molecular-dynamics simulations and density field theory calculations will be done to understand these behaviors across scales from atoms to films. NON-TECHNICAL: The Baker group has been very active in communicating science and technology to a wide range of audiences, and this effort will be continued and expanded in the project. As in the past, PIs expect several undergraduate researchers to participate in this project and to publish their results. PIs will continue to provide a series of outreach experiences to K-12 students and the general public. PIs will generate an activity on crystal structures for middle and high school students, asking the question, can a crystal change its orientation gradually? Baker group graduate students participate extensively in outreach through advising undergraduates and through K-12 outreach activities. PIs will make a virtual reality 3-D materials microstructure tour at the CAVE and the Cornell Theory Center for use by students and scientists alike. As a group PIs have a particular interest in providing high school teachers with opportunities to participate in research. The PI recently generated a program to bring 92 high school teachers to a major technical meeting in Boston for a wide range of activities. PIs will generate research opportunities for teachers through the present project; teachers will come to Cornell and participate in a well defined portion of the project. The PI also participated in the formation of the Nanoscale Informal Science Education (NISE) project which will provide the graduate and undergraduate students in the group with a wide array of opportunities to expand their outreach experience and expertise."

The research focuses on the development of novel polypropylene synthetic chemistry and an exploration of the fundamental physical phenomena underlying nucleation and growth in quiescent and flow-induced crystallization of semicrystalline polymers.  Specifically, the PIs will use branching architecture as a tool to control nucleation and thereby manipulate the final crystalline morphology and macroscopic material properties.  The team assembled to achieve this goal is skilled in novel polyolefin synthesis, crystallization kinetics and structural characterization, rheology and flow-induced crystallization, and industrial polymer processing.  Model isotactic polypropylene (iPP) materials, including narrow molecular weight distribution linear, star, H-, and comb polymers, will be synthesized with precisely controlled stereoregularity and location of branch points.  Quiescent crystallization experiments will principally seek to ascertain: (1) the influence of increasing chain irregularity due to branching on the level of crystalline organization and relative content of the alpha and gamma phases in homopolymer samples; and (2) the type and conformation of branching architecture that enhances nucleation in blends with linear chains.  Flow-induced crystallization of linear and branched iPP blends will seek to determine: (1) how crystallization kinetics, nucleation density, degree of crystallinity, and crystalline structure are influenced by branching for fixed longest relaxation time; (2) if molecular architecture alters the local segmental orientation to promote nucleation; and (3) how polymorphism and morphology depend upon the number of arms (stars), ratio of branch to main chain molecular weight (H-polymers), and number of branch points (combs).    NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY  Over 43 million tons of thermoplastic resins are produced in the U.S. each year with an estimated market value of over $65 billion.  Much processing is performed in an ad hoc manner without the benefit of modeling or coherent blending strategies.  Since the raw materials are often not renewable, waste in processing has a significant environmental impact.  Moreover, the ability to exert better control over crystallinity and crystalline morphology will lead to better films, lighter weight parts, and also inject inexpensive PP materials into novel applications due to extended material properties.  By providing quiescent and flow-induced crystallization data on well-defined material systems, theoretical tools allowing quantitative predictions of semicrystalline morphology are expected to result from this work.  Students in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering will be not only be exposed to modern polymer synthesis and characterization, rheology, and material characterization techniques (e.g., X-ray scattering, birefringence, optical and transmission electron microscopy), but they will also be able to participate in industrial research experiences at ExxonMobil.  The PIs will also combine their diverse talents and perspectives to assemble a K12 educational program on \"Plastics\" to be adopted in their respective communities.  The PIs also have a record of including underrepresented groups in their research efforts (e.g., undergraduates from Ghana and Panama and several female undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs).  Additionally, the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is a jointly managed program of FAMU, a historically black college and university, and FSU with 40% minority and 25% female enrollment, and numerous African-American undergraduates have conducted undergraduate research in the laboratory of the PI at that institution."

The project aims to address the following issues which have arisen in modeling correlated data: extra zeros in count data, non-linear functional relationships and measurement errors.  Frequently it is of interest to make marginal inference about trends and effects of explanatory variables on correlated counts. Failure to account for the extra zeros may result in biased parameter estimates and misleading inferences. The investigator proposes a generalization of the standard zero-inflated regression model to the correlated data case, allowing for a Heckman-type selection process. Measurement Error Models offer coverage of estimation for situations where the model variables are observed subject to measurement error. The second part of the project focuses on developing Semiparametric Measurement Error Model for dependent data using two approaches: the first is based upon the idea of Monte Carlo corrected scores and the second is a generalization of the SIMEX (simulation-extrapolation) method to general semiparametric models.    Semiparametric regression is concerned with the flexible incorporation of non-linear functional relationships in regression analyses. The investigator is particularly interested in correlated data which arise in a variety of settings in many areas of applications: Biology, Genetics, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Medicine, Econometrics, Engineering and Sociology. In many practical situations the attribute or event of interest is rare and/or other variables preclude observation of an event, consequently a higher proportion of the counts than implied by standard models may equal zero. Part of the focus of this proposal is to develop semiparametric models for the correlated data with extra zeros. When there is an uncertainty in measuring covariates, the usual regression estimators are biased and when the measurement error is substantial, alternative procedures are necessary. Part of the emphasis of the proposal is on developing semiparametric measurement error regression models for dependent data. The statistical methodology to be developed will be circulated to the statistical community in academia and industry through series of papers and publicly available programming code. On the educational front, some of the research material in this proposal will be incorporated in courses at the undergraduate and graduate level. Some projects will also serve as dissertation topics for Ph.D. advisees and will therefore play an important role in the training of future statisticians."

In this project, the physics and astrophysics related to the surfaces, atmospheres, and magnetospheres of highly magnetized neutron stars will be studied.  The work is essentially organized into two parts. First, quantitative calculations of the cohesive properties of condensed matter in strong magnetic fields will be performed.  These are fundamental quantities characterizing magnetized neutron star surfaces.  The possible observational consequences of strong surface cohesion of neutron stars with strong magnetic fields will also be explored, including surface condensation and the development of polar gap accelerators (relevant to radio emission) in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars.  Second, the basic physics of proton/ion cyclotron line transfer in a variety of environments will be studied, and applied the physics to neutron star atmospheres and radiation bubbles in magnetar outbursts.  Dr. Lai's ongoing program of numerical modeling of partially ionized neutron star atmospheres of heavy elements will also be continued.

A common thread  running through these problems is the following mathematical  structure: a non-convex potential energy in the lower-order  terms, which includes the loading, in addition to a small,  higher-order regularization (or singular perturbation),  characterized by a small parameter e > 0.  The main goals of this  work are: (1) to provide classes of rational models --  particularly in the case of multi-phase lipid-bilayer membranes  -- for understanding the often exotic behavior of such  structures; (2) to systematically find equilibria corresponding  to local minima of the total potential energy or meta-stable  solutions.  In addressing (1), observe that mechanical  experiments on real materials often begin with a homogeneous  specimen that progressively develops increasingly complex  patterns or micro-structure under steady, quasi-static changes in  loading.  The investigator employs rational continuum models,  characterized by general constitutive functions, and looks for  thresholds of bifurcation and exchange of stability to compare  with experiment.  In particular, meta-stable solutions are the  ones presumably observed in quasi-static experiments.   Accordingly for (2) he considers a new methodology based upon:  (a) rigorous existence of solutions for arbitrarily small e > 0  via symmetry-breaking global bifurcation methods and a-priori  bounds; (b) efficient and reliable global numerical  path-following to find meta-stable states.          The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive  mathematical analysis for the quantitative characterization of  shape and deformation patterns of certain micron-scale structures  under applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,  shape-memory alloys and thin films.  Each of these has direct and  important connections to basic science and technology.   Lipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems;  understanding and predicting their mechanical behavior is crucial  for understanding cell function.  The project focuses on simple,  man-made membranes or liposomes.  The future promise of liposome  vesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug delivery demands  a fundamental understanding of their mechanical behavior under  loading.  Likewise for phase transitions in shape-memory alloys  and wrinkling/blistering of thin films -- a fundamental  understanding and the mathematical prediction of their behavior  are important for characterizing the mechanical properties of  novel materials and for potential sensing and actuation at the  micron scale."

An exemplary case of this is in the fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, where the male fertility factors that are on the Y chromosome in most fruit fly species have translocated to a small non-sex chromosome.   This finding is striking since male-related genes usually move onto rather than away from the Y chromosome. The analysis proposed will use the latest DNA sequencing technology, computer simulations and modeling techniques to elucidate the structural changes involved in this gene movement.       This project began as a collaboration with Dr. Bernardo Carvalho, a faculty member of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.  He continues to visit for two weeks each year, sometimes bringing a student from his lab, so the current proposal can be considered as ancillary to another positive international collaboration.  The study is central to Amanda Larracuente's Ph.D. thesis, and the prior studies in the area have already provided training and educational experiences for several undergraduates in the lab, including Belinda Haerum and Elizabeth Larimore.    Male infertility is a common genetic disorder, and studies of model systems at this level provide clues as to why populations maintain observed levels of Y-linked male sterility."

This NSF-NIRT award is centered around the active integration of nanophotonics, nanofluidics, nanomaterials and single molecule physics into a new field, refered herein as ''Nanophotofluidics''. The assembled team consists of researchers from Cornell University and the University of Rochester bringing distinct individual expertise to form the integrated, multidisciplinary research program to exploit the extremely high optical intensities achievable in our newly developed 50nm wide exposed mode ?slot waveguides? to perform optofluidic tweezing and propulsion (by exploiting polarization and scattering/adsorption forces) and demonstrate a series of new active nanoscopic single molecule and multi-particle analytical tools.     Intellectual Merit    This program is divided into three focused research areas: 1) develop a better fundamental understanding of the coupling of electromagnetics and hydrodynamics on the nanoscale to demonstrate the core elements of a broader nanophotofluidic transport architecture, 2) demonstrate the most resolute separation mechanism developed to date, and  3)  develop a new mechanism for investigating single protein folding dynamics in solution.     Broader Impacts     Integrating photonic elements as active components in micro- and nano-fluidic devices represents a largely unexplored area that could have significant impact that could be extended into a broad new class of photonically driven microfluidic devices where rapid, network based particle manipulation is performed using the high-speed components already developed by the telecommunications industry.  Such platforms may find application in emerging fields such as nano-assembly (offering all the advantages of optical tweezing but more rapidly and with sub-wavelength precision).  A fundamental part of this program is an outreach and education strategy consisting of: 1) The development of a series of integrated educational units distributed to K-12 classrooms nationwide through the Cornell Main Street Science program and 2) An interdisciplinary nanoscience and engineering seminar series for the upstate New York area. This seminar series will attract attendees from both universities as well as undergraduate institutions in upstate New York. The talks will also be posted on a dedicated website for download. Students from the target institutions will also be given the opportunity to post questions on a dedicated website which will be answered directly by the speaker or the PIs.

This project aims to ameliorate this neglect by accomplishing two objectives: 1) complete a molecular phylogeny, a hypothesis of evolutionary relationships based on the study of DNA, for the entire genus, and 2) produce a taxonomic revision of section Astrapaea, a well-defined group within Dombeya.    In developing countries, like Madagascar, widespread poverty compels unsustainable land use making immediate conservation action imperative. Yet, successful conservation and biodiversity management efforts require a sound taxonomic foundation, which is often lacking for tropical taxa.

The objectives of the proposed research include:  1.	Automatic Calibration and Uncertainty Analysis: We aim to provide a transformative general methodology to do automatic calibration, multivariate sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analysis for large watershed models.  Earlier methods require thousands of simulations, which could take over a year of computation for a large model. The focus for this proposal is to apply the new methods for automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis for the first time to watersheds.    2.	 Augmentation of Sensor/monitoring Networks: We will also develop a procedure to determine the best locations to add new sensors or monitoring stations to integrate with an existing data collection network.  The analysis uses a watershed model to evaluate the value of new data obtained by the new sensors and compares to the values of alternative schemes for data collection that differ in terms of constituents measured and the location or times of measurement. The analysis incorporates the tradeoff between resources and accuracy.  3.

In contrast, most current approaches rely on successive stages of processing, in which individual features are first detected and then those features are combined in order to detect objects.  A central focus of the project is not only to determine which objects are present in an image but also to localize those objects and their subparts.  Objects are modeled as a collection of local patches arranged in a deformable configuration, where certain pairs of parts are connected by spring-like connections.  These models provide a way of exploiting local contextual information, delaying decisions about the presence or absence of individual features until more is known about other features and the spatial relations between them.  Such models can further be adapted to the larger problem of representing scene-level context, encoding both the context immediately around an object and more long-range relationships between objects in a scene.  This project is investigating both the use of local context to improve detection of features and objects, and the use of scene context to improve the detection of objects and relations between objects, within a single overall optimization-based framework.    Accurate recognition and localization of objects is of central importance for applications and systems that use computer vision to interact with the world, such as mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, interactive games, animation and film-making, tele-operation for hazardous situations, and remote surgery.  In such applications, a computer vision system must not only determine whether objects are present in a scene, but also identify where the objects are and what pose or configuration they are in.  For instance, detecting a pedestrian for an automotive safety system should also inform the car and driver where the pedestrian is located.  In applications such as tele-operation and interactive games, further detail about a person's pose and gestures are required to enable hands-free control of complex systems.  This project seeks to advance the capability of such systems by taking an approach based on simultaneously combining multiple sources of information into a single overall decision, rather than making multiple smaller decisions that are each potentially error-prone    Progress on this project will be regularly reported at http:// www.cs.cornell.edu/~dph/context/"

In recent years, we have seen tremendous progress in the development of SAT solvers, which search for satisfying assignments. Current SAT solvers handle problem instances with over one million variables and several millions of constraints. An intriguing research question is whether the advances in SAT technology can be exploited for other key reasoning tasks central to AI.     This project considers three such tasks: (1) quantified Boolean reasoning, key in multi-agent reasoning and reasoning in adversarial settings, (2) counting of the number of satisfying assignments, which has many applications in probabilistic inference, and (3) sampling from the set of satisfying assignments, which is closely related to model counting. The broader impact of the proposal will be the design and development of efficient solvers for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) and algorithms for model counting and sampling applicable to a wide range of users working in areas as diverse as verification, planning, adversarial reasoning, and probabilistic reasoning."

Part of the challenge in designing silicon integrated circuits that can meet this demand is to overcome limitations in the efficiency and frequency bandwidth of modern transistors.  Here it is proposed to use two-dimensional networks of inductors and capacitors to overcome these limitations.  These high-speed, high-efficiency networks have a cut-off frequency that is higher than that for silicon-based transistors.  Moreover, such networks can be incorporated into standard silicon chips that can be fabricated at low cost.  The proposed research has the potential to revolutionize high-frequency analog signal processing, leading to chips that operate up to 1000 times faster than current ones.    There are a large number of possible designs for such networks, and only a small number of these possibilities have already been explored.  The proposed research seeks to develop algorithms that greatly assist in the simulation and design of two-dimensional inductor-capacitor networks.  Simulating a large network involves the solution of a large, coupled system of equations that can be simplified greatly through mathematical analysis.  It is proposed to use this simplification to develop fast, scalable algorithms and codes for network simulation.  This would enable engineers to quickly learn the effect of changing one or more of the thousands of parameters in a typical large-scale inductor-capacitor network.    It is also proposed to use optimization methods to automatically design lattices that achieve prescribed input-output relationships.  The optimization work will use as a foundation the prior results of the proposers, including, for example, the development of a two-dimensional network that computes Fourier transforms in the analog domain.  Such physically motivated ideas will be coupled with modern tools of parallel numerical computing such as PetSC (the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) and TAO (the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization).  This will result in fast, accurate tools that enable engineers to rapidly optimize the design of a lattice to achieve desired performance specifications.    The expertise gained in carrying out the proposed research will enable the investigators to train students and researchers to solve problems in modern computational science and engineering. The proposed research encourages multidisciplinary interaction between scientists, engineers, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists spanning the spectrum from developers to users of computational tools."

This project is developing instructional modules at the undergraduate level that focus on mathematical modeling in the behavioral sciences. These modules cover such topics as mating strategies, contests, habitat selection, foraging, cooperation and conflict, and communication. The focus is on well-understood models of animal behavior, with students encouraged to extend the models to human behavior, politics, and economics. Modules can be used together in behavior courses or singly in introductory biology, ecology, evolution, sociology, or psychology courses. A secondary aspect of the project is enhancement of mathematics classes by introducing behavioral applications. Each module actively engages the student in developing a model. After watching video of a behavior that illustrates a question, a student identifies the relevant variables, formulates a model, translates it to mathematical form, makes predictions based on the model, tests those predictions with a graphical simulation, and designs real-world experiments that would test the model. These exercises give students experience with probability, game theory, and optimization methods. A manual for instructors suggests ways to incorporate the material into a variety of courses and indicates areas that students may explore further on their own. This material is being tested at a diverse group of colleges and universities. Evaluation includes comparative tests (lecture-only vs. module) and longer-term tests of retention and transfer of knowledge. Dissemination of the material through national meetings, educational publications, and distribution by a textbook publisher is broadening the impact of the project and increasing the exposure of undergraduates nationwide to mathematical modeling of behavior."

Editing is often essential for proper gene function and/or regulation.  In vascular plants, mitochondrial and chloroplast RNAs are modified by C-to-U base modification. Editing sometimes creates start codons for plant organelle proteins, and is required to restore codons that specify highly conserved amino acids.  RNA editing in plant organelles appears to be a correction mechanism to ameliorate T-to-C mutations that would otherwise prevent gene expression or result in non-functional proteins. Sequences surrounding C targets of RNA editing in chloroplasts are thought to be specifically recognized by proteins, perhaps recruiting other proteins involved in the enzymatic modification of C to U. The goal of this project is to identify unknown components of the chloroplast RNA editing apparatus. While cis-elements upstream of edited Cs have been identified, little is known about the trans-factors required to recognize the correct C and convert it to U.  Efforts will be made to fractionate maize chloroplast extracts for partial purification of the editing apparatus, which will be subjected to mass spectrometry for protein identification. Candidate editing complex members will undergo functional analysis. A high-throughput assay for editing of all chloroplast editing sites in a species will be developed. RNA sequence requirements for binding of editing factors will be determined. Antisera to an editing factor protein will be used in purification schemes to identify components of the editing complex. A combination of biochemical and molecular genetic approaches should allow dissection of the molecular apparatus needed to convert Cs to Us in vascular plant chloroplasts.               RNA editing is a fundamental biological process with profound effects on gene expression. Understanding how organelles in plants regulate this process may eventually result in applications that could improve agricultural productivity by increasing efficiency of energy acquisition and utilization by chloroplasts and mitochondria. This project will provide training in biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics for several graduate students and undergraduates. Materials useful for laboratory exercises in plant cell structure and microscopy will be produced."

Physiological costs result from a reallocation of resources from growth to defense, while ecological costs result from changes in flower morphology that lower pollination success. The goal of this project is to quantify these two fitness costs. The investigator proposes a series of manipulative laboratory and field experiments with native Solanum species to measure plant morphological, metabolic and reproductive responses to leaf herbivory. The data collected will test two main hypotheses: first, that herbivore-induced changes reduce the quality of the 'reward' to pollinators and second, that plants compensate for reduced pollinator attraction by increasing the extent of inbreeding and reducing pollen competition. The research focuses on herbivore-induced morphological and metabolic changes in flowers and the consequences of those changes for the pollination of two wild tomato species, the facultative outcrosser Solanum chmielewski and the selfer S. neorickii, both native to the Peruvian Andes.     This integrative research will evaluate the role and impact of herbivore-induced plant responses on the composition of arthropod communities and plant fitness and identify costs of induced plant responses. It will evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity in plant-insect coevolution and in compensating for major physiological and ecological costs, thereby expanding our understanding of the ecological importance of phenotypic plasticity. The data collected  will contribute substantially to the sustainable utilization of plant defenses in agriculture. The project is part of a larger integrative research network (ECO-SOL) under the umbrella of the Solanaceae Genome Project to close the knowledge gap around the natural history and ecology of the wild relatives of domesticated tomato.

For approximately 10 years, The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has been supporting a series of Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments to evaluate the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on terrestrial ecosystems.  One such experiment is the Nevada Desert FACE Facility (NDFF) in the Mojave Desert.  No other experiment has continuously applied elevated CO2 to a desert ecosystem.  The DOE is in the process of terminating its FACE experiments.  This decommissioning process represents a unique opportunity to complete a comprehensive analysis of how a desert ecosystem functions under elevated CO2.  During the shut down, DOE will only support research on ecosystem carbon storage.  This NSF research will leverage the DOE support to enable investigations of the effects of elevated CO2 on desert nitrogen cycling. The research will: 1) examine the amount and the isotopic signature of nitrogen throughout the ecosystem, 2) measure how nitrogen cycles and transforms within the soil and how this changes after the additional carbon dioxide is removed, and 3) measure the magnitude and isotopic composition of nitrogen gases emitted from the ecosystem following the removal of the elevated CO2 treatment.    In addition to influencing the overall response of the ecosystem to elevated CO2, changes in ecosystem nitrogen cycling have the potential to influence regional air quality, acidification of precipitation, food production, and human health.  This is especially true in the arid southwest because it is among the fastest growing regions in the US.  A firm understanding of the controls on emissions of nitrogen gases will help inform future policy and remediation decisions.

First, the project extends RDS to the study of social norms within the context of social network structure by mapping enforcement, compliance, and perception of knowledge-seeking norms onto the underlying social network structure of each population.  RDS is especially well suited for such analysis because it provides a random sample of behaviorally defined ties from within a social network.  The overall social network structure will be analyzed based on these ties and combined with survey questions regarding the social norms of respondents who make up those ties using the RDS homophily and affiliation indices.  Consequently, the research will provide important insights into the interaction between social norms and social networks.  Second, the project develops and tests WebRDS software, a fully automated online variant of RDS, for distribution to the general scientific community.  Finally, while the RDS estimator has been shown to be asymptotically unbiased analytically and computationally, the hidden nature of most RDS study populations has prevented large scale, multi-site empirical validation.  This project will provide such validation through comparison of RDS estimates with institutional data from two large undergraduate populations.    The larger research community will benefit from the methods developed in this project.  First, the development of WebRDS software will provide for very fast and efficient sampling of electronically connected institutions.  This will be especially useful for case control studies of epidemiological outbreaks where a reduction in time spent on data collection can prevent additional infections.  The method of social norm research developed in this project can be applied to any outcome variable that is potentially spread through interpersonal contact.  More immediately, the project will study knowledge-seeking norms in university students, a population recently identified by the U.S. Department of Education as declining in quality.

In human agricultural societies, it is usually males, particularly first-born sons, that remain at home and the extent of family wealth, measured as farmland, is a key factor. Males also tend to be the gender that stays home in birds and this leads to a variety of interesting consequences, including cooperative breeding, where sons provide aid by feeding chicks in their parents' nest, or less obvious social behaviors such as communal roosting, cooperative defense of the territory, and food-sharing by family members.  Like humans, western bluebirds ?own? land in the form of defended territories with mistletoe, which provides a continuous supply of berries over the winter.   Like farmers, the bluebirds ?plant? the seeds of mistletoe by passing the berries through their guts, leaving the seeds still viable and surrounded by a sticky coating that helps them to adhere to limbs and grow.  Western bluebird sons and some daughters tend to stay home with their parents during their first year of life.  When mistletoe abundance was reduced by half, fewer sons stayed home, suggesting that in western bluebirds, as in humans, wealth plays a role in delayed dispersal.  The current work will determine whether parental favoritism also provides advantages to sons staying at home and whether in staying, sons incur fitness costs in the form of increased competition with relatives, genetic costs of reduced offspring viability due to incest, and reduced mate availability due to incest avoidance.  Studying these factors will complete the picture of delayed dispersal for western bluebirds and help tease apart which is more important to sons staying home ? resources or the increased access to those resources that comes from living with nepotistic parents.  It will also establish the extent to which mistletoe is a keystone resource that is critical for western bluebird conservation."

This dramatic restructuring of embryo morphology involves epiboly, a process by which the embryonic cell mass spreads over the surface of the yolk. Epiboly is followed by gastrulation, a large-scale rearrangement of tissues leading to formation of germ layers that ultimately give rise to all the organs and tissues of the body.  An important focus of developmental biology research is to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling epiboly and gastrulation. Using molecular genetic approaches, Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories recently identified the calcium channel beta subunit as essential for normal epiboly in zebrafish. Classically, the beta subunit is thought to function as a critical auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), multi-protein complexes that mediate calcium entry into the cell. The auxiliary beta subunits (beta1- beta4) help transport the pore-forming alpha1 subunit to the cell membrane and modulate the electrophysiological properties of the calcium channel. However, recent research suggests that beta subunits may have additional functions in the cell independent of their roles in VGCCs. Mutations in the beta subunit lead to uncoordinated, lethargic behavior and seizures in mice, and have been associated with epilepsy in humans. Ongoing research in Dr Garrity's and Dr Horne's laboratories will use a combination of molecular genetic and biochemical approaches to test potential roles for the beta subunit in interacting with cytoskeletal components or in cell division or differentiation. The proposed research in zebrafish is expected to define new cellular roles for the beta subunit family, which could extend to other cell types in different physiological contexts, and may lead to a better understanding of disease phenotypes in mice and humans. The research will also contribute to our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving epiboly.

The rapidly improving data sets and the generation of novel hypotheses in Deep Time paleoceanography have created the need for more general and flexible models that can test a wide variety of hypotheses. The model is an advection-diffusion-reaction type box-model for the simulation of marine biogeochemical cycles, with emphasis on developing a mechanistic representation of the nitrogen cycle. Ocean circulation is currently represented in a 1.5-D model with three zones; a stratified \"gyre\" zone, an \"upwelling\" zone, and a \"high latitude\" zone. The gyre and upwelling zones are constructed with 34 vertical levels, ranging from 50 m resolution near the surface to 400 m resolution in the abyssal ocean, to provide realistic vertical profiles of biogeochemically relevant components. The model is designed to simulate the major biogeochemical processes in the CNPOS system. We propose to improve the functionality of the model, particularly the representation of dissolved organic carbon and of benthic exchange processes. We will calibrate it against modern ocean chemical data sets for both biogeochemical function and appropriate water exchange coefficients. We will extend its capabilities to include the calculation of the stable isotope ratios of C, N and S, to enable predictions that are testable against the growing database of isotopic data from sedimentary archives.    We plan to test three types of hypotheses: 1) reduced O2 supply to the deep ocean results in enhanced N losses via denitrification and anammox, which are compensated to an unknown extent by increased N fixation. We will compute the expected d15N values for N-replete and N-limited cases and expect that they will yield resolvably different isotopic signatures that can be tested against the sedimentary record. 2) We will investigate the dynamics of a DOC-rich ocean proposed for the Neoproterozoic. We will simulate vertical gradients of P, H2S and d13C in such an ocean, and the time scales and fluxes necessary to eliminate this large proposed DOC reservoir in a non-steady state fashion. 3) We will perform a model-model comparison with the GENIE EMIC model applied to the Permo-Triassic. We will use the results of the GENIE simulation to initialize the fully coupled CNPOS system in our model, and test the response of the N system to proposed photic zone sulfide fluxes.    Scientific merit: The proposed model development will result in a powerful, yet easy to use tool for testing hypotheses about the function of ancient marine biogeochemical cycles. While model cannot prove a particular hypothesis, they can be very useful in understanding the dynamics of biogeochemical systems. In particular, workers in Deep Time have begun to pose sophisticated hypotheses about the function of ancient coupled biogeochemical cycles, and adequate models are necessary to explore the consequences of these ideas. We will be able to test a series of hypotheses posed by Deep Time workers and examine their predicted impact on the coupled CNPOS system. We will be able to make testable predictions, particularly focused on the response of the N system which has been so far relatively little investigated in Deep Time studies.     Broader impacts: We plan to follow an \"open source\" approach, and make the model and appropriate documentation available to the scientific community. The model structure is deliberately modular, to enable easy modification of biogeochemical functions without having to modify the core structure. We believe that the model can readily used by a variety of researchers, for whom the barriers to developing a similar model would be high. We also expect that model development and hypothesis testing can proceed most rapidly when a community, rather than an individual research group, can readily carry out both development and simulations."

The resulting electron density profiles will provide images of the bubble structures that are thought to cause the phenomena of radio frequency scintillations and equatorial spread-F.  The project will include algorithm development, data collection campaigns, and data analysis.  The algorithms to be developed will perform diffraction tomography calculations; the input data are received Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplitudes and phases from an array of receivers that are experiencing scintillations. The algorithms will estimate electron density profiles by developing and applying model estimation/inversion techniques to models such as a phase screen with Fresnel forward scattering. The estimation techniques will exploit the availability of dual-frequency GPS scintillation data that can be monitored because of new civilian GPS L2 signals now becoming available. They will also exploit the ability of GPS to make group-delay measurements; use of these data will follow development of a model predicting how group delay is affected by a disturbed ionosphere. The algorithms will be applied to data from two types of equatorial scintillation collection campaigns. One type of campaign will collect data using small arrays of wide-band digital storage receivers and MATLAB post-processing to acquire and track scintillating signals. The second type will use a medium sized array of real-time GPS software radio receivers. Some of the effort will go toward completing development of the latter type of receiver. Two distinctive features of this project are its use of  very robust receiver technology, which will enable collection of very accurate RF amplitude and phase data for very strong scintillations and its development of generalized estimation/inversion algorithms.  These algorithms that go beyond the capabilities of currently existing or proposed algorithms in their use of multi-frequency data, in their problem formulations, and in their algorithmic implementation based on optimization or fixed-point methods.   The project focuses on very strong scintillations since these are the most important from an operational standpoint since they have the biggest impact on communications and navigation signals.  The project's broader impacts include the development of instruments that can be used in education as well as in research and the improved communication and navigation system reliability that will result from an improved understanding of scintillations."

The last twenty years have witnessed the introduction and adoption of numerous architectural advances at the processor level, as computer architects have successfully translated increases in transistor budgets to performance. Unfortunately, effective hardware policies for managing and controlling these complex artifacts have not advanced commensurately. Most policies are ad hoc at best, and generally incapable of providing important functionalities like anticipating the long-term consequences of  decisions (planning), or generalizing from experience obtained through decisions executed in the past to act successfully in new situations (learning).    At the same time, the artificial intelligence and machine learning communities have made tremendous strides in designing computer programs and algorithms that learn about their environment and improve automatically with experience. The proposed inter-disciplinary work will develop methodologies based on such a technology to design efficient, adaptable, and self-optimizing on-chip hardware policies. The project will concentrate on chip multiprocessors, in which opportunities for hardware management promise to be numerous and challenging. If successful, this approach may set off a change in the way computer architects think about and conduct research on computer architecture design.    The project will apply machine learning technology in two ways: (1) tools for the systematic design of optimized management policies that can then be installed in hardware (e.g., ROM-based circuits); and (2) self-optimizing hardware agents that implement efficient policies, can learn from their environment, and improve automatically with experience."

This project integrates experimental and longitudinal approaches to examine cultural and individual mechanisms underlying autobiographical memory development in middle childhood. This age period, while generally neglected in the field of memory research, is critical for the development of advanced autobiographical memory skills for detailed, well-structured, and accurate remembering. Children and their mothers from European American families, Chinese families in China, and first-generation Chinese immigrant families in the U.S. will participate. Three home interviews will be arranged for each child between 6 and 8 years of age, where children's developing autobiographical memory will be assessed in relation to their narrative skills, self-concept, metamemory, temporal concepts, and cultural knowledge. Mothers' cultural beliefs will be assessed through surveys. A staged event will be conducted at the first interview and children's memory of the event will be assessed for content, amount, and accuracy at later time points. To delineate the contribution of parental reminiscing behavior to children's memory, experimentally planned mother-child reminiscing will take place between the first two interviews, with mothers in the experimental group being trained to share memories with their children in an elaborative style.    The project will make a unique contribution to current theories by examining both individual and cultural parameters on memory development. It will further provide new insights into the multi-faceted processes and outcomes of children's developing autobiographical memory skills, and fill in the theoretical and empirical gap concerning autobiographical memory development in middle childhood. Because autobiographical memory is constructed through the child's knowledge of the world and of the self and the memory, in turn, constitutes the child's identity, personality, and psychological well-being, the findings will have the potential to inform research and clinical practices regarding issues that emerge during middle childhood, such as eating disorders and depression. Furthermore, situated in a cross-cultural context, the findings will inform parenting, educational practices, and real life settings in contemporary American society where there are an increasing number of immigrant populations, as well as in the current global context that calls for intercultural exchanges and understanding."

The researchers propose a two-way interaction between language and cognition from a very early stage in development.  This project will focus on the domain of the spatial relation of support (e.g., placing a target object on a table).  Infants already explore many aspects of support relations well before language begins and yet languages divide up these relations in significantly different ways.  To understand the relation between language and cognition, the researchers propose to uncover infants' nonverbal abilities to form abstract categories of support relations (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical support, support by attachment), and how such abilities interact with the language they hear in acquiring the meaning of the spatial words in their language.  The researchers take a multi-language and multi-method approach to investigate this interaction.  Specifically, they examine the development of nonlinguistic and semantic categories of support relations in children learning English, Korean, German, or Spanish, language groups that contrast interestingly in how they organize various support relations in their language.     In examining the effect of environmental inputs on children's spatial cognition, the studies compare (across the four language groups) linguistic and  gestural aspects of maternal speech when they talk about support events (putting x on y) to their children.  For this goal, for each language, the researchers will conduct a longitudinal study following parent-child interactions in a naturalistic setting (i.e., the child's home) starting from 10 months (child's age) for a year and half will also be conducted.  A cross-sectional, elicitation study to compare cross-cultural differences in parental talking is also planned.  To understand how infants and toddlers organize and categorize various types of support relations, the researchers also will conduct experimental studies to systematically investigate the development in infants' organization of spatial categories. By examining several age groups from the preverbal period to early childhood (from 10 to 27 months of age), the studies will document how the nonlinguistic categories of support formed in infancy may be influenced by the acquisition of the spatial terms of support in their language.   To best assess the interaction between infants' abilities and their environment, the investigation combines several methodologies in an integrative way, including naturalistic, longitudinal methods, cross-sectional elicitations methods, and experimental cross-sectional approaches.     The two co-PIs have yielded cross-cultural findings on the development of spatial cognition and spatial language in English- and Korean-learning children that have contributed to a recent rethinking of the early relationship between language and cognition.  In the proposed project, they add a new dimension to their investigation by addressing the role of parents' input in the development of spatial cognition and by pinpointing the linguistic elements that drive infants' categorization of support into the language-specific semantic categories.  Overall, the proposed study will contribute to understanding more precisely the nature of the interaction between language and cognition in early childhood.    The international collaboration among the researchers in this project lends a unique methodological approach to the research questions and provides a wide range of training opportunities for the researchers and their students. Because of the cross-linguistic nature of the project, they plan to recruit and train students from underrepresented minorities to assist with various aspects of the project. The results from the project also will contribute much needed data from infants and toddlers underrepresented in developmental research. The results will be disseminated broadly, in academic (including international outlets) and non-academic settings (via workshops and presentations to teachers, parents, and daycare workers)."

In opposition to this, the past half-century has seen a resurgence of continuous and dynamical approaches to the mind, arguing for a smooth transition from cognitive into motor subsystems. This predicts that the dynamic characteristics of observable action will directly reflect underlying thought processes. In support of this, much recent research has shown that continuous tracking of motor movement can provide rich information about the mental processing giving rise to it.     With support of the National Science Foundation, Drs. Rick Dale and Michael Spivey will explore how action dynamics can shed light on human learning. By tracking computer-mouse trajectories, Dale and Spivey aim to uncover how action dynamics evolve as people learn. Several multi-choice, computer-based experiments will employ tasks of varying complexity, from simple associative learning (e.g., pairing symbols) to acquiring knowledge from text. Such measures would supplement traditional performance variables based on discrete answers. These studies can also provide a further understanding of the intimate connection between thought and action. In addition, the work can provide insights about how best to adapt computer systems for education: Through automatic analysis of computer-mouse movements, these adapted systems could detect such states as lack of learner confidence or deep understanding, and could appropriately respond to these potential deficits in real time, and thereby enhance learning."

With cigar-shaped cells reaching 600 �m x 80 �m, Epulopiscium spp. are the largest heterotrophic bacteria described to date.  Despite its size, Epulopiscium is able to support a high level of activity.  The presence of large amounts of repetitive DNA located at the periphery of the cytoplasm and a highly invaginated cell membrane may be significant adaptations to maintain large cell size in Epulopiscium.  The amplification and distribution of genomic resources help support a robust metabolism while expansion of the cell membrane and membrane associate transporters may enhance exchange with the environment and facilitate movement of molecules within the cytoplasm.  In this project Dr. Angert and her colleagues seek to further characterize these features and determine 1) the timing and location of DNA replication in the cell, 2) how multiple chromosomes with differing fates are positioned and managed and 3) the impact of intracellular membranes on molecular diffusion.  Continued efforts toward culturing Epulopiscium spp. are planned.  Maintaining Epulopiscium outside of its host will allow for in vivo experiments and ultimately the development of genetic tools.     Broader Impacts: These projects provide significant educational and training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students interested in the sciences.  All students will gain experience in basic molecular biology, microbiology and microscopic techniques.  Depending on the project, students will gain more extensive experience in areas such as genomics, microscopy, phylogenetic analyses or nanobiotechnology, to name a few.  Such laboratory research experience is essential to the development of a young scientist.     Epulopiscium provides an exciting model for conveying basic concepts of the bacterial cell.  These cells are visually appealing and can be seen with the unaided eye.  The fact that Epulopiscium spp. are so large, but not pathogenic, makes them a good representative of the microbial world not only for biology students but for the general public as well.  To facilitate information flow, a website featuring Epulopiscium has been established. Students at all levels are involved in the development and maintenance of the site.  This project instills in students the responsibility of all researchers to disseminate information to the public and it will enhance the ability of the students to communicate their work and its significance to a diverse audience.

Academic scholars, as well as national and international bodies such as the President's Council on Bioethics, UNESCO, and the Council of Europe, maintain that these scientific and technological practices pose a threat to human dignity. Unfortunately, in these debates the concept is ill-defined and thus it is unclear how these biotechnologies offend human dignity. It often is used in ways that obscure the problems at stake and thus prevent meaningful dialogue. Indeed some have argued that in biotechnology discussions the concept is so vague as to be useless and that therefore it should be discarded. Rather than abandon appeals to human dignity, this research proposes to critically evaluate such appeals. In order to analyze current appeals to human dignity, the PI will conduct a review of scholarly work, as well as of national and international science policy documents that use human dignity as grounds for rejecting genetic enhancement, the creation of human-nonhuman chimeras, and embryonic stem cell research. This evaluation will elucidate three different issues. First, the PI will try to identify and clearly articulate the particular conception of human dignity that is implicit or, more rarely, explicit in several academic and policy documents. Second, the research will evaluate whether human dignity is understood in the same way when referring to these different scientific and technological practices. That is, the research will clarify whether the creation of human-nonhuman chimeras is thought to threaten human dignity in the same way as genetic enhancement or stem cell research. Third, the project will determine whether it is the case that, given the conception or conceptions of human dignity endorsed, these scientific and technological practices pose a threat to our human dignity. That is, the research will elucidate whether those making these appeals correctly understand current biological knowledge. The project will provide the first systematic assessment of what several influential scholars and recent national and international science policy documents mean when they say that genetic enhancement, the creation of human-nonhuman chimeras, and stem cell research threaten human dignity. A focus on understanding both the concept of human dignity and the particular scientific and technological practices that are thought to challenge such dignity can help reframe current debates on the impact of biotechnology.  The research will make a significant contribution to current debates in science and values, in bioethics, and in science policy. First, given the increasing appeals to human dignity as a justification for constraining biotechnological development, this analysis can determine whether, and under what conditions, the concept of human dignity can properly be used as a criterion for science policy. Second, by evaluating the relationships between biological knowledge and its consequences for human dignity, this analysis calls attention to the importance of understanding such knowledge when evaluating the presumed implications of biology for ethics and public policy. Third, assessing the ethical and public policy implications of current biotechnological work can help eliminate misunderstandings and build consensus. Thus, the research can play a role in improving dialogue between the sciences and the humanities, and between the sciences and society. The results of this research will be disseminated through presentations at professional conferences, public speaking engagements, publication of journal articles, a draft of a book, and educational workshops directed to biomedical scientists."

Among these lakes, however, Lake Tanganyika is distinctive in the extent to which its other taxa have also diversified: over 350 unique non-cichlid species are found within this lake. Tanganyika is therefore a unique ecosystem for studying processes of endemic diversification: how is it that some taxa have diversified so dramatically within this single lake? One hypothesis is that substrate heterogeneity in the littoral zone allows taxa to ecologically specialize on specific substrates, and isolation between subpopulations in this heterogeneous environment creates the potential for speciation. Although this hypothesis for within-lake allopatric speciation was first proposed over 25 years ago, its role in creating patterns of species diversity within the East African rift lakes remains largely untested. If isolation of populations through substrate specificity and limited dispersal among habitat patches has driven diversification, it is hypothesized that species from groups with high endemic diversity will show evidence of restricted gene flow between populations. This research will investigate this hypothesis in two unrelated groups that have produced substantial endemic radiations in Lake Tanganyika: Lavigeria gastropods, and cichlid fishes of the tribe Tropheini. Study species of cichlid fishes and snails are all benthic herbivores restricted to rocky substrates. This obligate habitat association, coupled with their notably high lake-wide species diversity, suggests that ecological specialization on rocky substrate has promoted speciation in both snail and cichlid groups. Therefore, ecological specialization may drive parallel genetic subdivision of populations and diversification in multiple unrelated taxonomic groups. To test these hypotheses, both mitochondrial DNA sequence and microsatellite data will be used to analyze comparative patterns of population genetic structuring in cichlids and snails along the heterogeneous shoreline bordering Kigoma, Tanzania. Understanding the impact that ecological specialization has on gene flow dynamics and patterns of diversity across these taxa will allow the testing of important, long-standing questions about the processes of diversification among Lake Tanganyika's exceptionally diverse faunas."

A recent trend is to blur the boundary between game designers and game players, by allowing game players to modify the game and to give free range to their own expressiveness.  In modern games, players can extend or modify the game terrain, as well as the look and feel of the game characters.  The involvement of game players in the creative part of game design has also been extended to the most important part of the game, namely the behavior of the game as expressed through its non-player characters (NPCs).  Game players can alter the behavior of NPCs by modifying scripts that control them.  Unfortunately, this aspect of today's computer games still suffers from a severe limitation, in that there are either just a few highly sophisticated NPCs, or a large number of very simple NPCs.  The ultimate goal, of having the game scale to a large number of sophisticated NPCs, is not an option today.  In this research, the PI will try to address this limitation by seeking answers to questions such as the following.  What are suitable languages for scripting NPCs that are highly expressive yet permit sufficiently interesting character behavior?  What are suitable processing algorithms for games with a large number of NPCs?  How can designers fine-tune their games to balance performance with game-play?  To gain a better understanding of these issues, the PI will develop a novel language (complete with optimizing compiler) that is expressive, but which can be processed efficiently with multi-query optimization from the database literature.  And he will design tools for game designers to create expressive NPCs, which include techniques to allow the designers to easily adjust the quality of the simulation to improve performance.  Stratagues, an open-source game engine, will serve as the concrete testbed for the initial implementation of the PI's ideas; a second implementation in a new toolkit for fast creation of scalable simulations is also planned.  Finally, the PI will explore how his ideas relating to and lessons learned from games can be applied to simulations of virtual worlds beyond games, such as disaster recovery scenarios or simulation of animals and their environment.  The PI expects to convincingly demonstrate that ideas and technology developed initially for programming virtual worlds (i.e., simulations) relating to computer games, can benefit and have a huge impact on scientists who currently labor to write simulations in low-level programming languages.    Broader Impacts:  The outcomes of this research will empower scientists to quickly generate realistic simulations of scenarios involving large numbers of humans and/or animals while achieving performance comparable to that of specialized code requiring orders of magnitude more time to write.  To this end, the PI will distribute the software he creates in this project as open source, and will furthermore develop a toolkit for rapid-prototyping of scientific simulations of rescue and disaster recovery operations."

In conventional radio link, the small antenna size constrained by the overall system geometry will require high carrier frequency, but a lower limit of the power consumption will be set by the parasitic capacitance of the radio circuits.  There are several previous efforts to resolve this basic conflict, including an extended dormant mode, ultra-wide-band pulse systems, and the carrier-based impulse radio. However, either the physical antenna is difficult to realize, or the power can not be sufficiently reduced.  The proposed transmitter requires only a narrow-band antenna, but generates the carrier oscillation from a passive Bragg lattice.  The digital base band is operated at a low frequency close to the specified bit rate of communication, and can be readily implemented in the digital wrist watch fashion. The signal rise and fall time can be first sharpened by a buffer, and then be further sharpened with enlarged magnitude in nonlinear transmission lines. When the wave front contains a large signal with characteristic frequency exceeding the Bragg lattice frequency, single-tone oscillating waves are generated with high power conversion efficiency to drive the millimeter-size antenna.     Broader Impact:  Inexpensive millimeter-size autonomous systems have many important applications such as environmental monitoring, body implants for disease screening and detection with minimal intrusion, the creation of intelligent spaces, and structural health monitoring.  The key missing technology is the low-power wireless link.  The success of this research effort will bring forth major impacts on senor network and biomedical implants.  The miniature autonomous system design will also serve as the main example for outreach to high-school female and minority students to boost their aptitude towards engineering as a socially relevant career direction."

The languages with the most elaborated systems of clicks are currently endangered, so our chances of understanding the range of these sounds that human languages can accommodate are dwindling.  With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Amanda Miller (Cornell University) and Dr. Bonnie Sands (Northern Arizona University) will analyze the physical properties of these complex sounds. A newly-developed ultrasound imaging methodology will greatly enhance our knowledge of the movements of the tongue during these consonants. Current phonetic thinking, as seen in the International Phonetic Alphabet, encompasses five clicks (bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal and lateral), but preliminary work has revealed that there are an additional three click types: retroflex, palatoalveolar lateral, and forward-released (or denti-alveolar) lateral.  A completely new class of sounds, linguopulmonic consonants, that seem to entail a phonological airstream contour, has also been tentatively identified. The researchers, with assistance from Laurentius Davids of the National Institute for Educational Development in Namibia and Dr. Kemmonye Monaka of the University of Botswana, will study the kinematics of unrecognized clicks and new types of consonants and compare them with the known click types so that the articulatory, acoustic and phonological properties of all clicks will be better understood. Research will focus on 5 click languages: Ekoka !Xung, Grootfontein !Xung, Ju|''hoansi, =/Hoan, and Mangetti Dune !Xung.     Marginal and complex sounds found in African languages must fit into universal models of human language, but they have often been neglected given that existing models have typically been built around European languages and a select range of others. The present research will also aid the development of orthographies for the languages under study. The project will result in an audio and video database of Khoesan language speech acoustics and production that will be transcribed, annotated, placed in a public archive and made available to interested researchers. This database will be a unique source of information on synchronic and diachronic phonological patterns involving clicks (particularly those patterns between vowels made towards the front of the mouth and clicks which involve retraction of the tongue). The description of the physical properties (phonetic) and mental representations (phonology) of unrecognized consonants resulting from this research will allow these rare consonants to shape universal linguistic theories beyond the life of the currently threatened languages."

Because lubricants are devoid of regular atomic scale structure and form layers that are very thin, atomic scale relaxations and flows have been difficult to investigate using standard characterization techniques. Recently however, it has been shown that colloidal suspensions comprised of micron sized spheres suspended in a solvent exhibit many of the hallmark features characteristic of molecular systems including the formation of gaseous, liquid, and crystalline phases. This allows for using such suspensions as model systems for investigating atomic scale lubrication phenomena. Investigating lubrication in colloidal suspensions offers unique advantages. For example, in addition to measuring the friction forces, the 3D positions and motions of the particles can be determined using confocal microscopy and computational particle tracking techniques. This can be done even while the suspension is sheared. In addition photolithography machines such as those available at the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility can be used to pattern surfaces with which the suspension is in contact. This allows for modeling the effects of different surface structures on lubricating flows.  This project will take advantage of these capabilities to directly investigate why lubricating films become much more viscous and difficult to shear when there are fewer than 10 layers of particles between the surfaces, how microscopic events collude to produce stick slip motion in thin lubricating films, and the role of surface roughness at different length scales. From a broader prospective the research should lead to new as of yet unaddressed phenomena that have relevance for the industrial handling and fabrication of thin films and coatings. This project makes extensive use of a variety of experimental techniques that include particle synthesis, photolithography, confocal microscopy, and the development of tracking and analysis algorithms. Therefore, graduate students will be exposed to a range of techniques and will be well prepared for future careers in multidisciplinary science. In addition semiannual New York Complex Matter Workshops will be organized. These meetings will stimulate interaction among soft matter and statistical physics researchers from Syracuse, Cornell, RIT, General Electric, Kodak, Corning and other institutions and industrial labs in the area. The workshops will serve as an excellent opportunity for sharing results from this and other research projects and introducing graduate students and post docs to the local academic and industrial research community."

Experimental testing along side computational and mathematical modeling will be used to achieve the desired understanding.  From aluminum foil to airplane wings, most metallic components used today are formed from flat pieces. As in current commercial practice, mechanical rolling and thermal annealing stages have high energy, environmental and capital costs. The goal is to develop processes to solidify raw material directly into final product, without downstream processing steps. This is a vision that goes back to Bessemer (1865) and its realization would revolutionize thin-sheet manufacturing.  The casting method forces molten metal into contact with a spinning cold wheel where the metal solidifies and is spun off.  Manipulation of the contacting and solidification events is the focus.    As compared to current practice, there would be direct energy savings for single-step casting.  Indirect benefits include the reduction of greenhouse gases, particularly, carbon dioxide. Capital costs for manufacturing would be reduced and productivity would be increased. Both environment and industry benefit.  As China and India industrialize and the demand for flat products grows, these benefits to society will accrue.  A further benefit will be through education. Undergraduates and graduates will be involved in this research as a problem-solving team, with educational outreach to local schools."

The rationale for this argument is derived, in part, from a similarity-attraction paradigm, which posits that people find it validating to interact with others who share similar attitudes and values.  Demographic characteristics are often used as an index of attitudinal similarity; thus, individuals are likely to select others who are demographically similar when given a choice of partners. However, different empirical studies have linked demographic similarity to favorable, neutral and unfavorable evaluations, and to both positive and negative hiring decisions. This suggests that a similarity-attraction paradigm may hold true in some situations but not all, and raises the provocative possibility that those who may appear to be most likely to have a positive impact on organizational diversity and inclusion may choose to undermine this outcome or at the very least abdicate the opportunity to facilitate it.   This project combines theoretical work on social group identification processes with findings from research on group demography to understand the conditions that affect the likelihood that individuals in groups in which they are numerical minorities will prefer similar to dissimilar others (and vice versa) and thus serve as advocates for their inclusion as new group members. The co-PI will use experimental design to study the interactive effects of group demography and candidates' relative competence on low-status subjects' support for adding similar others to the group.    The research advances the macro- and micro-sociological insights on inter- and intra-group relations by studying how psychological processes related to self-categorization are affected by the combined influences of social status and tokenism. This integration of theories is an important step in gaining a more complete understanding of intra-group relationships in situations in which enduring status differences between groups create negative or ambivalent feelings in mobile members of low-status groups about their group identity.  Research findings will yield information that could inform policies aimed at reducing social inequality, in particular, barriers to the advancement of women and minorities in organizations, and therefore, could inform social and organizational policies that may help to overcome these barriers."

Wireless networks, owing to the unprotected communication medium, are vulnerable to unauthorized access of networking information. For example, by merely observing transmission times of packets, a passive eavesdropper can decipher source-destination pairs and paths of data flow in a network. Unauthorized retrieval of such information, known as traffic analysis, is a violation of user privacy. It also provides crucial information for the jamming of network traffic and launching of a denial-of-service attack.    This research aims to establish an analytical framework for achieving anonymity in wireless networks. The key objectives are to establish a theoretical framework upon which provably anonymous and secure protocols for multiple access communication and anonymous networking can be developed and analyzed. Drawing ideas of anonymous mixing from Internet privacy, timing channel analysis from information theory, and intrusion detection from statistical inference of point processes, countermeasures against passive and active means of compromising anonymity are investigated.  Parallel to the well known rate-secrecy trade-off in point-to-point communications, fundamental tradeoffs between anonymity and network performance metrics, such as throughput and delay, are investigated. Scheduling and routing protocols are developed to prevent unauthorized release of networking information to passive and active adversaries."

One of the main challenges faced by computer science today is to successfully build and manage systems used by such diverse set of users. The future of much of the complex technology developed today depends on our ability to ensure that participants cooperate despite their diverse goals and interests.     The project uses the tools of game theory for studying the behavior of such a diverse, competing and cooperating set of users in networks modeling the interaction between parts of information and computer systems controlled by different parties. Each participant in an algorithm is viewed as a player in a non-cooperative game, where each player acts to selfishly optimize his or her own objective function. The research approaches some of the traditional algorithmic questions in networks from the perspective of game theory ranging from how networks are formed by cooperating selfish users, how such networks are used to disseminate information, how economies work on such networks. In each case the main issue considered by this project is the quality loss due to selfish behavior of the participants.

The research aims for a more complete understanding of the capabilities and limitations of network coding in structurally complex networks, to be achieved using tools from the theory of algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and computational complexity.      The research delineates a role for the theory of algorithms and combinatorial optimization within the study of network coding, incorporating core notions such as approximation algorithms and primal-dual techniques.  Exact algorithms for computing the achievable rate region are sought in special classes of network coding problems, most notably for multiple unicast sessions in undirected graphs. Approximation algorithms are sought for general graphs; it is likely that non-trivial approximation algorithms will highlight purely structural features of network coding problems ( e.g. succinct certificates of infeasibility) which will spur further progress in the area.

Tests with statistical mixed effect models will take advantage of the large number of independent sites, which have widely varying environmental conditions along a gradient spanning Alaska through the equator to Tierra del Fuego. Collaboratively designed and implemented experiments will be used to examine the strongest associations and distinguish between mechanistic/ecological and adaptive/historical interpretations, including (but not limited to) manipulations of nest-cup temperature and brood-size. Analysis will be strengthened by the use of existing robust phylogeny for these birds, and the applications of technology developed by the PIs in this system (portable digital candlers, thermal data loggers, standardized sampling of insect prey, etc.).  	This project is providing international field and laboratory research experience to a large number of US undergraduate and graduate students from diverse cultural backgrounds, and promoting collaborations among foreign investigators and students and engender continued research initiatives. A cadre of dedicated bilingual US undergrad Interns are being recruited and trained in field methods while they work in collaborative quartets composed of a more experienced US student and two host- country counterparts. In addition to testing core hypotheses, these teams gather data crucial to understanding the effects of climate change on birds and their insect prey.   	Workshops at every active training site as well as round-tables, workshops and symposia at national and international meetings will be open to all interested biologists, regardless of taxonomic interest, thus expanding the intellectual scope of the project. Golondrinas sites will serve as an entry point for comparative biologists wishing to study other taxa throughout the Americas. All the project's activities and findings will be disseminated through the well-developed web and public outreach activities and infrastructure of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.   	This project addresses fundamental ecological questions that, because of their scale, require testing via a broad network of international researchers. Through these interactions, it creates a sustainable and synergistic research collaboration among biologists from many nations and trains large numbers of US and foreign students for leadership in future collaborative scientific endeavors.This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) with co-funding from the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB)."

While the physical mechanism by which a single bacterium swims, pushing itself through the fluid with a flagella bundle that turns like a screw, is well understood, the equations of motion governing a suspension of bacteria have not been derived previously. In the proposed study, we will derive these equations starting from a fundamental description of bacteria-fluid interactions, solve the equations for several representative flows, and observe these flows experimentally.     Intellectual Merit: A bacteria cell exerts a drag force on the fluid while its flagella exert an equal and opposite force, leading to a force dipole which on average creates a pressure in the direction of mean cell orientation. This situation may be contrasted with a stretched polymer which exerts a tension in the direction of its orientation. In a weak shear flow, a bacterium orients with the extensional axis of the flow and reinforces the extensional motion. Thus, above a critical cell concentration, the suspension has a negative viscosity and a quiescent suspension will be unstable to the formation of spontaneous fluid motion. We believe that this instability explains previous experimental observations of vortical motions in systems of swimming bacteria. We plan to use particle tracking of both bacteria and passive colloidal particles to probe this instability.     The alignment of bacteria along streamlines in a strong shear flow will create a negative first normal stress difference (or streamline pressure) in contrast to the positive first normal stress difference (or streamline tension) for polymer solutions. Both non-Newtonian fluids can enhance mixing due to secondary flows caused by streamline curvature in a curved microfluidic channel, but, as we shall confirm, the vortices will be centered on the inside of a channel bend for bacteria and on the outside for a polymer solution.     Broader Impacts: The applications of our studies include a novel method to separate bacteria based on their chemotactic behavior, a new ?active? fluid for micro-fluidic mixing whose activity can be modulated by biochemical inputs, and insights into the manner in which cells disperse or collect themselves into clusters as they respond to biochemical cues. People have a natural curiosity about the collective behavior of living things. Our studies which link such collective behaviors to the principles of momentum and mass transport and kinetic theory descriptions of suspensions will provide a means to engage and inspire students to think about connections between biology and engineering. We will exploit these opportunities in our undergraduate and graduate curricula and in the Nanobiotechnology Center's outreach program for high school teachers."

The work will combine laboratory studies with field biomass sampling.

Heterogeneous datasets (genomics, chemical levels, dehalorespiration rates, populations) will be collected and incorporated into systems biology algorithms to generate gene network models. In the second phase, field biomass will be collected at bioaugmented sites to compare gene expression profiles of field-deployed DHC with those predicted from lab-derived models. In the final phase, genes highly correlated with dehalorespiration types and rates will be selected as bioindicators. Two types of bioindicator assays will be developed for field application?quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR) and dipstick-style RNA-biosensors.

However, little is known about using this data effectively and efficiently within their decision-making processes, which can often be modeled as multi-stage stochastic optimization problems.  In many application domains, such as supply chain management and revenue management, these give rise to complex problems, where the decision in each stage must be made under uncertainty about the future evolution of an underlying stochastic process.  Traditional approaches to these problems assume that the uncertainty is defined through explicitly specified probability distributions that are known a priori; the knowledge of these distributions is crucial to the development of the corresponding optimization algorithms. However, in most practical situations the exact distributions are not known, and only historical data is available.  This research project aims to develop a general-purpose sampling-based algorithmic framework for these models that, unlike traditional approaches, uses the raw historical data as the source of samples. First, we plan to develop sampling-based algorithmic approaches to approximately solve complex stochastic dynamic programming formulations, the dominant paradigm used for these problems.  Second, we focus on sampling-based algorithms for models that combine optimization and learning simultaneously.  A common theme between these two research thrusts, and a central feature of our research project, is the development of explicit quantitative analysis of the performance of our algorithms that provide guarantees on the sample-size needed to assure a specified error bound with respect to optimal solution for the true underlying probability distribution.    Consider a firm like Amazon that provides millions of different items to customers throughout the US. Clearly, it is important for the company to have the inventory that its customers want, since if an item is out of stock, then the customer is likely to purchase the item from elsewhere. On the other hand, maintaining extra inventory for undesired items has the disadvantage of tying up capital in obtaining them, using significant resources in warehousing this supply, which is further compounded by the risk of perishability and obsolesce.  If one had a crystal ball with which one could predict the future, then the company could know how many requests there will be, day by day, for each of the items it sells, and therefore know how much of what should be on hand in each of its warehouses. Instead, one can model the future probabilistically (similar to what a weather forecaster does when saying that there is a 40% chance of showers tomorrow), and then one can cast the problem of making the optimal decisions for these inventory levels as a problem of maximizing the average profit that can be obtained (or minimizing the average costs incurred), where the notion of average is with respect to the randomness used to model our inability to exactly predict the future. This project has the goal of using past historical data as a means for modeling the predictions for future data, and then designing algorithms that produce provably near-optimal decisions based on this approximation.  This type of decision-making in the face of uncertainty arises in a wide range of application domains, from selling different classes of airline  tickets for a portfolio of flight legs to manufacturing a suite of products that rely on overlapping sets of components. This project focuses on settings in which there are multiple stages of decision-making that must be made in the face of an evolving view of the predictions of future  requirements. The aim is to provide tools to automate such decision-making with algorithms that are guaranteed to quickly produce reliable solutions."

BirdSleuth is well suited as a pilot project for developing online teacher support because it is designed to engage students in authentic scientific research: making observations, collecting data, asking their own questions, drawing conclusions through research and observation, and publishing their results. This project  endeavors  to create effective and efficient techniques for scaffolding teachers as they use BirdSleuth to guide students through the various stages of designing, conducting, analyzing, and presenting the results of scientific experiments. Project findings provide the basis for a sustainable set of online resources to serve the needs of BirdSleuth teachers nationwide.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Given the major developments in scientific research in  polymers and the simultaneous evolution of the polymer industry in the 10 years  following the last NSF Workshop on Interdisciplinary Macromolecular Science and  Engineering, it is essential and timely that a new workshop be held now to identify and   update specific science and engineering research opportunities and strategies.  At the same   time, reflecting the increasing globalization of science and technology, it is essential to  examine the polymer field under this light and to identify opportunities and challenges in   terms of education and international competitiveness.  For this purpose, a two-day  workshop will be held at NSF headquarters with the participation of leading scientists,  engineers, and educators from academia, industry, and national laboratories.  This  workshop is to tbe organized by a committee of six individuals representing very broad  academic and industiral perspectives and having expertise across the polymer field and its  interfaces with areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and  exngineering.  The following six topics have been identified for study and discussion  among the workshop participants:  (1) Polymer synthesis and new polymeric materials,  (2) Design and manipulation of complex polymer systems, (3) Computational modeling  and theory, (4) Processing and assembly, (5) Characterizatin and properties, and (6)  Polymer technology in the service of society.  Education and competitiveness will be  woven into each of these themes and throughout the workshop.  In addition to the six  subgroups fo 6 to 10 particpants to discuss each of the above topics, the workshop will  begin with seven plenary speakers on issues of major importance and timeliness.  These  will include hiearchical functional materials, polumers in biology and medicine, energy  production and storage, environmental and sustainability, cyberscience and polymers, and   global security.    BROADER IMPACTS:  Emphasis on educaton and international competitiveness will  be given throughout the workshop and will also be the subject of a panel discussion on   the first day.  The workshop will create a web site that will be used as a tool to solicit  input and suggestions on these topics from the polymer community and to provide  information about workshop organization, schedule, and (evenutally) conclusions.  Participants in the workshop will reflect a wide diversity and include leading senior and   junior academic researchers, polyer educators, members of industry and government  laboraties to ensure that the conclustions of this workshop are broadly applicable across  polymer research and education.  A few selected graduate students (to be included as  assistants) will also benefit from this unique experience.  Following the workshop, the   organizing committee will report to NSF on the recommendations fo the entire group, and  will subsequently publish a final report.  The report will address key new research and  education directions, as well as the changing industrial needs and global context of  polymer research.  The resulting report will be broadly disseminated through publication  in print and on the Internet and is expected to influence the global polymer science and   engineering community.  Major interest for this workshop has been expressed by many  other Federal Agencies, which are expected to participate and co-sponsor it."

Information technology is pervasive throughout this process. Before beginning the laboratory work, computation is necessary for planning the experiment, and for later analysis of the results.  In gene chip experiments for determining gene activity levels, planning issues include which biological hypotheses should be considered and what chemical conditions will yield the most informative results, followed by computation to reduce the collected data, which can be gigabytes of information, to forms that can be understood and exploited by biological scientists.  In electron microscope experiments for determining the 3-D structure of viruses, planning issues include electron energy, defocus level, beam current, number of tilts, and tilt angles, followed by computation to reduce the measured data, which can be one hundred thousand or more images, to a biologically-plausible 3-D structure.  Historically, insufficient attention has been devoted to the use of highly sophisticated information technology for quantitative planning and analysis of experiments, which jointly takes into account the behavior of the measurement apparatus, the goals of the experiment, the unavoidable uncertainty in the system, and the algorithmic complexity that a particular experimental design implies for the subsequent computational analysis of the experimental data.  The research objective of this ITR project is to bring together a team of investigators from MIT, Purdue and NYU-Courant along with their industrial collaborators to apply principles from information, coding and systems theory, along with advanced computational methods for statistical inference and numerical optimization, to create a unified approach to planning and analysis of complex quantitative experiments in the biological sciences, such as the determination of gene expression using gene chips and the determination of 3-D viral structure from scattering and electron microscopy experiments. These biological problems will challenge the state of the art in information technology and an important characteristic of the project is the parallel development of new information technology and new biological applications. The human-resources objectives of this ITR project are to provide the opportunity for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates to learn about and contribute to this exciting area at the interface between information technology and biological sciences.

The primary science focus is high latitude E region plasma instabilities which will be studied through observations of the radar echoes observed by CUPRI.  The origin of the echoes remains a subject of debate; until recently, the irregularities were believed to be created during intense energetic particle precipitation.  However, two new mechanisms have been proposed.  The first involves the generation of instabilities by the steep plasma density gradients associated with storm-enhanced density (SED) structures.  The SED features have been observed from the tropics to well beyond the plasmapause.  Given the right electric field conditions, the SEDs may cause the plasma to go unstable, creating the small-scale structures required to enhance radar backscatter.  Alternatively, there may be a second mechanism responsible for driving plasma instabilities:  a temperature gradient instability that has been observed to produce HF scattering over the SuperDARN radar at Wallops Island.  These space weather events can result in degraded communication and navigation systems as the primary instabilities cascade to smaller scale lengths, producing scatter with consequential multi-path interference.  In addition to investigating the origin of the perturbed echoes, the project will explore three other science questions:  (1) do auroral events created by intense energetic particle precipitation, like those previously observed by CUPRI along the poleward edge of visible auroral arcs, relate to, or are they distinguished from, SED structures? (2) will images obtained by CUPRI be correlated with perturbations in total electron content during significant space weather events? (3) can more be learned about auroral plasma physics from measurements of magnetic aspect angles, as has been observed at Jicamarca Radar Observatory? (4) does the temperature gradient instability that causes some of the HF scattering observed over the SuperDARN radar at Wallops Island play a role in VHF scattering observed from Ithaca?  The planned upgrades to the CUPRI system include (1) deploying additional antennae and receivers to enable 3-D imaging of the echoes as well as measurements of the magnetic field aspect angle sensitivity of the echoes; (2) replacing analog receivers with digital receivers for improved quality control of the data from different antennae; (3) networking the data acquisition system to provide wide access, including student access, to real time and processed data products; and (4) creating a large networked database.  The broader impacts of the project include the provision of extensive hands-on experience in developing, deploying, operating, and maintaining modern radar equipment to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as opportunities in data acquisition, analysis and interpretation.  The host institution has demonstrated a strong commitment to including underrepresented groups in its research activity, particularly women and Hispanics, which is expected to continue under this project."

The size of those earthquakes is fundamentally related to the length of the rupture zone. The purpose of this project is to determine the long term average rupture length using suites of open tension cracks that are well exposed and preserved in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, the driest place on Earth. To accomplish this task, cracks formed by non-tectonic processes are differentiated from those produced by plate boundary earthquakes. A research team, headed by scientists from Cornell University and Miami University, with expertise in structural geology, arid soil formation, surface exposure dating, and geophysics are visiting key localities in northern Chile to develop objective criteria by which cracks of different origins can be distinguished. By dating different, but adjacent surfaces with different crack densities, the team is determining the rate of crack production, and by studying the isotopic composition of both moist soil along the cracks and gypsum veins formed within the cracks, the role of ground water in crack formation is being determined. Finally, radar interferometry provide images of cracks that open during actual earthquakes affecting the forearc. With objective criteria in hand, crack populations identified on 2 meter resolution imagery throughout northern Chile and southern Peru are evaluated to determine which ones were formed or have been reactivated by large plate boundary earthquakes. The orientations of those cracks can be related to earthquake rupture areas by modeling the static and dynamic stresses associated with both hypothetical and real plate boundary ruptures. The major scientific outcome of this work will be the first long term evaluation of the concept of characteristic earthquakes that spans thousands to tens of thousands of events, rather than the few events that are possible to resolve with paleoseismological techniques.    This work will lead directly to an assessment of the long term, time average nature of great earthquakes that affect northern Chile and southern Peru. By inverting the crack orientation for the average slip distribution, the work can help disaster response planners to predict what areas are likely to be most affected by major earthquakes. This information is immediately pertinent to the cities of Iquique and Arica (each involving hundreds of thousands of people) which have not experienced a major earthquake since the late 1800's. With a repeat time of 100 to 150 years, this segment is currently the most dangerous part of the entire South American margin. Previous earthquakes along the Chile margin have produce tsunamis that have caused damage all around the Pacific margin. For example, the tsunami from the 1960 Chile earthquake destroyed the town of Hilo on the big island of Hawaii. Knowing the average slip distribution for the Iquique Arica segment will help build more accurate models of tsunami generation in those areas.

Topics from genetics include regulatory sequence evolution, gene duplication, and the analysis of data generated by cancer genome projects. In finance, understanding bubbles in markets, swing options, and credit risk associated with subprime mortgages require sophisticated mathematical ideas from control theory, backward stochastic differential equations, and enlargement of filtration. The study of financial markets, insurance risk, and communication and computer networks lead to stochastic models that exhibit long range dependence and heavy tails. The analysis of these processes and the new phenomena they present, involves techniques much different from the classical theory of independent random variables, making use of ideas from a wide variety of sources including ergodic theory. In addition, there is a fertile interaction between probability and a variety of topics that arise from algebra, geometry, and analysis, including the use of analytic techniques to study convergence rates of Markov chains.    Probability theory, born in the analysis of gambling games, now plays an important role in biology, physics, economics, finance, insurance, communication networks, and in many topics within mathematics. The main aim of this proposal is to train more researchers in probability to tackle the many important problems that arise from its applications. Cornell is an ideal place for these activities because of the strong traditions of research in probability and interdisciplinary work in applied mathematics. Support for summer research projects will show undergraduates that probability is an interesting research area with many important applications. At the graduate level, increased fellowship support will enhance the training of our Ph.D. students. Postdoctoral positions will help new graduates expand their horizons, while hot topics conferences and annual summer schools will be a national resource for broadening the education of researchers (young and old). In all of these activities, the focus will be on developing theory to treat problems that arise from applications."

Our proposal, the Summer Mathematics Institute at Cornell (SMI), is aimed at underrepresented groups, but will be open to all talented students who do not have access to a full range of advanced mathematics courses at their undergraduate institutions. Each year we will run an eight-week summer program for 12-14 students. Students will take a rigorous course in algebra or real analysis, with the subjects alternating yearly to allow the possibility for some students to attend the program twice. We expect that most of the first time participants will be in between their junior and senior years, although we will also consider finishing sophomores who have already had a course in that year's topic. Students will also participate in a research project, working in groups of 3-5. While some students may do original research, we imagine that in most cases students will be engaged in the process of rediscovering results that have already been published.    To excel in a top tier research oriented doctoral program graduate students must negotiate the transition from undergraduate mathematics problem solving to engaging in the abstract reasoning required in graduate course work and learn to communicate mathematical ideas.  Failure to make this transition inhibits performance in both course and seminar work and is a serious obstacle to success in graduate studies. A thorough grounding in the core subjects of real analysis and algebra is essential for pure and applied mathematicians. Inadequate preparation significantly hinders entering and completing graduate school. This situation is particularly salient in the case of minority students, many of whom begin graduate study after coming from colleges with limited resources to teach advanced math courses. Indeed, we have seen students at Cornell experience this difficulty in both our pure and applied programs.  SMI will facilitate these students' transition to and success in graduate school by broadening their knowledge of mathematics, strengthening their understanding of basic concepts, enhancing their communications skills, and providing an experience of mathematical research and learning what to expect in a challenging doctoral program.  SMI participation will both improve students' chances of gaining admission at a top tier graduate program and their chances of success upon enrolling in graduate school. As we anticipate that perhaps 3-5 students in each class will attend SMI for two summers, we expect that over _ve years we will train approximately 55 students. Ultimately, SMI will help widen the talent pool from which American mathematics will draw."

These automata are specific kinds of computer programs that, when run, mimic the steps cognitive scientists think occur between the point at which people read or hear individual words and when they know what whole sentences mean.    In this project, the research team is constructing automata in which three factors, usually studied singly, are combined.  The first factor is the linguistic grammar, which characterizes what people know when they know a language.  The second is the control strategy, which determines the particular order in which comprehenders deploy this knowledge in time.  The third factor is the theory of memory for words and phrases.  The researchers expect these triply-endowed automata to match human performance in a variety of sentence types.  In addition, since automata can be mathematically altered to take into account alternative grammars, memories and control strategies, they can be used to gain insights that would not come easily from behavioral experiments with real people. For example, behavioral experiments with elderly adults might show the effects of reduced memory capacity on the sentence comprehension process.  However, using automata allows the researchers to selectively alter not only memory but also control and grammar, revealing the role of each in ways that human experiments could not.  Similarly, mathematically rendering the automaton's grammar more Spanish-like (as opposed to English-like), for example, could also yield a deeper understanding of how the three factors interact and, more broadly, how people understand one another."

The Arecibo Observatory has obtained surplus transmitters from a decommissioned Over the Horizon (OTH) radar facility in Maine, and has obtained funding from both the Office of Naval Research and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP).  This award supports the balance of the effort needed to construct the facility at the Observatory.  The HF Facility is essential for continuing progress toward the understanding of the interaction between a powerful HF radio wave and the ionospheric plasma and for making new discoveries in several aspects of aeronomy.  The facility will consist of an HF antenna system to feed the 300 m dish, HF transmitters with a building to house them, and a power transmission system.  None of the existing HF facilities in the world has Arecibo's combination of diagnostic capabilities and geophysical environment.  This includes the extraordinarily sensitive incoherent scatter radar at Arecibo, as well as a suite of supporting optical instrumentation, and a magnetic mid-latitude location with a quiet stable background ionosphere.  This unique combination is ideal to study the underlying physical processes of the interaction in full detail. Until its destruction in September 1998 by Hurricane Georges, the Arecibo HF facility was located to the northeast of the Observatory near the coast of Puerto Rico.  Since it is not possible to rebuild in that area due to policy changes in land use by the Puerto Rican Government, the most practical and least expensive solution is to construct a facility with new capabilities using the 300 meter main dish of the Observatory as a reflecting antenna.  The surplus transmitters from the OTH facility are in perfect condition and easy to operate.  They will be connected to feeds located near the center of the surface of the dish and transmit to a wire mesh sub-reflector (Cassegrain) located well below the platform.  This reflector then illuminates the main dish to make a high gain HF signal.  The combination will provide the power needed for a variety of experiments, including the production of artificial airglow and accelerated electrons at the higher frequency.  As in the past, the new facility will support PhD directed graduate and undergraduate research programs from many universities.  The investigators will add a new exhibit to the observatory's superb visitor facility, for promoting the understanding of aeronomy and the importance of ground-based observations for understanding our space and atmospheric environment.  HF studies at Arecibo tie together aeronomy, space physics, plasma physics and education in a unique combination that allows for an effective implementation of NSF's strategic plan for enhancing diversity, making state of the art infrastructure available to the community, and providing opportunities to advance discovery and understanding of science and engineering."

It is a particularly important genetic process in flowering plants, and many cultivated plants (e.g., wheat, maize, cotton, soybean) are polyploid. Polyploidy can lead to profound genomic changes, even beyond duplicating all of the genes in the genome. Polyploidy has long been known to affect physiology, anatomy, and biochemistry, but few studies have sought to connect phenotype with changes at the molecular level to understand how plants achieve an integrated response to polyploidy in natural populations. Such investigations hold the key to understanding why polyploids are so prevalent among plants, and why polyploids often have been considered more adaptable or more successful than their diploid progenitors.  This project will study photoprotection - an important physiological process by which plants avoid damage from excess light energy - in several recently formed polyploid species of Glycine, the genus that includes the cultivated soybean. These species formed by hybridization and genome doubling (allopolyploidy) within the last 50,000 years. The diploid species that gave rise to them have been identified. Chlorophyll fluorescence assays will be used to compare photoprotection in the polyploid species with their diploid progenitors. At the molecular level, it will be determined how the gene copies contributed by the two diploid progenitors have changed in sequence and expression in the polyploidy species since their formation, and whether changes in DNA sequence, dosage, and/or expression patterns correlate with photoprotection phenotype.  Broader Impacts. This project is of broad significance and impact because it will elucidate the effects of a ubiquitous genetic phenomenon, polyploidy, on a physiological process essential to plant fitness, and will connect this to changes in the genes underlying photoprotection.

The study of well-defined plant cell-cell communication systems is important for elucidating developmental mechanisms as well as the processes that ensure reproductive success and determine evolutionary potential.  Genomic heterozygosity, or genetic variation, increases the ability of plants to adapt to changing environments.  It is no wonder therefore that plants have evolved a number of devices that promote out-crossing, thereby enhancing genetic variation and fitness.  One of these devices is self-incompatibility, a genetic mechanism that prevents self-fertilization.  In a field of mustards (belonging to the crucifer family), a large number of variants at the self-incompatibility (S) locus exist, resulting in extensive mixing of the gene pool and the generation of many new combinations of the genetic material.  Just as in our own ability to distinguish between hundreds of fragrances and odors, these plants use receptor and ligand proteins encoded in the S locus to distinguish self-related from non-self related (cross) pollen, allow development of cross pollen tubes, and inhibit that of self tubes.  This project aims to understand the molecular processes underpinning the out-crossing and selfing reproductive strategies in crucifers, using molecular genetic approaches in self-incompatible plants that were recently engineered in the normally self-fertile Arabidopsis thaliana model species.  Knowledge of the molecular genetic basis of these processes is critical for effective utilization of the germplasm available in a species for breeding crops tailored to particular environments.  More generally, the results are expected to help answer the key question of how organisms adapt by modifying their developmental programs to generate novel designs in structure and function.  The project also provides many opportunities to integrate teaching and research, and to train undergraduates, graduates, and post-doctoral fellows able to tackle the challenges of a rapidly changing world."

Longitudinal samples from individual tree swallows will be used to track oxidative stress, dysregulation of telomeres (chromosomal caps that protect coding DNA but shorten with cell division), and immune function decline. The extent to which individual variation in physiological mechanisms accounts for observed differences in survival and reproductive success will allow the researchers to identify the relative importance of these alternative pathways through which aging may occur. Samples from a cross-section of birds of different ages will identify how population averages for each physiological trait change with age, and comparison of the longitudinal and cross sectional samples will separate effects of individual aging from effects of selection between individuals with different trait values. The research will include an experiment designed to increase metabolic rates of individual swallows to test the hypothesis that oxidative metabolism and the attendant production of free radicals is causally important to the progression of aging and telomere shortening. It will provide laboratory and field training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as involvement by high school science teachers. This research will enable researchers interested in aging to link phenotypic trait values and risks of mortality, and identify evolutionarily important mechanisms of aging. In addition, this research will provide new tools to substantially strengthen the study of trade-offs in life history strategies."

IGALA is an international interdisciplinary organization committed to the promotion and support of research on the interactions of language with both gender and sexuality.  Presenters come from all over the world, and these meetings foster productive face-to-face conversations among people who might otherwise never even have had access to one another?s research and thinking.    Looking at how gender and sexual identities connect to sociolinguistic identities has already pushed scholars to examine more closely how social practice - the kinds of things people do as they talk with one another - figures in people's development of linguistic styles, in their evaluations of how others talk, and in what they think about how talk should proceed. What is especially critical for continuing progress is sustained exchange between scholars from different countries, working with different languages and different social and cultural settings. Talk and talk about talk is always a central component of social life and social change, never the whole story but always very significant. Understanding issues of gender and language - and especially the extraordinary range of situations across different cultural, social, and historical settings - is important for working for more equitable gender arrangements and relations as well as for more general insight into how language works in social life."

People engage in motivated reasoning whenever they bend their thinking about themselves and their social world toward conclusions they favor and away from those they do not. Such conclusions might be that one is a lovable and capable individual, or that one's future prospects are rosy ones, or that one's surrounding world presents only minimal risk or threat.  Motivated reasoning goes by many names -such as wishful thinking or rationalization- and has been shown to be prime contributor to unrealistic and overly optimistic conclusions that people reach about themselves and their prospects.  This proposal includes 13 laboratory experiments designed to assess how people engage in motivated reasoning without awareness of it. As such, it constitutes a new direction and extension of the PI's previous work on the psychological processes that underlie motivated reasoning, and potentially provides an answer as to why people often fail to recognize the distorted and overly optimistic nature of their beliefs. In particular, the proposal suggests that the processes underlying motivated reasoning \"hide\"  in three different \"locations\" that lie outside conscious awareness. As such, if people consciously monitor or review how they reach their conclusions, they will find little introspective trace of motivated distortion in their thinking. The research proposed here is designed to add to our theoretical knowledge by addressing how people can engage in wishful thinking and motivated distortion yet remain unaware that they are doing so."

Lyons, Univ. California, Riverside, EAR-0745602     Abstract   Atmospheric dust archives and drives climate change. Dust preserved in marine and continental sediments and ice has shed light on recent climate change, and dust also impacts climate via direct and indirect effects on the amount of solar energy received at Earth's surface, and by fertilization that stimulates primary productivity and thus the carbon cycle. However, the character and magnitude of the aerosol effect remains a poorly constrained variable in climate models, thus limiting the predictive capability of these models.   In this research, PIs propose to assess the 'dust effect' by investigating the geologic record of a particularly dusty interval on Earth. The late Paleozoic world, 300 million years ago, was remarkably dusty, with dust flux varying on both million-year and millennial scales. This time period is also attractive as the last time that Earth's climate was analogous to today's, with large polar ice sheets. Here, PIs propose to test the overarching hypothesis that the abundant dust played a significant role in driving changes in late Paleozoic climate and linked (e.g. biotic) systems, through direct, indirect, and feedback effects. They will investigate how dust flux, atmospheric circulation, and dust transport varied between glacials and interglacials, how dust forced changes in tropical climate, and how the biosphere responded to such high atmospheric dustiness. To address these questions, PIs are targeting two time slices in localities spanning the girth of the tropics. They will examine dust distribution, assess atmospheric dustiness and wind strength and direction, and use geochemistry to examine effects on marine life. They will correlate among localities using fossils and radioisotopic dating. PIs will use the data they collect as input for climate- and dust-modeling experiments, to assess the direct and indirect effects of dust on atmospheric behavior and undertake biogeochemical modeling aimed at assessing the impact of variable nutrient fluxes on cycling of carbon.   Intellectual Merit-- Results of this research will provide a high-resolution reconstruction of climate for the tropics and reveal the effects of dust on climate and life in a world characterized by variable dust flux on various timescales, within a 'glacial' world like today's. Owing to the known importance but remaining uncertainty of the roles of dust and associated aerosols in the climate system, our data will have predictive utility in expanding our understanding of Earth-system behavior across geologic time, and will provide important constraints useful for improving climate modeling.   Broader Impacts--This project will involve heavy student participation (graduate and undergraduate levels), cross-disciplinary training among geologists, geochemists, and climate modelers, both in the field and laboratory. Undergraduates (geology and education majors) and minority middle-schoolers will take part through mentoring programs. Data will be archived and shared using newly developed web-accessible tools. Finally, we will use results of this research to guide the development of a traveling exhibit on the 'Paleozoic Dust Bowl' in conjunction with the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History and incorporate results in an outreach course taught (by co-PIs) at the Museum."

Documenting blooming patterns, visitors, and floral characteristics in populations across three southeastern states will characterize this apparent syndrome.  This project impacts undergraduates who will perform all stages of science for academic credit. Students will read relevant literature and design experiments, set out field plots, collect and analyze their data. The following spring, students will present their results at the Association for Southeastern Biologists? annual meeting and submit them for publication.  This project initiates the Wine Guild Curriculum Partnership with the GSU Botanical Garden that will impact several thousand K-12 school children and their teachers.

This research will focus on a setting where distributions of the underlying uncertainty are not known.  The decision maker in this environment often faces a large number of alternatives and must make a decision in real-time based on high-volume data streams.  By exploiting specific structures of each problem, this research will develop methodologies that combine real-time decision-making with approximation algorithms for solving complex stochastic optimization problems having large strategy sets.  The research will investigate applications of these algorithms to problems in search-based advertising and supply chain management by working with industry partners.  In addition, the outcome of the research will be integrated into an interactive teaching module or a case study.      The proposed research encompasses many problems in the current information-driven environment, including ad placement in search-based advertising services, inventory management for online retailers, and the multi-armed bandit problem. If successful, the research will result in a unifying framework for studying and analyzing this class of problems, along with a suite of algorithms applicable to these problems.  The research will establish new techniques for extending the performance guarantee of approximation algorithms to reflect long-run average performance of the system, and provide new methodologies for improving the convergence rates by leveraging special structures within each problem.

This project targets to realize the full potential of large-scale multi-core processors as a secure and trustworthy computing substrate. First, in \"many-core\" processors, the availability of a large number of processing elements together with constraints on power consumption alleviates the need for heavy time-sharing of resources, which often results in various types of side-channels. This change enables the use of more dedicated and statically allocated resources in this project to provide strong isolation and a simplified trusted software base. Second, many programmable processing elements in large-scale multi-cores can serve as a general substrate for various types of fine-grained inspection. This project is developing a flexible architecture framework for various run-time checks with minimal overheads in order to automatically detect, diagnose, and recover from malicious software attacks. Finally, the project extends the architectural framework to other aspects of trust beyond security, focusing on post-silicon verification, where the dynamic inspection can ensure various correctness properties. The research will deliver the benefits of hardware support in security and verification without requiring dedicated resources for a single fixed mechanism. Users can use each \"extended core\" for various security purposes, for verification and reliability purposes, or even for general computing. At the same time, the research will also enable highly secure execution environments where critical software components can be better protected."

Through the notion of a secure computation, a set of mutually distrustful agents can collaborate to accomplish a common goal while preserving each agent's privacy---examples include anonymous electronic elections, privacy-preserving electronic auctions or contract biddings, privacy-preserving datamining, fault-tolerant distributed computations and more. Protocols for secure computation have been extensively studied since the 80's, but key obstacles remain unresolved.          In particular, the design of cryptographic protocols must prevent rogue interactions between executions of multiple protocols. Cryptographic protocols that are secure when executed in isolation, can be completely insecure when multiple (even two) such instances are executed concurrently, as is unavoidable on the Internet. New ideas and techniques recently developed (some by this PI) suggest that the intellectual tools are at hand for overcoming this problem. One of the principal goals of the PI?s research is to develop secure computation protocols that remain secure under concurrent executions---without assuming any trusted set-up assumptions. Another goal is to develop new techniques for both preventing and analyzing rogue interactions between protocols.         Broader Significance: This research is expected to develop ideas and techniques which hold the potential to fundamentally change the way we collaborate towards common goals, and in particular to enable the development of protocols for securely collaborating on the Internet.

Liquid water is known to be very strong: plants have been shown to move water during transpiration at pressures down to -10 MPa; in the laboratory, it has been placed at pressures < -102 MPa. Nonetheless, no human technology has ever exploited water at significant negative pressures (i.e., < -1.5 MPa). The negative pressure regime also harbors important information about the outstanding mysteries of water's properties throughout the liquid state: molecular models indicate that the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies not only persist in this regime but also become more dramatic and tightly coupled to the unusual molecular properties of the fluid. Despite significant interest from the scientific community, the thermodynamic, dynamic, and structural properties of water at negative pressures have been virtually uncharted by experiment. This experimental effort is ripe for undertaking due to the emergence of advanced fabrication tools and recent developments in our laboratory of a new method to drive liquid water deep into the negative pressure regime based on thermodynamic coupling of liquid water to a sub-saturated vapor through molecular membranes. The investigator will exploit these tools to build a microfluidic platform with which to manipulate and study water under tension with unprecedented precision. Their studies will map thermodynamic, dynamic, and structural properties of the stretched state of water with an emphasis on elucidating the molecular origins of macroscopic properties. These measurements will allow them to address some of the deepest outstanding questions about the nature of the liquid water and to fill a major gap in the foundation of knowledge for the science and engineering of this unusual state of matter. This effort is also timely, as it will create a dynamic interface with the rapidly progressing developments in computational modeling of water (see letters of collaboration).     Broader Impact: This research has the potential to open a new regime of operation for water management technologies: heat pipes, soil wicks environmental remediation, microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems for separations and purifications, and breathing electrodes for low temperature fuel cells. In all of these technologies, wicks or membranes have been used mediate the flow of water at positive or very slightly negative pressures (>-0.1 MPa), and function is severely limited by the inability to control water under substantial tension. Based on the developments proposed here, these rates of mass transfer could be increased by orders of magnitude and ranges of operational parameters (size, temperature, relative humidity) could be dramatically broadened. Exciting changes in the applications of today's engineers create an obligation to update the curriculum and the modes by which it is taught. The investigator describes plans to modify existing components of the curriculum and add new ones at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Plans are proposed that address critical challenges in modern engineering curricula: 1) the maintenance of effective teaching of fundamental concepts while updating the context to include more material relevant to new contexts such as microchemical technology and bioengineering, 2) the encouragement of innovative use of skills, such that future engineers are poised to invent as well as operate the next generation of technology, and 3) the encouragement of research as a vital component of both undergraduate and graduate education and as a career option. As new technologies emerge, it is also important to educate the public, and, in particular, children on both the timeless (e.g., thermodynamics) and the timely (e.g., micro and nanotechnology) aspects of their function. In Section VII, I propose the development of a set of presentations, demonstrations, and teaching materials that exploit the extraordinary properties of water to motivate experiential science learning. These materials will be developed and presented in collaboration with the outreach program of the Cornell Center for Material Science (see letter), the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, and the Ithaca Sciencenter. These collaborations will enable interaction with people from a broad range of socio economic scales and underrepresented groups."

Unfortunately, complex prediction models per se are not easy to understand. To make them 'digestible', analysts need simpler patterns that summarize the complex functions extracted by the model. The number of such function summaries is overwhelming. Each slice of a lower-dimensional subspace of the original data space could contain an interesting function summary.    The goal of this project is to develop techniques for finding the most 'interesting' function summaries automatically and efficiently. This is done in three steps. First, by formalizing the notion of interestingness for a wide variety of pattern types. Second, by developing a declarative language for specifying these interestingness measures. With a declarative language analysts define what they find interesting, but they need not specify how to find it efficiently. Third, an optimizing compiler for a small language fragment handles the performance efficiency. A major research challenge is to strike the right balance between expressiveness of the language and making it amenable to effective query optimization.    The results of this project will pave the way for powerful exploratory analysis tools. They will also enable future research on optimizers and user-friendly interfaces for the declarative language. The approach will be validated using the rich data resources being organized by the ornithological community in the Avian Knowledge Network (AKN). This will have a tremendous impact on the ability to identify the most significant environmental variables that affect biodiversity on the planet. For example, land managers could discover the possible impact of their decisions on an ecosystem's health.    A component of the language will be available to the public through Web services on the AKN Web site (http://www.avianknowledge.net/content). Additional results will be disseminated through the project Web site (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~mirek/Projects/FunctionSummaries).

To understand how animals locomote, it is necessary to identify and study the neurons in the networks that control locomotion.  Homologs of a set of excitatory interneurons that participate in locomotor control in fish and tadpoles have now been identified in the mouse spinal cord, based on their expression of the Chx10 transcription factor gene.  This proposal will determine whether the function of these Chx10 cells has been conserved in mammals. Optical imaging using calcium-sensitive dyes will be used to study the activity of the Chx10 neurons during the locomotor activity evoked by tail stimulation or transmitter application to the isolated spinal cord.  The principal investigator of the collaborative proposal has generated transgenic mice lacking the Chx10 neurons, which will be used to study the effects of this loss on locomotor activity in the isolated spinal cord.  Finally, the firing properties of Chx10 neurons will be studied as well as their modulation by serotonin, which helps to initiate locomotion.  It is expected that these neurons are essential for normal locomotion, though altered movements (such as synchronous galloping activity) may still occur in the absence of these neurons.  Serotonin should modify these neurons to prepare them for participation in the locomotor network.  This project will help train a postdoctoral fellow and a minority undergraduate to study the organization and function of neural networks that generate simple rhythmic behaviors."

Behavioral genetics holds much promise for understanding the genetics of human disorders such as alcoholism, autism and anxiety, but it is also a controversial enterprise that has, at times, been surrounded by charges of genetic determinism and subjected to media scrutiny. In the past fifteen years, new techniques for manipulating animal genomes have led to an explosion of research on the genetics of human psychiatric disorders using animals such as mice.  This research project will explore some of the challenges of creating convincing animal models, not only with regard to theoretical concerns and practical problems, but also in light of concerns about potential political and social issues.    Behavioral genetics is a heterogeneous discipline, and researchers with different scientific backgrounds hold conflicting opinions on how animals should be used to represent human behaviors. Behavioral testing is also notoriously complex; multiple tests exist for the same behaviors, and the same test can be performed in many different ways.  In order to be useful, these models and tests must be standardized and widely accepted by the behavioral genetics community. Ultimately, the data produced from these models must also be convincing to funding agencies and to the public. Using interviews and participant observation, this project seeks to investigate how standardized experimental practices are developed, debated and circulated in places such as laboratories, scientific publications and conferences, and how results are disseminated to the public.    This study stands to advance our understanding of the challenges faced by scientists studying complex and controversial disorders, and how assumptions about what constitutes a good test or a good representation of the human are embedded into standardized tests and carried forward into later research.  This study also can contribute to our understanding of how scientists conceptualize ethical issues in their research and respond to them in their day-to-day work."

The project will investigate changing ideas during this period about the validity of clinical evidence and the proper methodology for producing such evidence, as well as who is sanctioned to produce it. In researching the epistemic foundations of Russian biomedicine, this work will also follow the process of how these foundations of knowledge have undergone a profound transformation following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  This transformation is directly related to the socio-economic upheavals in Russia precipitated by the collapse of the USSR.      This work will analyze a cooperative project between American and Soviet researchers in cancer chemotherapy, which was conducted under the auspices of the Soviet-American healthcare exchange beginning in 1972.  A study of archival records from this exchange program provides an excellent opportunity to delineate differences between Soviet and American approaches to the production and evaluation of clinical evidence, and to develop a clear picture of Soviet epistemology.  An examination of the exchange program also sheds light on the biopolitics of the period.  Employing qualitative research methods such as ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews at leading Russian oncology centers, as well as careful review of published scientific literature, the project will trace the changes during the post-Soviet period in clinical trial methodology and data evaluation criteria that have been introduced in response to the disappearance of funding, the entrance of the global pharmaceutical industry into the Russian market, and the attempts at healthcare reform by the Russian government and international aid agencies.  This research stands to inform a variety of social science and policy literatures, by presenting a picture of how cancer research on human subjects can be conceived and practiced quite differently in social contexts that change over time."

Substitution of heme cofactors by Zn-porphyrins will enable photo-activation of redox chemistry.  Spectroscopic rate measurements are to be carried out in a set of crystalline complexes between CcP and Cc that display a range of association states and reactivities, set redox center environment and fix molecular orientation. X-ray diffraction studies will directly correlate structure with reactivity. Through mutagenesis, small-molecule complementation, cross-linking, temperature variation, and solvent substitution studies, parameters affecting hopping reactions and protein/solvent dynamics will be systematically probed, all in the context of single crystals. Experiments will be guided and reconciled by computational studies that assess electronic coupling between donor and acceptor sites as a function of conformational state and solvent structure.     The proposed work will reveal how specific parameters, such as bridge structure, conformation, redox potentials and hopping site environment affect long-range ET in heterogeneous systems similar to those synthetically accessible for device development. Dissemination of findings will be facilitated by submission of data to public databases and the development of new web-based tools that readily allow the visualization of structure/function relationships for electron donor/acceptor interactions.

Archer addresses, in an integrated manner, computer architecture researchers' broad need to access powerful computational resources and share simulation environments. The project achieves this objective by deploying a large-scale, flexible, and easy-to-use computing infrastructure which adds users' local computing resources to Archer-dedicated resources as users join the network, thereby increasing Archer's computing power as more users join. In addition, the Archer project comprehends a repository where users can share tools and simulation environments they've created, adding another incentive for users to join the Archer community, facilitating collaboration among research groups, and advancing the field of computer architecture.     The core hardware of Archer consists of computer clusters to be deployed at Cornell University, Florida State U., Northeastern U., Northwestern U., U. FLorida, U. Minnesota, and U. Texas at Austin. The hardware infrastructure provides hundreds of processors to support the demanding simulation workloads required by computer architecture research in areas including soft-error modeling, statistically-based design exploration, and chip-multiprocessor micro-architectures. The key software technologies enabling community resources to be aggregated in a secure, scalable and seamless manner are resource virtualization and robust batch job scheduling, which include the IPOP virtual network from U. Florida and the Condor middleware from U. Wisconsin.     The Archer community resource will enable advances in computer architecture by allowing researchers, particularly those in institutions not equipped with local resources for high-throughput computing, to run large-scale simulation experiments. Its technology provides a new way to swiftly create ad-hoc shared \"Grid\" computing pools within or across institutions, which will pave the way to the creation of similar cyberinfrastructures for other communities."

If the sea floor is composed of sediments, a variety of dissipation mechanisms associated with the sediment rheology play important roles in enhancing wave damping and in modifying wave characteristics. Under this project the investigator will conduct an integrated theoretical and experimental program to accomplish several scientific goals. First, analytical solutions for mud flows under transient wave loadings will be developed to improve our fundamental understanding of various sea bottom dissipative mechanisms and their impacts on transient long wave propagation. Second, An archive of quality detailed experimental data sets that researchers may use to test their own analytic and numerical models will be generated. Third, model-data comparisons will be performed to understand the limitations of analytical solutions and direct numerical simulation (DNS) models for mud flows under wave loadings will be developed to further explore the physical processes. A Navier-Stokes solver with different stress-strain relationships, which depend on the rheology of the fluid mud, will be developed for various wave loadings. Fourth, depth-integrated, phase-resolving wave propagation models with sea bottom dissipative mechanisms included will be developed. A case study is planned to examine the wave attenuation in the Guyana coastal system that is characterized by very thick deposits of Amazon mud.    Broader Impacts: The proposed research activities are at the interface between several field of science and engineering �C oceanography, fluid mechanics, and coastal engineering and will serve a bridge among them. The project will train one PhD student who will receive cutting edge training in experimental techniques, numerical methods and analytical solution techniques. Furthermore, the student will be trained in report writing and oral presentation and he/she will be encouraged to attend technical conferences and meetings. The DNS numerical models to be developed in the proposed project will be useful as research tools for many related engineering science field and can be employed after some modifications to investigate wave�\induced soil failures, debris flows and scouring around coastal structures. The Boussinesq-type wave models with the seafloor dissipative mechanisms considered, which are the main products of the project, will be useful tools for coastal engineers in various applications in the coastal regions where muddy seabeds are present. The new Boussinesq-type model can also be used to investigate the sediment transport and deposit during tsunamis. The laboratory data will be used to benchmark other numerical models under current and other development. To expedite the dissemination of what is learned during the project, we will develop and maintain a project web site, in addition to publishing manuscripts in the peer-reviewed literatures. Most of the investigator��s research activities can be found on the following webpage: http://ceeserver.cee.cornell.edu/pll-group/index.htm Several upper-level undergraduate and graduate student courses at Cornell will be benefit significantly from the research project, as the laboratory measurement techniques developed in the project can be used in these courses.

Using nationally-representative survey data combined with an experimental study that includes self-reports and a biological measure of stress, this research examines whether workers in a numeric minority based on gender do, if fact, encounter greater workplace stress and, if so, whether this stress results in less involvement in group decisions and more physical and psychiatric disorders.  The findings from this study will provide insight to those trying to create effective interventions for retaining women in male-dominated occupations (e.g., in the sciences and engineering) as well interventions that increase the likelihood of minority status individuals contributing to decision making processes in the workplace."

One suggested communication technique is a greater reliance on framing scientific information so that it provides context and resonates with audiences. This project examines how framing affects the communication of a particular scientific issue: the nature and impact of global climate change. Through a series of experiments, the study examines two framing dimensions: the impact of using different types and numbers of examples of people affected by global climate change, and the impact of highlighting different aspects of climate change (such as economics, morality, or averting disaster). Based on previous research, we expect that people will respond more strongly to messages that highlight a single example of a person with whom they can identify. We also expect that the themes will resonate differently with individuals who hold different value orientations. The research program will increase our understanding of the role that social identification cues and interpretive schemas play in the affective and behavioral responses to persuasive messages that use different frame themes and structures."

The Symposium is to be held in June 1-6, 2008 in Zeuthen, Germany. Matrix computations, a central topic in numerical linear algebra, plays a central role in scientific computing and is at the heart of many numerical procedures for partial differential equations and optimization. More recently, matrix methods have found their way in computational biology and a host of information science applications. The Householder symposia contribute to the vibrancy of this field by bringing together scholars from all over the world, both young and old, for five days of informal research exchanges. Multicore technologies have placed a premium on methods that scale and so it is no surprise that model reduction, low rank tensor approximation, and data compression, will be recurring themes at the Symposium. Matrix dimensions are so large in certain applications that radically new approaches are required,  e.g., matrix factorizations that are based on sampling and data structures  that match multilevel memory systems. Attendees of Householder XVII will exit the meeting with a sharpened sense of ``large n'' matrix computations.     There are several reasons why the  Symposium is a particularly effective vehicle for ``jump starting'' the careers of its young attendees. There is an emphasis on ongoing research and an invitation process that proactively favors budding researchers. There is a deliberate attempt to build a communal sense of where the field is headed through specific ``forward thinking'', open microphone, panel discussions. Because it is the premier conference in the area, the Symposium attracts the top senior researchers from around the world; it is a ``must attend'' event. The intermingling of established researchers with the fresh PhDs is guaranteed because the conference is modest in size (about 150) and everyone who attends gives a talk. Enabling  USA-based early career scientists to attend the Householder Symposium on Numerical Linear Algebra ensures the well being of a field that is critical to American Science and Engineering.

The first goal is focused on understanding how additives with selective affinity for a given block will distribute and modify the structure of complex DBC bicontinuous phases (like the gyroid, double diamond, and plumbers nightmare phases where the minority component block forms two interweaving 3D networks); it is envisioned that a suitable choice of additive type, size, affinity, and concentration may suppress or stabilize a particular bicontinuous phase. A specific aim is thus to elucidate the design of optimal additives (e.g., in size and topology) that maximize the composition range of stability of a target bicontinuous phase. The existence of competing co-continuous phases (those whose minority block forms a single 3D network) will also be investigated. Our second goal is to systematically quantify the effect of disparities in block thickness and backbone flexibility on bicontinuous phase behavior. Athermal molecules having intrinsic disparities in thickness (shape) and stiffness can lead to asymmetrical  packing interactions, i.e., an effective  \"repulsion\" between opposite ends of the particles which could give rise to a phase behavior akin to that of conventional DBCs (that have an energetic inter-block disparity). There will be an investigation as to how to design systems where entropy, as opposed to energy, would be the main driving force underlying the assembly of different bicontinuous phases. Starting from the analysis of bicontinuous phases of pure DBCs via both on-lattice Monte Carlo simulations and continuum space Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, the following tasks are carried out: (i) determining the effect of selective additives (polymers and nanoparticles) of different sizes and structure on such bicontinuous phases, particularly in the particle-concentrated regime, (ii) simulating off-lattice coarse-grained models of DBC-like molecules with varying disparities in block affinity, flexibility, and thickness (pure and with additives) to determine how such changes affect the phase behavior and how they could be exploited to stabilize different bicontinuous phases. To map out reliable phase diagrams and improve ergodic sampling, several Monte Carlo methods are used and further developed; in particular, optimized expandedensemble techniques for measuring free-energies and for chemical potential equilibration.    Broader Impacts    This investigation provides phase diagrams that will serve as \"road maps\" which could not only be used to correlate simulations with experimental data but also to guide future experimental efforts toward more technologically targeted systems. Given Today's unprecedented ability to synthesize copolymers of precise architecture and composition as well as hybrid organic-inorganic materials and nanoparticles, a better microscopic understanding of the structure and phase behavior of fluids containing these building blocks could provide a sounder basis for rational design of new materials for future applications, including energy-storing devices like fuel cells. The close collaboration of the PI with an experimental group at Cornell provides the synergy between simulation and  experimental efforts and that our findings will also be disseminated within the community of  experimental polymer-chemists. Dissemination of results to industry is made through Cornell's annual Polymer Outreach Program symposium.     The main educational outcome will be the training of a Ph.D. student who will also serve as a link with an experimental group at Cornell. In addition, it is expected that al least one undergraduate researcher from a different university will work on this project during a Summer via the REU program of CCMR (Cornell Center for Materials Research) and another Cornell undergraduate during two regular Semesters. Results of this investigation will be used in at least two classes: a new course on molecular simulations, and the advanced thermodynamics core course."

After the disaster, scientists and engineers have been working together to establish an early tsunami warning system and tsunami hazard mitigation programs in the Indian Ocean region. A promising approach for improving our understanding of tsunamis is to use the deposits they create. The long term goal of our research is to relate tsunami hydrodynamics to sediment transport processes on continental shelf and coastal zone. The PIs believe that the path to reach this goal is to understand the boundary layer flow characteristics under solitary (or leading depression) waves. Recent studies on surface and internal waves show that global instabilities (a particular type of spontaneously triggered shear instability of fixed spatial extent) could occur during the flow deceleration phase at certain Reynolds numbers, leading to vortex shedding and turbulence. The PI's plan here to extend the spectral multidomain penalty method model developed by the Co-PI to further investigate the boundary layer flows under solitary (and LDN) waves in both 2D and 3D. The research activities outlined here are at the interface between several field of science and engineering-  oceanography, fluid mechanics, and coastal engineering and will serve as a bridge among them. The planned research is the first phase of a long term fundamental research program, which aims at correlating the tsunami hydrodynamics with the sediment deposits left behind by the tsunamis.

A second set of Lagrangian measurements will be focused on the impact of large-scale anisotropy and inhomogeneities on the motion of particles. These measurements will be carried out in a high- Reynolds-number wind tunnel facility developed under the MRI grant. The PIs will modify the earlier experiments in two ways. First, homogeneous turbulent shear flow (HTSF) and a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) will be studied by introducing a shear generator or a flat plate into the test section of the wind tunnel. Second, two additional cameras will be incorporated into the optical setup, enabling 3D particle trajectories to be measured allowing study of the effect of large-scale anisotropy on the motion of particles. Aside from the fundamental information these measurements will provide, the PIs will test the LES in increasingly complex (realistic) flows to discover what elements of the model would need further development to accommodate large-scale anisotropy. DNS of HTSF with particles will be performed using a newly developed spectral code, and Lagrangian particle statistics will be measured. DNS will support testing of the LES subgrid closure in limits of the parameter space that cannot be reached by the experiment. In addition, data from the DNS test the particle tracking codes used in the experiment. The planned Lagrangian measurements and DNS will uncover the effect mean velocity gradients and walls have on the motion of particles, providing an important testbed for the LES model, as well as new knowledge to be made available to the community via publications and a public web site. The PIs have been heavily involved with outreach throughout their careers. Recent activities include middle school and high school activities for girls, recruiting and mentoring of minority graduate students through the Sloan Fellowship program and the NSF AGEP award the PIs share, and outreach within the community on the environment. The PIs also recently created the International Collaboration on Turbulence Research (ICTR) to facilitate interactions with other members of our community throughout the world."

NIMS are created by covalent attachment of charged oligomers to the surface of nanoparticles. The charge on the oligomer is balanced by a counterion species that can vary from a compact molecular entity such as a chloride ion, to a more bulky organic species such as an Isosterate ion. Depending on the interactions between the components (core particles, attached oligomers, and associated counterions), physical properties of the materials can be tuned over a surprisingly wide range. On one end of the spectrum are materials with high core particle content, which display properties similar to glasses, stiff waxes, and gels.  At the opposite extreme are systems that spontaneously form homogeneous particle-based ionic fluids, characterized by transport properties remarkably similar to simple Newtonian liquids comprised of molecular building-blocks. These nanoparticle ionic fluids resemble molecular ionic liquids in their ability to form zero vapor pressure, ?green?, solvents with high dielectric constants. Because they contain an inorganic particle core, however, a more exciting array of properties can be accessed. The proposed research uses a combination of experiment, theory, and computer simulations to understand the fundamental forces in NIMS and to determine how these forces influence their transport properties. Our preliminary studies indicate that nanoparticle ionic fluids are the first example of a system of particles of any size that can reach equilibrium without a solvent. These studies also indicate that two new types of interactions are important for understanding the stability of our fluids and for predicting their transport properties: (i) An entropic attraction force arising from attachment of the effective solvent to the core particles; and (ii) Electrostatic forces due to surface-attached, bendable dipoles on the cores.  Broader Impacts: The NIMS core particle is an inorganic nanostructure. This open possibility for creating entirely new types of hybrid fluids based upon the vast library of available inorganic particle chemistries and shapes. The unique properties possible in such fluids makes them attractive for a host of applications, including high-conductivity heat-transfer liquids, inkjet printable semiconducting inks, stable electrolytes for high-temperature batteries, light-weight conformal armor for military and law-enforcement personnel, and high refractive index liquids for photolithograph. Most of these applications are inaccessible to fluids created from molecular building blocks. The proposed research is the first attempt to develop fundamental understanding of the interaction forces that control structure and properties of these types of fluids. We believe that our work will provide crucial guidance on how to select components (e.g. core particle size, shape, volume fraction, corona and counterion molecular weight, and chemistry), for the many applications targeted. Furthermore, because our fluids combine elements of colloids, polymers, and complex-fluid behavior in a single material, we believe that results from the proposed research will help expand and modernize the literature on colloidal phenomena and complex fluid flows. We believe a direct result of the range of applications that will be impacted by our materials, is that transfer of knowledge developed in the study to the classroom will be more rapid than normal for subjects in the field. The novelty of NIMS and their relevance to easily appreciated applications also provides new opportunities for attracting younger students (K-12) to science. Specifically, in collaboration with the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR), we will develop demonstrations based on applications of the materials, e.g. as inkjet printable inks, conformal body armor, and high-index liquids for photolithography. Our goals for these demonstrations are to engage students at an early age to think about materials in terms of their fundamental units or building blocks, and to recognize the connection between physical properties and the forces between these units. We also believe that video demonstrations connecting flow transitions in NIMS to structural transitions revealed by scattering experiments will help advanced students appreciate relationships between transport properties of complex fluids and their interactions. We will use these video demonstrations in our undergraduate Fluid Mechanics (ChemE 323) and graduate Polymer Physics (ChemE 745) courses, and also plan to take advantage of the YouTube web portal to disseminate them to a broader audience."

The methods and analysis will focus on the control of non-point source pollution of Cannonsville watershed which provides freshwater supply to New York City.  The intellectual merit of this proposal is derived from a very well characterized watershed. The PI and her group are well-qualified to carry out this ambitious project. The optimization routines are extensions of their previous work and may provide tools that speed up and reduce the cost of management procedures one of the major strengths of this excellent proposal is that the time frame extends significantly in the future (2078) so that long term trends are taken into account. The efforts to develop and extend their modeling approach are easily justified considering the need to apply such models nationwide (and likely a major effort in the Water Network).  The dynamic modeling of Cannonsville watershed as proposal will also provide a test bed for future efforts as climate change affects the region. It is possible that with time the water input functions (rain) will change as may the vegetative cover. Therefore, I could envision that this modeling effort will evolve with time, as it should. In particular, the Cannonsville watershed area might provide the 'model' watershed to study so that when the model is exported to other area, the water quality monitoring can be optimized (that is the minimum number of monitoring sites employed) to maximize the data necessary for watershed modeling. If this proposal is only successful for this on watershed then it will be a success. The section of broader impacts of the proposal is also excellent and could serve a model for others."

The project involves the development of a Web-based, Interactive Evolutionary Algorithm to enhance the creativity of human users in designing complex three-dimensional forms, such as tensegrity architecture. A Co-Evolutionary User Modeling Algorithm capable of generating and maintaining a population of user models will serve as critic and collaborator for the human user. By learning the user's implicit goals and cognitive style we can accelerate the creative design process. A creativity-enhancing generative representation capable of encoding families of designs will capture underlying design dimensions. The design engine will be responsible for integrating the information from the evolved user models in order to automatically generate both surprising (critical) and predictable (collaborative) candidate designs for the human designer. The project develops measures of the creativity of the human-computer design system as a whole, by measuring the complexity and novelty of designs produced by the human user. The ability to enhance a user's creativity, and the ability to rapidly synthesize the demands of a large set of users, has immediate applications in several design domains outside of engineering and architecture. The enhancement of educational software, the design of consumer packaging, and artistic endeavors, among many others, all have much to gain from an open ended framework capable of collaborative discovery."

On one hand, strong axioms such as the Proper Forcing  Axiom and Woodin's Pmax axiom are invoked to build embeddings and  morphisms between structures such as linear orders and topological  spaces.  Since these strong axioms themselves imply that the cardinality  of the real line is the second uncountable cardinal, it is natural to  ask whether the classification theorems which follow from them already  fix the cardinality of the continuum.  The research supported by this  grant aims to prove new classification results from these strong axioms,  to better understand the relationship between these classification  results and the value of the continuum, and to improve our understanding  of the strong axioms themselves.    The oldest results in set theory concern the rigorous development of the  \"size\" of an infinite set.  The cardinal numbers provide a linear scale  with which one can measure the number of elements a set has --- also  known as its cardinality.  One of the earliest questions in set theory  was Cantor's Continuum Problem: Determine the cardinality of the real  number line.  In the 1960s, this problem was shown to be independent of  the usual axioms of mathematics.  Still, it is unclear whether some  other compelling mathematical statement, also undecidable, might settle  the Continuum Problem.  Moore's research aims to both establish the  independence of new classification results for infinite mathematical  structures and to relate these results to the Continuum Problem."

The PIs have already had some success using ADP to devise a relocation scheme for stylized models of ambulance operations, whereby ambulances are moved in real time in anticipation of future demand. A short-term goal is to move closer to full implementation through existing close relationships with a provider of software for emergency-service planning. In the longer term, any links between ADP and SO will likely lead to effective computational methods for making real-time decisions in complex systems that are subject to significant uncertainty. These methods will find applications not only in the emergency services, but also in transportation logistics, supply chain management, revenue management and potentially many other fields."

Preliminary studies have shown that the demand for discretionary purchase items, such as automobiles, apparel, consumer electronics, and home furnishings is correlated with the movement of economic indicators. These findings present an opportunity to use information about market expectations embedded in the prices of financial instruments to improve demand forecasting, production planning, and inventory thus reducing risk. This project aims to establish that the market indicators can be used to plan inventories in supply chains that are optimal not just in a static sense but also dynamically, and to test whether and how the value of the firm is correlated with the economic indicators driving the forecasts. The proposed work also includes the examination of the effect of price information on inventories when the price of the product can be forecasted using prices of traded market instruments.     The project consists of four parts: forecasting, optimal decision-making, hedging, and empirical validation. If successful, this research will lead to better understanding of the connections between economic factors with supply chain demand and inventory planning. The results will provide a mechanism to inventory planners to use readily available and reliable market information for inventory planning, profit forecasting, and hedging purposes. They also provide a systematic method for developing and testing profit and risk equations using models of supply chains, and allow the enterprises to better understand how the cost of procurement and the volatility of prices and demand affect risk in a simple and joint manner, and thus, the firms will be able to make use of market factors in designing inventory and production systems."

First, many SO problems possess structure such as convexity or unimodality that, if detected, can improve one?s understanding of the problem itself, and be exploited in selecting solution algorithms. Numerical methods will be developed to detect such structure. Second, performance measures, and methods for efficiently computing them, will be developed to enable theoretically sound comparisons of the performance of SO algorithms on test problems. Third, a testbed of SO problems will be developed.    If awarded, the ability to numerically detect problem structure will greatly improve understanding of one?s problem formulations, and allow greater use of specialized algorithms that exploit structure. This could also lead to users formulating problems to adhere to those structures, with the result that many new subclasses of SO problems might be created. The testbed, along with appropriate performance measures, should help to encourage algorithm comparisons and development. We might then be able to tackle far larger SO problems than is possible today.  The results of the research will find application in areas such as emergency services, transportation logistics, supply chain management, revenue management and potentially many other fields."

An important example of the latter that is often a precursor to life-threatening arrhythmias is electrical alternans, in which two successive paced beats elicit electrical responses (and thus mechanical responses) of different amplitudes and durations. Despite much attention, fundamental characteristics about alternans remain under-studied, and attempts to use electrical interventions to control alternans have not been successful on a global level. Our research aims to advance the understanding of cardiac alternans at the most basic level and to use this knowledge to implement improved schemes of electrical control using fundamental nonlinear dynamics principles. In particular, we will characterize the type of period-doubling bifurcation underlying electrical alternans, develop mathematical models to investigate the dynamical and biophysical mechanisms underlying alternans, and to implement and test novel control algorithms. Mathematical modeling and computer simulations in single-and multi-processor environments will be used in conjunction with experimental techniques, including microelectrodes, laser-scanning confocal microscopy, and optical mapping using fluorescence signals obtained with voltage-sensitive dyes in cardiac tissue. The proposed research will elucidate the nature of the period-doubling bifurcation to electrical alternans, quantify the roles of intracellular calcium dynamics and transmembrane voltage in the origin of alternans, and improve the understanding of global control algorithms in tissue. In the course of this project, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research and will benefit from an interdisciplinary environment. A key component of the project is to promote broad dissemination of information. The mathematical models and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available free as stand alone codes and interactive Java applets via web sites. Results will be presented as well, with a special emphasis on interactive programs and animations for both scientists and the general public. Ultimately, this research may lead to improved treatments for life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias: by preventing alternans, the lethal cardiac arrhythmias that alternans can trigger also can be avoided. Furthermore, the improved understanding of electrical abnormalities and novel methods for controlling complex dynamics may translate to other related systems, including the brain and peripheral nervous system and other types of muscle."

For example, welfare state and labor market institutions may provide different opportunities and incentives for business ownership to men and women; culturally informed assumptions about gender may generate biased evaluations of female entrepreneurs? competence and commitment, and the perceived viability and innovativeness of their business ideas. Thus, the theoretical claim this research advances and evaluates is that institutional arrangements structure the overall context in which men and women perceive business ownership as a viable labor market option, whereas cognitive biases structure the social interactions through which they seek advice, legitimacy and financial support for a business endeavor. The research tests the effect of policies on gender inequality in business ownership across 25 industrialized countries by matching data on national institutions from the World Bank and the United Nations with Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey data on entrepreneurs. The influence of cognitive bias on the evaluation of businesses will be examined with experimental vignette studies conducted at research universities in the United States and the United Kingdom. Conducting the experiments in two cultural contexts sheds light on the extent to which such biases may vary or be stable across these different cultural contexts.    This research offers new insight into the social interactional mechanisms that support aggregate patterns of gender inequality in entrepreneurship, thereby integrating the sociological concept of a multilevel gender structure with the study of entrepreneurship. If confirmed, the predictions will pioneer a new theoretical perspective on gender inequality in entrepreneurship that extends beyond personality-based arguments and builds upon human capital and network explanations. Next, this project will be the first to apply sociological theory about cognitive bias to the topic of entrepreneurship and to evaluate it in multiple cultural contexts. Lastly, the research speaks to the debate over the concept of entrepreneurship by ?gendering? the way in which innovation is analyzed.     Broader Impacts.  First, this project has the potential to inform policies aimed at increasing the number of women among business owners and leaders in business innovation. For example, if the research suggests that cognitive bias influences entrepreneurship, strategies such as increasing awareness of bias on the part of financial investors and increasing publicly available information about financing sources may help accomplish this goal. Second, by conducting the research in a foreign scientific community, the project will contribute to an international dialogue about research on unconscious bias. Results will be disseminated at conferences in the US and Europe and in sociology publications. Third, hundreds of undergraduates from diverse backgrounds at universities in two countries will participate. Through the participation and debriefing process, students increase their awareness about the social issues being studied. Such exposure may also increase the likelihood that these students will consider scientific careers."

Developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa are rapidly establishing stock markets despite the frequent lack of institutional frameworks needed to facilitate the operation of sophisticated markets.  This dissertation seeks to answer: 1) What institutional arrangements are transplanted from first-world sources to developing countries and how effectively are they translated into their new environments; 2) What difficulties do regulators face in enforcing newly adopted regulations, and what role is played by formal regulation in establishing confidence in these new markets; and 3) What factors affect investment options available in sub-Saharan stock markets?     Quantitative data will be collected from a sample of seven stock markets in sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe).  Quantitative data collection will focus on levels and types of firm and shareholder participation, market performance data, involvement by foreign advisors, rates of regulatory rule violations, availability of investment instruments, and qualifications of domestic regulators.  Qualitative data will also be gathered through in-depth interviews with market regulators, intermediaries, and listed and unlisted firms in Kenya and Tanzania.  Collecting qualitative data on topics similar to the quantitative aspects will add explanatory depth and clarity to the quantitative analysis.

Smith          Abstract   Abstract     Many imaging tasks involve ill-posed problems, which require realistic priors. Standard convex optimization techniques use priors that prefer globally smooth images, and thus tend to give poor results. Graph cut methods, which permit edge-preserving priors for a restricted class of ill-posed problems, have proven quite successful over the last decade.     This research project will address an important but challenging class of ill-posed problems, namely those arising from rank-deficient linear inverse systems. Such underconstrained problems occur in medical imaging tasks such as MRI&CT image reconstruction and fMRI undistortion, as well as in traditional vision problems such as super- resolution. Currently these applications rely on convex optimization methods, which do not support realistic image priors. Yet existing graph cut methods cannot be applied due to some difficult theoretical issues.     To overcome these challenges we propose a collaboration between computer vision researchers and experts in graph algorithms. We will develop new graph constructions to address linear inverse systems, drawing heavily on state-of-the-art techniques from boolean optimization. To simplify our task we will exploit specific properties of the rank-deficient linear inverse systems that arise in the applications of interest. We will focus primarily on sparse structured linear inverse systems, an important subclass which contains all of the applications that drive our work. While our proposed work stresses algorithm development, we will also do a significant experimental evaluation of new algorithms on a range of applications, both to assess their performance and to identify promising new avenues.     This project brings together experts in computer vision, medical imaging and graph algorithms to address a problem of broad interest in a novel manner. The linear inverse systems that we are concerned with arise in a wide range of medical applications, as well as in other areas, yet current techniques have significant shortcomings. Our approach draws heavily on methods developed by the investigators over the last decade, which have proven quite successful for related problems. In addition, this project will strengthen the ties between researchers in computer vision and algorithms, which have proven to be quite beneficial to both areas.

Quantum mechanics has shown itself to be correct in laboratory experiments and tests, with no known exceptions. In spite of this, there are conceptual problems with applying quantum mechanics to larger objects and length scales. For instance, quantum mechanics says that the energy of vibrating mechanical system should quantized, with only discreet values of the energy possible. Furthermore, the theory requires that position measurements will necessarily perturb the motion of the mechanical structure, called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Both of these predictions are far outside our normal experience of classical reality. This project will pursue experiments to probe these subtle and bizarre effects in small mechanical structures formed by billions of atoms. This will be accomplished by employing the most advance tools of experimental science: nanofabrication, ultra-low temperature physics, and quantum computing electronic devices. This project will support the education of a PhD student in these advanced technologies, which has historically shown itself to be excellent training for many scientific careers from academia to our most advanced technology industries. This project will either succeed to show quantum mechanics is true at bizarrely large length scales, or we will fail and possibly find new features to quantum mechanics which are not yet known. Both possibilities would change our understanding of quantum mechanics and our view of the physical world.    ****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****  This project will pursue experiments to probe quantum measurement limits in mechanical structures. The techniques are in hand to produce and measure the quantum ground state of a small, radio frequency mechanical structure formed by 10 billion atoms. This will be accomplished using a nanomechanical structure coupled to a very low loss, superconducting microwave resonator. Furthermore, using these techniques, it appears possible to produce detection with avoids the backaction required by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) for continuous measurement, and to produce squeezed states, where the uncertainties periodically dip below the HUP. By careful study of the decay of these squeezed states, it is expected to be able to provide a quantitative test of environmental decoherence mechanisms for a somewhat macroscopic body. These experiments are now only very recently possible due to the latest advances in nano-electro-mechanical devices, superconducting electronics technology. This project will support the education of a PhD student in these advanced technologies, which has historically shown itself to be excellent training for many scientific careers from academia to our most advanced technology industries. These experiments are expected to be of general interest to the scientific community and to provide ultra-sensitive readout techniques especially for the community pursing sensitive detection at the nano-scale."

This theoretical machinery predicts biological networks by how rapidly they can be learned from the random examples provided by mutation and selection. The approach assumes the networks in living things can be built incrementally and grow continually by stepwise increases in fitness. They are not necessarily global optimum. Network evolution will be modeled with simplified differential equations for the central molecular components of developmental pathways, e.g., transcription factors, ligand-receptors interactions, protein-protein complexes, kinases and phosphorylated proteins etc. Evolution requires a fitness function and rapid evolution is facilitated by a smooth monotone function, not a jagged landscape. This is in accord with the goal of evolving patterning networks common to all animals, not specific phyla. A plausible fitness function quantifies how well embryonic position is related to gene expression patterns.

This breadth, and the classical nature of the questions being asked, means that the proposal connects several mathematical subfields, in particular geometric group theory and the topics of lattices, rigidity, buildings, and algebraic and Kac-Moody groups.  In analogy with Bass-Serre theory, used for studying tree lattices, the theory of complexes of groups and their coverings is used as a powerful tool for studying lattices in automorphism groups of higher-dimensional complexes.    Lattices arise as discrete sets of symmetries of many spaces, and are important in physics and chemistry.

While the concept of inherent randomness is central to quantum mechanics, it cannot be described in terms of traditional probability alone, i.e. notions such as observed random variables, sample spaces etc. are not sufficient. On the simplest level, finite probability laws have to be replaced by states, which are defined as complex positive definite Hermitian matrices of trace one. A very general framework is provided by the theory of operator algebras. In quantum statistical decision theory, families of states generalize families of probability measures (statistical experiments), and the tensor product of many  states replaces the classical simple random sample. One problem which is already known in the classical context is the risk asymptotics for symmetric hypothesis testing, or Bayesian discrimination of two states with equal prior weights (the Chernoff bound on the exponential rate of decay of the error probability). In the recent solution of this problem on the quantum level by the investigator and coauthors, a new method has been developed to reduce the quantum risk to a classical one, via associating a pair of probability distributions to a pair of states by measurement on a purification. The present project aims at exploring further this new method, with regard to wider applicability in quantum testing, estimation and possibly in approximation of quantum statistical experiments. Further subjects of study are quantum statistical applications of information theoretic concepts like channel capacity, Kolmogorov complexity, and rate distortion.    Natural phenomena on the very small (subatomic) level are governed by quantum theory, where physical laws and cause-effect relationships are thoroughly different from the world of ordinary human experience. Physicists and computer scientists realized some time ago that these phenomena might be harnessed to build computers of extraordinary speed, and also allow rapid advances in cryptography such as breaking all presently known secret codes or constructing new unbreakable ones. While quantum computers have long remained an abstract idea and have only been built at an embryonic stage so far, the theoretical groundwork for far-reaching applications is already being laid in the interdisciplinary field of Quantum Information Theory. In the need for finding benchmarks for optimal performance, researchers in this field have recently begun to exploit some well  developed theories of signal processing and statistics. The present project is situated precisely at this new frontier between traditional statistics and quantum theory.

A new multivariate model is suggested as a construct for analysis of covariance which provides a unified framework for adjusting treatment means in balanced and unbalanced design settings. Second, a new approximation for the number of contingency tables and tables of zeros and ones, meeting certain linear constraints, is proposed. This is relevant, for example, in determining the feasibility of exact conditional analysis of log-linear models. The approximation arises from a novel formulation of the problem in terms of a generalized linear model for geometric responses. The approximation is much more generally applicable, and appears to be far more accurate, than exiting competitors. Third, a practical fitting algorithm for a broad class of mixed effects models with analytically intractable likelihood functions is proposed. The approach involves an implementation of the Monte Carlo EM algorithm that uses a randomized spherical-radial integration rule at the E-step. Use of this integration rule reduces the required Monte Carlo sample size by two orders of magnitude in test cases.    Statistical models are ubiquitous in almost all areas of modern research, including such diverse fields as agriculture, economics, medicine, and sociology. Advances in computing power enable statisticians to consider models and do calculations that were not feasible even a few years ago. This research targets three problems related to widely-used statistical models. The first concerns a technique for adjusting treatment means in designed experiments to account for observed covariates related to the response of interest. This is a classical problem with its roots in agricultural field trials. The technique has a long history dating back to the mid-20th century. It is somewhat surprising then that there is still disagreement on the correct way to make the adjustments, even in simple balanced experiments. An explanation is that the mathematical tools and computing power necessary for a complete solution were not available when the method was first developed. The second problem relates to the feasibility of exact statistical tests when data is sparse, and the standard approximations break down. Exact methods are used, for example, in medical studies testing for factors associated with various diseases. Finally, a new fitting algorithm is proposed for an important class of statistical models. Test cases suggest that the methods will significantly extend the range of models for which the computations are practically feasible."

The first is the large-sample theory of penalized splines. The second is Bayesian calibration and uncertainty analysis for computational expensive models. The theory for univariate penalized splines  is generalized to quadratic and higher degree splines and to higher order difference penalties. The univariate theory is extended to additive models and to bivariate regression. Penalized splines methods are developed for deconvolution with heteroscedastic measurement error. Bayesian calibration and  uncertainty analysis is studied in the cases of spatial-temporal correlations, measurement error in environmental inputs, and multiple responses.    Splines are mathematical tools for defining curves and surfaces. Splines are used, for example, to describe the shape of an automobile body in computer-assisted design. In statistics, splines are used to describe curved relationships between variables. For example, a recent study of the  relationship between blood-lead concentration and IQ in children used splines and found an unexpected and important result. The dose-response curve is steepest at low doses, meaning that, at low doses, IQ declines with increasing lead concentrations more rapidly than previously realized. This unanticipated finding implies that, if environmental lead concentrations are reduced, then the intellectual development of children will be improved by an amount exceeding what was previously thought. Splines are particularly useful in this  type of study because they can be combined with adjustments for maternal IQ and other factors and for correlations between multiple IQ measurements on a single subject. The investigator studies splines to improve the precision of estimation and to extend the range of applicability. Calibration of complex  models is used in a variety of applications including, for example, petroleum exploration and management of watersheds. The PI and his colleagues study the Cannonsville watershed, a source of drinking water for New York City. Calibration of a model means using data to estimate unknown parameters. Uncertainty analysis measures the precision of the estimates. Calibration and uncertainty analysis is needed so that these models can be used for management. For example, the model for the Cannonsville Reservoir helps NYC manage the watershed to maintain water so that expensive filtration systems are not needed."

A paradigm, originating with Demmel in the 1980's, relating  conditioning, ill-posedness, and computational speed, inspires  the investigator's thinking.  The study of matrix pseudospectra  powerfully illustrates the general technique:  fundamental  indicators of transient dynamical behavior, pseudospectra have a  rich structure, blending complex and matrix analysis,  semi-algebraic geometry, and numerical linear algebra, all  ingredients in pseudospectral optimization.  Semi-algebraic  geometry in particular is developing into a fundamental tool not  just in applications such as pseudospectra, but throughout  variational analysis.  The investigator uses this approach, for  example, to study novel structural tools such as \"partial  smoothness\", thereby analyzing convergence rates observed in  computational practice.  Fundamental to the investigator's  approach is a complex blend of variational analysis, classical  mathematics, numerical computation, and applied modeling.          Often the designer of a complex engineering system varies  certain features in order to optimize some aspect of system  performance.  A simple example is a shock-absorber:  by varying  the grade of lubricant it contains, the manufacturer can modify  how stiff a suspension system feels.  Finding optimal choices for  damping vibrations in such a physical, electronic, communications  or information system is \"nonsmooth\": choices are very sensitive  to slight changes in the system, one reason they seem hard to  compute.  The investigator facilitates this important but  challenging optimization process by blending mathematical  modeling and analysis with scientific computation.  He  disseminates his research energetically through expository and  technical publications, high-profile lectures, and online, to  diverse international scientific and engineering audiences.  As  an integral part of the project, the investigator's PhD students  develop crucial skills bridging divisions between sophisticated  mathematical theory and the many practical applications of  nonsmooth optimization."

In contrast to metallic systems, 3He has a spherical Fermi surface; yet anisotropic paired states emerge from the isotropic normal liquid. Confinement of 3He in small geometries is expected to modify this behavior. It has been theoretically predicted that confined superfluid 3He will exhibit broken translational symmetry en route to the destruction of superfluidity. Dimensional constraints might also promote the stability of competing phases that are not manifest in the bulk. The technology to fabricate confining geometries with well characterized surfaces that can be patterned to achieve specified roughness has been developed at Cornell University. The roughness will affect the resulting phases via their stability and response to disorder ? an important feature that has implications for the broader relevance of this work to Condensed Matter Physics. Patterning to introduce periodicity and test the robustness of emerging phases of confined 3He against periodicity is also planned.  We will also construct and use high precision flow cells to examine flow of 4He, 3He doped 4He films and eventually superfluid 3He in nanoporous media. These demanding experiments, which require development of new techniques, provide a challenging environment where graduate and undergraduate students acquire skills (the ability to innovate, initiate, design and carry out) as well as become familiar with analytic and display tools to prepare them for careers in the Nation's scientific and technological infrastructure. The research program will be integrated with partner programs at Royal Holloway University of London and Manchester University. Graduate students will have the opportunity to work with their counterparts by spending a semester in the UK and by hosting counterparts at Cornell. The research program will also incorporate an undergraduate student throughout the award period.    Non-Technical Abstract  Helium (unlike all other elements) is inherently quantum-mechanical and does not solidify (unless compressed) even down to absolute zero temperature. It is one of the purest materials that can be prepared by any means, since at these temperatures, impurities simply freeze out during the procedures required to obtain the liquid state. Eventually 3He attains a highly ordered state: superfluidity, which is different from that attained in most superconductors and its sister isotope 4He. The magnetism of the superfluid atoms means that the atoms pair up together and undergo orbital motion exhibiting different phases. These behaviors are affected by confining 3He within precisely characterized geometries that effectively alter the dimensionality of the 3He. By carrying out precise measurements on these systems the research will add to our understanding of the role of confinement under less extreme conditions. The program will also prepare graduate students for an increasingly international scientific and technological environment by embedding them in (and allowing them to host students from) counterpart laboratories that use different techniques to probe the same systems. Besides adding to the understanding of quantum systems, this research provides a demanding experimental environment that educates and trains graduate and undergraduate students for successful careers in the Nation's scientific and technological infrastructure. In addition, this research program will also create a positive impact on future science and technology workforce by involving a science teacher in this research during summer."

In some cases, exact periodicity is observed, while in other cases the light curves show stochastic fluctuations or quasi-periodic oscillations. Understanding these magnetized stars requires global 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling. Recent 3D and 2.5D MHD simulations performed by Dr. Romanova and her collaborators have shown a wide variety of possible paths of matter flow around magnetized stars, including the possibility of direct accretion through the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. These investigations have shown that magnetized stars may be either in the stable or unstable regime of accretion, with strikingly different observational properties. This and other interesting phenomena found in their MHD simulations may describe different properties or stages of evolution of different accreting magnetized stars.    However, to compare the results with observations, one needs to calculate continuum and line spectra from the stars and the surrounding matter. This requires high-level radiative transfer modeling, which is the primary goal of this project:  to perform full 3D radiative transfer modeling, using the results of the 3D MHD simulations as a base. Results of such 3D (MHD) + 3D (radiative) models will be compared with observations of different Classical T Tauri stars for which spectral and photometric observational data are available. A number of new MHD simulations will be done aimed at understanding different phenomena around magnetized stars, including (1) accretion through instabilities; (2) modeling of outflows; (3) investigation of disk oscillations and warping generated by a misaligned dipole.    It is expected that this research will be an important new step in modeling accreting magnetized stars. Two modern state-of-the-art codes (3D MHD and radiative transfer) will be combined in a major effort to understand the physics of magnetized stars. The results will be valuable for understanding the whole range of accreting magnetized stars, from magnetic brown dwarfs to neutron stars. The results on disk oscillations and warping will be valuable for understanding processes around compact stars. The methods and numerical MHD codes developed here also have general value and are applicable in other areas of science such as planetary science, geophysics, earth magnetospheric science and heliospheric science, and in engineering.     The project is ideal for training young scientists - graduate and undergraduate students - who will learn magnetohydrodynamics and programming, how to parallelize the codes, and to write auxiliary programs. The project will also support a public exhibition at the Ithaca Sciencenter on the birth of stars featuring the roles of accretion and plasma physics."

The pulsar survey will complement and transcend previous surveys by reaching more than twice the distance of the very successful multibeam survey using the Parkes telescope. The work is expected to lead to discoveries of rare objects that will be used as laboratories for basic physics and astrophysics to probe the equation of state of nuclear matter, gravity in compact, high-mass binaries, and gravitational-wave backgrounds. Discoveries may include the first black-hole/neutron-star binary, which would allow unprecedented studies of gravity in the strong-field limit. The large sample of new pulsars, when combined with existing ones, will contribute to the understanding of neutron stars as end products of stellar evolution, and will enable state-of-the-art modeling of the Milky Way Galaxy with respect to its ionized components. Also, use of the large number of pulsars as tracers will allow delineation of some ambiguously defined spiral arms of the Galaxy.     The ultimate goals of the project will be enabled by the availability in 2008 of a new spectrometer that utilizes the full capabilities of the 7-beam system at Arecibo, and the availability of computer and data storage systems that can process and archive the large volume of data generated. Specific tasks include developmental activities related to the commissioning at Arecibo of the large bandwidth spectrometer, the setting up of the infrastructure required to analyze the data, and the intensive data analysis required to find new pulsars, all of which will be conducted in collaboration with the Pulsar ALFA Consortium, an international group of about 30 researchers. Over the 3-year project, about 1000 Terabytes of data will be analyzed using several computer clusters. Post-discovery studies will include timing campaigns and multiwavelength observations. A web-based system will provide access to source catalogs, timing models, and intermediate data products that can be used as a resource for synergistic studies. Raw data will be archived for long-term data mining applications and use in multiwavelength campaigns, such as future gamma-ray space telescope observations that require radio counterpart observations.    The large data volume requires development of data management for streamlined analysis, archival and retrieval. The project therefore serves as a prototype for future data-intensive surveys in astronomy, and will enable eventual connection to multi-user facilities such as national and international virtual observatories.

Native fishes are declining in these streams; thus, understanding the effects of their loss is vital.      To assess how environmental context affects species interactions in Southwestern streams, this study will investigate the influence of two related, but functionally different fish species, Catostomus insignis and Catostomus clarki, on ecosystem processes along an elevational gradient.  This gradient will enable examination of the effects of these species on critical stream processes such as primary production and organic matter generation under conditions ranging from warm water, low desert streams to cool water, high mountain streams.  Using large-scale enclosures controlling fish identity in a single stream combined with small-scale fish exclosures in multiple streams, this study will estimate the effects of fish on ecosystem properties, and assess how environmental context modifies them.  The project also will track fish habitat use to understand if effects on ecosystem processes are heterogeneous within the stream.  Understanding the factors modifying species importance in ecosystems will provide information particularly valuable for management agencies, which must develop sustainable practices to use and protect these ecological resources."

About 15 years ago, terabyte datasets were still considered `ridiculous.' However, modern datasets managed by Stanford Linear Acceleration Center (SLAC), NASA, NSA, etc. have reached the perabyte scale or larger. Corporations such as Amazon, Wal-Mart, Ebay, and search engine firms are also major generators and users of massive data. The general theme of data reduction and summarization has become an active and highly inter-disciplinary area of research. This project proposes to develop various approximation techniques, which generate a \"fingerprint\" or \"sketch\" of the massive data by transforming the original data. These `sketches' are reasonably small (hence easy to store) and can provide approximate answers which are usually good enough for practical purposes.     This proposal concerns the fundamental problems of processing/transforming massive (possibly dynamic) data. In particular, it focuses on (A) developing systematic fundamental tools for effective data reduction and efficient data summarization; (B) applying these tools to improve numerical analysis, visualization, and exploratory data analysis.  Two lines of theoretically sound techniques for data reduction and summarization will be developed and further improved: (1) the method of stable random projections (SRP), effective in heavy-tailed data; (2) the method of Conditional Random Sampling (CRS), mainly for sparse data. Concrete applications of SRP and CRS will be investigated. Widely-used basic numerical algorithms can be rewritten by taking advantage of SRP or CRS. Popular methods/tools for exploratory data analysis will also benefit considerably from the development of data reduction techniques."

The non-intrusive stochastic multiscale framework being developed has three key components: (a) A computational framework that encodes the limited information available about the variability of the (multiscale) material properties (permeability) into a reduced-order stochastic input model, (b) An adaptive sparse grid collocation framework for solving the stochastic PDEs involved and (c) A mathematically consistent strategy to exchange information across length scales for the solution of stochastic multiscale problems.  The key concept explored in the data-driven reduced-order stochastic input model construction is the low-dimensional parametrization of manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces. The sparse grid collocation approach constructs the stochastic solution solely based on function calls to the corresponding deterministic physical simulator. The framework is based on hierarchical basis functions in multiple dimensions. Adaptivity and convergence are ensured by utilizing a local support while scalability is guaranteed by the careful choice of appropriate data structures. The information transfer strategies are based on the decoupled structure of the stochastic and multiscale algorithms.

Thermal and hydrodynamic transport in random heterogeneous media are ubiquitous processes occurring in various scales ranging from the large scale (e.g. geothermal energy systems, oil recovery, geological heating of the earth?s crust) to smaller scales (e.g. heat transfer through composites, polycrystals, flow through pores, inter-dendritic flow in solidification, heat transfer through fluidized beds). There has been increasing scientific, technological and economic interests in predictive modeling of the thermal and hydrodynamic behavior of such media. In addition, this work can be valuable in understanding other systems that are poorly understood and/or controlled due to the gappy and inaccurate data available for their description.

In addition to his research work, Prof. Davis proposes to continue his development of inexpensive spectrophotometers (ca. $50) for use in high schools, along with curricular materials to go with them.    Transition metal-containing species catalyze a large number of industrial processes.  The ultimate goal of research like that of Prof. Davis is to develop a better understanding of how metal atoms react in these processes.  A better understanding of these reactions should lead to better processes.  In addition to the broader impact of the proposed research work, Prof. Davis' work in developing rugged, inexpensive laboratory equipment will help to bring science experiments to schools, here and abroad, which operate with limited resources.  The graduate and undergraduate research students supported on this award will also enter the technical workforce with superb training in chemistry, physics and modern laboratory science."

It       was developed by Daniel Grayson and Michael Stillman with NSF funding.       Grayson and Stillman will continue the development of Macaulay2.  They       will upgrade existing algorithms, develop and publish new algorithms, and       implement new algorithms. In particular, they will develop the interaction       of the symbolic computations that are Macaulay2's strength with the new       floating point algorithms in algebraic geometry that are now being       developed by Andrew Sommese, Jan Verschelde, Anton Leykin, Frank Schreyer       and others.  It is anticipated that these will make a whole new class of       problems accessible to experimentation and, in many cases, solution.       Eisenbud will organize contacts for the extended integration with other       systems and will engage other mathematicians in the development work that       needs to be done.  Central to the project are the continued expansion of       the collaborations that have been the hallmark of Macaulay2 development.       For this purpose two Macaulay2 Workgroup Meetings will be held in the       course of the two-year grant.  One particular research problem to be       attacked is: the use of computational systems to (probabilistically)       disprove, or suggest a proof of, the Jacobian Conjecture on polynomial       automorphisms of affine spaces (this will require the use the new floating       point algorithms).  Other areas where new algorithms can make an impact       include the study of numerical systems, fractions with specified types of       denominators, ideal factorization, systems where the multiplication of the       variables doesn't satisfy the commutative law, geometric optimization, the       analysis of observations of gene expression levels over time, and       bioinformatics.           Macaulay2 is part of the infrastructure that supports mathematical       research involving systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  The       study of such systems of polynomial equations is central in pure and       applied mathematics and in physics, with recent new impacts in such fields       as cryptography, robotics and string theory.  Increasing computer power       and the availability of programs like Macaulay2 are making a new level of       experimentation possible.  The experimental results found with Macaulay2       are helping in the formulation and development of tractable conjectures in       mathematics as well as in physics. A measure of Macaulay2's impact is that       at least 270 research papers have cited Macaulay2, several mathematicians       have contributed code, and books and course materials are now using it.       The PI's will develop the software further and will recruit developers       from the research community.  They will introduce graduate students and       mathematicians to the use of computers in research mathematics and the       requisite skills in programming and development of algorithms, through       workgroups at Berkeley and through the appointments of graduate students       as graduate assistants."

Assessing image fidelity is an important aspect of realistic imaging that has broad implications in both computer graphics and digital photography.  Recently perceptual metrics based on computational models of human vision have been used to characterize image fidelity; but these metrics typically characterize pixel-wise image differences. When we look at images we don?t see pixels, we see objects with distinct shapes, sizes, materials, and motions.  Therefore, there is a need for image fidelity metrics that characterize the appearance properties of objects. This project introduces a new standard for image fidelity called visual equivalence. Images are visually equivalent if they convey the same information about object appearance (shape, material, lighting), even if they are different pixel-by-pixel. This new standard fundamentally expands the scope of how to assess image fidelity, providing a metric that is based on higher-level properties of visual coding.    This project seeks to understand and leverage the phenomenon of visual equivalence by: a) conducting a series of psychophysical experiments that develop a foundation for  visual  equivalence by exploring interactions between the geometry, material and illumination properties of objects in complex scenes;  b) developing visual equivalence predictors that apply to a wide range of scenes; and c) demonstrating the practical utility of the concept of visual equivalence in a range of applications including high-fidelity environment map compression and scalable rendering of complex scenes. The products of this research provide valuable new tools for addressing one of the grand challenges in computer graphics:  the high performance, high fidelity image synthesis of complex scenes.  Further, this new approach to image fidelity should have a significant impact beyond graphics in areas including 2d and 3d digital image acquisition, coding, compression, transmission, storage, and display."

Under this scenario of dynamic heterogeneity, the achieved PPE will vary significantly depending on what applications run on which degraded cores.  For some assignments of threads to cores, the degradation may be so severe as to render the system unusable.  However, the large problem size precludes straightforward search techniques.    This problem is addressed through a judicious combination of design-time analysis and runtime measurements coupled with a hierarchical rules-based search algorithm.  The algorithm operates at two levels, with the lowest level divided among subgroups of cores. Design time information regarding the characteristics of cores in different degraded states helps prune the search space, while runtime measurements provide feedback about the ``goodness'' of the solution. The result will be a workable solution for future large-scale, highly uncertain CMPs that permits maintaining as close to the peak PPE as possible.  The broader impacts of this research involve integrated research and education, broadening the participation of under-represented groups, enhanced infrastructure for research, broad dissemination of results, and potential societal impact."

However, people often behave in predictable and systematic ways that are inconsistent with utility maximization models of decision theory.  Moreover, players who follow the recommendations of game theory will do far worse than those who do not. These predictive failures of current theories stem from a number of sources, including:    1) current theories implicitly assume that agents are perfect reasoners, who can compute the consequences of their actions;    2) current solution concepts assume that computation is free, so do not take into account the cost of computation;    3) equilibrium concepts implicitly assume that agents know what all other agents are doing;    4) current approaches do not take language into account - they implicitly assume that all agents playing a game (or making a decision) describe the game (or decision problem) the same way, and have the same theory of the world;    5) all agents are assumed to be rational, according to the modeler of the game/decision problem.    Most of these observations are not new (references to previous work are provided in later sections). The time is now ripe to put all these observations together and come up with more realistic foundations for game theory and decision theory. The goal of this project is to construct such a foundation, by using a broad range of techniques from logic, cryptography, and robust distributed computing, and then apply the ideas to the problem of robust mechanism design (i.e., rules for making choices).    The project explores new research directions in both computer science and game theory, and the resulting synthesis should enrich both fields. It should have a broader societal impact as well, including more robust design of mechanisms for auctions; better design of peer-to-peer networks; more secure wireless networks; better software agents, that make decisions more comprehensible to users and that take into better account the actions of other users; and, more generally, a deeper understanding of the actions of interacting agents."

Probabilistic databases are expected to allow for new data   management applications to arise that currently require substantial   bootstrapping and development effort, if they are feasible at all.   Probabilistic databases allow for very flexible ways of representing and   managing incompleteness and are a possible foundation for a new breed of   more encompassing and powerful data integration systems. Probabilistic   databases could give rise to more effective, lazy integration systems, in   which the input is initially inserted into the database with a high degree   of uncertainty, which is subsequently reduced using various forms of   corpus data, evidence, and probabilistic mappings and rules.    The primary goal of this project is to perform foundational research and   develop a probabilistic database management system that can support such   applications. The first aim of this project is to work on efficient query   processing techniques, with a particular focus on the essential problems   of computing tuple confidence values and the closely related problem of   conditioning a probabilistic database. Both are known to be   computationally hard, and efficient techniques are expected to have to   make use of the state of the art in algorithms for constraint   satisfaction. In some applications, such as ad-hoc query processing for   decision support, exact query results are not necessary. Previous work has   pointed out efficient approximation techniques for simple queries, namely   for the ranked retrieval of results of conjunctive queries together with   their confidences; however, there is currently no work on approximating   queries that themselves make use of confidence values, for example in   selection operations.     Approximating expressive, compositional queries on   probabilistic databases is a second main focus of the planned project.   Thirdly, nearly all previous work on probabilistic databases has focussed   on designing representation systems and query languages and laying the   foundations for efficient query processing. For real data management   applications to use probabilistic database systems in the future, it must   also be possible to update such databases, and to run transactional   programs on them. While no work on this exists in the literature,   uncertainty in the data poses a number of fundamental challenges to be   addressed as the third main aim of the project.

Species as diverse as algae, annual plants, birds, fishes, insects, and sheep have quickly undergone evolutionary changes when their environments change or when they invade a new habitat. This project will use mathematical and statistical studies of model ecological food webs to understand how the coupling of ecology and evolution affects the temporal dynamics of species and their ability to persist in ever-changing environments, and how loss of genetic variability and the capacity for rapid evolutionary response may affect the robustness and stability of ecological systems. Statistical methods based on techniques for estimating smooth functions will be developed to infer evolutionary dynamics from observational population data such as ongoing monitoring of harvested or threatened species.     Becoming somebody's dinner, or the factory for replicating a virus, is very strong natural selection. It is hard to imagine these occurring without immediate evolutionary consequences, but exactly that thinking is embedded in the ecological theory now underpinning environmental and natural resource management. Implications of this research are therefore extremely broad, including resource management, biodiversity conservation, invasive species management, and ecosystem responses to environmental change. Broader impacts also include training graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and using established contacts with environmental agencies to promote consideration of evolutionary dynamics in conservation planning and response to changing environments."

The PI will also study vortex-induced vibration, and dynamics of flying objects, as well as freely rising and falling bodies. Two exploratory research investigations that should deliver quite powerful and general tools are:  firstly, an efficient method to generate multiple vortices, possibly in the presence of solid bodies or a wall; and secondly, building a \"Virtual Unsteady Dynamics Facility.\" Concerning the first approach, rather than observe vorticity distributions after the fact, the PI will determine how to move a body, relative to a fluid, to deliver a pre-determined vortex configuration - in short to actually design a vortex configuration. A key to this idea is to devise a model of the vortex formation from sharp-edged bodies. The approach involves translating a vertical airfoil in a horizontal plane (like one uses a giant XY plotter), employing the Cornell computer-controlled XY Towing Tank. An immediate application, where this approach is urgently needed is that of vortex configurations applicable to aircraft trailing vortex wakes, including counter-rotating or co-rotating vortex interactions, and their interaction with the ground. The second approach involves development of a Virtual Unsteady Dynamics Facility, which will allow a body in the fluid to move as though it were elastically-restrained; the structural stiffness, damping and mass are represented in software within a computer, while the fluid forces and moments on the body are those actually measured from the physical body. The motion of the body is computer-controlled by the towing tank carriage system, following the equations of motion represented in the software. The PI can experiment with freely rising and falling bodies by representing gravity as a horizontal force! Direct comparison can be made with some existing experiments studying free dynamics of spherical and cylindrical bodies. Flutter of falling bodies such as plates can be studied with a view to understanding tumbling and rocking modes in terms of the vortex dynamics and stall. The PI has involved 177 students in his research laboratories from 1990-2007, and his involvement with undergraduates, including minority undergraduates, will continue with this project.

Understanding the evolutionary history of social behavior in apid bees requires a phylogeny at the tribal and generic levels. However, currently a clear understanding of the phylogeny of this group is lacking because different data sets provide highly conflicting results.

This project will combine data from morphology, the fossil record, and large molecular data sets generated with novel 454 Lifesciences sequencing technology to resolve the conflicting results obtained by previous studies. The research will allow a re-assessment of the morphological data, and are-examination of apid fossils from Dominican, Baltic, and North American amber deposits.

The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian populations worldwide.    This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute to the response to novel disease threats. This research will quantify the molecular effects of this disease in ?real-time?, in addition to the genetic determinants of survivorship, resulting in useful epidemiological predictions for other populations or species that have yet to be exposed to the disease."

This phenomenon, known as mast-fruiting or masting behavior, is believed to be driven by either environmental forcing or pollination coupling. Environmental forcing postulates that trees use weather as a cue to determine the resources they devote to reproduction in a particular year. Pollen coupling assumes that pollen is limited and that fertilization efficiency is dependent on pollen production by nearby trees. This proposal will test these hypotheses using long-term data on acorn production by Q. lobata collected on a statewide scale combined with detailed data on individual phenology, microclimate, overall pollen abundance, and the fate of female flowers.     	The project will collect statewide data on acorn production, a highly variable food resource important to both game and non-game wildlife. The project focuses on a tree species of considerable conservation interest because of development, habitat conversion, apparent lack of regeneration, and susceptibility to future climate change. The work proposed here will help to emphasize the key role Q. lobata and oak woodlands in general play as a natural resource important both to wildlife and to ecosystem function. The extensive dataset on seed production by forest trees that will result from this research will be made electronically available, first in summary form and ultimately as metadata, for future researchers interesting in using the data to examine patterns and test hypotheses regarding the ecology and evolution of masting behavior."

The mormyrids are a diverse group of fishes from Africa that communicate using species-specific electric organ discharges (EODs) that are essential for species recognition. However, some species are polymorphic, with different individuals having distinct EOD forms and correspondingly different electric organ morphology. This project will focus on the polymorphic species Paramormyrops kingsleyae as a microcosm of electric signal evolution throughout the mormyrids. The researchers will use a combination of field work, molecular genetic techniques, electrophysiology, and behavioral playback experiments to determine the genetic basis for electric signal diversity in P. kingsleyae, and the importance of this diversity in driving reproductive isolation between populations and adapting different populations to their particular environments. The results of these studies will lead to specific hypotheses about the root causes of electric signal diversification throughout the mormyrids, which the researchers will test using similar techniques across a wide range of species. This research will prove broadly applicable by providing a mechanistic understanding of how animal communication signals diversify, as well as insight into the ultimate causes for this diversification and the resulting consequences for speciation and the evolution of communication behavior.   Broader impacts: The project includes an educational outreach program for public school students, which uses electric fish to provide hands-on demonstrations for linking basic concepts in the physical sciences and biology.

Using experimental procedures to be conducted at Cornell University, the investigators will compare subjects? evaluations of workers? files in situations where the law prohibits discrimination and situations in which no law is in place.  The main hypothesis is that laws that protect leave takers from discrimination will not only reduce discriminatory outcomes but also produce more positive evaluations of these workers.  The findings from this study will make important contributions to understanding whether laws can change both behavior and normative belief systems.  Results could also provide scholars with new knowledge and information to understand whether employers will penalize workers when they defy stereotypes that women should be family caretakers and men should be family breadwinners.  Theoretically, the project will collect new data to illuminate whether normative discrimination -- whereby employers discriminate because they believe that mothers should stay at home with their children and fathers should support the family ? is widespread or contingent.  This project offers several broader benefits.  First, the social benefits to workers and families of identifying effective legal reforms are potentially enormous; one estimate is that caretaker bias costs mothers as much as $1 million over the course of their careers.  Second, the project will give both undergraduate and graduate students first-hand experience conducting empirical research.  From past experience, the investigators expect that up to half of these students will be women and/or minorities, increasing the likelihood that these students will pursue scientific careers.  Finally, this project will not only establish a new, interdisciplinary collaboration between UC Berkeley and Cornell, but will also reach out to other innovative organizations focused on work and family issues."

Shaw, IOS-0818862:  The genetics of female acoustic preference behavior.	    New species may be formed by changes in the signals that precede mating.  In several well known clusters of species, divergent mating signals appear to be a primary reason why closely related species remain distinct.  This sort of evolutionary change is poorly understood.  One hypothesis is that the genes for male mating signals are the same as those for female response (or preference).  This study focuses on Laupala, a group of closely related cricket species that has diverged very rapidly.  Like most crickets, Laupala communicate acoustically, and acoustic differences contribute to mating incompatibility between species.  However, some species can be hybridized in the laboratory, enabling a genetic study of these differences.  Two closely related species that differ markedly in male song and female preference will be hybridized.  Hybrid offspring will be mated with one of these species for several generations to move preference and song genes from one species into the other.  Molecular markers will be used to produce a genome map of the location of genes underlying song and preference.  With this map, it will be possible to ascertain whether song and preference genes map to the same location and how much each gene contributes to differences between species.  The number of molecular markers on this map will subsequently be increased to facilitate the eventual cloning of genes underlying song and preference.    Research and education are integrated by training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. Kamehameha Schools students will be involved by establishing a web-based science lab analyzing the genetics of song and preference inheritance.  The P.

In state legislative elections, there is a growing tendency for states to directly subsidize candidates who agree to abide by pre-set spending limits.  Despite the growing ubiquity of large subsidies and well-defined spending limits, political scientists have not fully considered the impact of these systems on campaign dynamics.  Much previous analysis of public funding has assumed that the infusion of money holds the potential to create more competitive elections, but little has been discovered regarding the causal chain between subsidy and competition.      This project focuses on the relationship between public money and how candidates spend their time engaging voters, and on whether altered campaign dynamics translate to changes in voter behavior.  Using survey and interview data from candidates in twelve states, a theory of voter mobilization in publicly funded elections is developed and tested.  The theory posits that publicly-funded candidates spend more time engaging voters.  At the same time, it predicts that interest groups unable to influence elections monetarily will directly support mobilization efforts.  In short, voters in publicly-funded elections are more likely to be mobilized, leading to higher levels of efficacy, knowledge, and participation.      Survey data will be supplemented with election returns, turnout statistics, and campaign finance disclosures.  Various statistical models will be used to analyze the effect public money has upon candidate entry, time allocations, and voter mobilization.  Quantitative findings will be supported with qualitative candidate interviews.    This research will advance political scientists? understanding of the manner in which public election financing changes campaign dynamics.  First, the analysis transcends election statistics, incorporating the strategic and emotional concerns of candidates.  Second, the project considers the affects of this altered strategic environment on political elites, groups, and the electorate at large.  Suggesting that public election financing changes strategy and emotion system-wide, the theory broadens the criteria with which public financing will be evaluated.  The project also extends current research methodologically, employing a mixed methods approach focused on political actors in publicly-funded systems.    Finally, this research supports the broader academic and policy communities. Several states are seriously considering the implementation of public funding for future elections.  Understanding the manner in which public financing changes election strategy and voter mobilization is of paramount importance as these deliberations continue. The project will provide the most complete picture to date of how political actors and voters respond to the availability of public election subsidies."

This award will support travel for graduate student participants, and the workshop will include a session for poster presentations. Selected papers will be published in an edited volume.    The workshop will be of importance to two disciplinary areas and groups of researchers. The first is the community of linguists (and scholars in related fields such as psychology and cognitive science) who study language as a formal system. This conference will help make the community aware of the importance of issues related to language change. The second impacted group is the community of scholars involved in the historical/comparative study of the Indo-European family. This is a small but traditionally influential group of scholars within the larger field of historical/comparative linguistics. The conference and ensuing publication will serve to bring these scholars into contact with generative work on syntactic change, and vice versa."

In light of predicted climate change, the soil?s ability to accumulate and retain C has received growing interest. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change demands a fundamental understanding of mechanisms that control C stabilization and release from soils. Yet, the underlying geobiological mechanisms for the long-term stabilization of C in soils are still not well understood, and the potential for C sequestration in the uppermost layers of the Earth?s surface remains unknown. Current conceptual models of soil organic C turnover build on destructive macroscopic analytical approaches are not fully process-oriented, and usually fail to provide explicit molecular-level information about the linkage between mineralogy and organic C functionalities, as well as the spatial features of organomineral assemblages. The objective of the proposed project is to design novel experimental and non-destructive high resolution spectromicroscopic (STXM and NEXAFS) approaches that enable us to obtain first-hand process-oriented biogeochemical evidence regarding: (i) the in situ spatial arrangement of minerals, polyvalent metal-ions, organic C functionalities and other architectural features of organomineral assemblages at the microscopic and sub-microscopic level, and (ii) element-specific information about local structural and compositional environments of adsorbing atoms and surficial interactions, micro- and nano-scale heterogeneity in spatial allocations and other molecular-level features of organomineral assemblages. Of particular interest are the long-term changes along a mineralogical gradient developed during pedogenesis. We plan to conduct the proposed investigation on samples that will be collected from a long-term soil chronosequence at Merced-California, where the underlying geomorphologic units range in age from 3 to 3000 Kyr.     Intellectual merit: This project aims to develop innovative analytical approaches involving the use of synchrotron-based direct microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. These novel methods will reveal high-resolution information on a molecular- and atomic-level providing a detailed mechanistic understanding of organic C stabilization due to spatial organization and surficial biogeochemical interactions. This project will be the first of its kind and advance knowledge about long-term stabilization of organic C and global biogeochemical C cycling driven by the complex interaction of C, soil minerals and the emergent soil properties in the critical zone. For the broader scientific community, project outcomes will significantly strengthen climate change and environmental research of Earth?s C cycles.     Broader impacts: This project will build local capacity in teaching, learning and research. Students at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels will be trained using a wide array of new technologies and their applications. A particular effort will be made to actively recruit non-traditional, minority and female students. The innovative nature of the analytical approach affords the possibility of developing a short collaborative hands-on training program on ?The potentials and applications of synchrotron-based infrared and X-ray spectromicroscopic techniques in environmental geobiology? to environmental scientists who are at early stage of career development.

During transcription, RNA polymerase is known to transcribe against DNA supercoiling. The mechanism by which RNA polymerase carries out transcription under torsional stress remains one of the most fundamental and intriguing problems in biology. The PI's lab will carry out a comprehensive set of single molecule experiments to investigate the regulation of E. coli RNA polymerase under a well-defined applied torque using an angular optical trap that has been developed in the PI's lab.

This project would advance knowledge along both dimensions.  The difficulty of isolating exogenous individual separation events has led the literature to use separations that encompass multiple worker layoffs at the same time (mass layoffs) as the exogenous event upon which to base estimates of the earnings loss associated with an involuntary change of employers. Thus, the job losses associated with mass layoffs are a convenient natural experiment for investigating outcomes whose measurement would otherwise be biased by endogeneity of the separation. In previous research (McKinney and Vilhuber, 2006; Lengermann and Vilhuber, 2002; Abowd, McKinney and Vilhuber, 2008; Bowlus and Vilhuber, 2002), the investigators have found some evidence that the mass layoff event is related to characteristics of the workers employed at the firm. This project would continue that research, investigating whether the mass layoff event can be considered statistically exogenous for the worker and, if not in general, under what circumstances the exogeneity assumption can be maintained.  Second, the previous literature has used survey-based person and/or household panels, or administrative data for individual US states to investigate these issues. While providing detailed demographic information, surveys are often limited by the number of workers actually observed as part of a mass layoff, restricting the analysis of specific sub-groups and limiting the extent to which geographic or firm-level information can be incorporated into the analysis. In the past, users of administrative data have been restricted to using a single geographic entity, not being able to follow workers across political boundaries, and have not had access to much information on worker or firm characteristics.    This project would address some of those shortcomings by using the Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program Infrastructure file system, covering more than 98% of private employment in 46 states as of January 2008 (with 31 states available for research purposes), which have been linked to select detailed demographic information on workers, and detailed firm-level information, using survey and census data available at the U.S. Census Bureau. This project explores and exploits detailed geographic variation, investigates and uses geographic mobility across state borders, and incorporates worker and firm level characteristics into the unique longitudinal aspect and quasi-universal coverage of administrative datasets. The project also provides newer and updated information on states that have been analyzed previously. It leverages the magnitude of the dataset to explore alternate measures of mass layoffs, highlighting the possible sensitivity of the results to the choice of particular measures of mass layoffs. Besides providing updated results, the wealth of information allows the investigator us to determine how one measures an event (or different events) ties directly into the question of the exogeneity of the layoff, as does the cause of the mass layoff event itself. The ability to define a number of new measures, to expand outcome measures beyond the original location of the worker, and to subset the analysis by detailed demographic and firm characteristics, including geography, helps to check the robustness of any inference made about earnings losses of workers.    Broader Impacts. The economic impact of job losses on workers, in particular those resulting from large mass layoffs, can be substantial. Workers may experience earnings 10 to 20 percent below normal earnings levels even five years or longer after losing a job. Accurately measuring the cost of job loss is policy relevant and has motivated regulations and laws to mitigate or alleviate these losses. Assessing the cost of such laws depends critically on both the estimated loss by each affected worker and the estimated incidence of exogenous job loss."

Visualization is a term used in science and technology studies (STS) to describe the material and social process of making research objects visible, analyzable, and communicable. The study of visualization includes the analysis of publicly presented images and textual illustrations, but it also includes laboratory practices and instruments that create images from data. Consequently, a requirement for studying visualization is to retrace the pathways through which data are transformed into images, and candidate images are chosen for specific purposes.    Images of nanoscale phenomena (\"nano-images\") are of particular interest for two principal reasons.   (1) Nano-images are said to be created through manipulation, and they have no clear relation to independently observable entities. Nevertheless, they are composed as visible configurations of shape and color that evoke familiar landscapes and discernable patterns, while laying claim to a future of what can be seen and/or built at the nanoscale.   (2) Nano-images and image galleries appear to have a leading role in the promotion of nanoscience and technology as part of a broad-based movement in science and industry. This raises the question of what, if any, relation the popularized images have to visualization of nanoscale phenomena at the research front.     Selected science and engineering laboratories are studied primarily at Cornell University for the purpose of learning about how images are produced for different purposes and audiences. Open-ended interviews with laboratory researchers and relevant technical staff focus on specific images and sequences of image-processing work. Examples of images of different kinds are collected and examined for the way they deploy visual rhetoric for specific analytical and presentational purposes.      The research contributes to STS scholarship on visualization in science, and to a rapidly growing interest in the use and display of images in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The project emphasizes the practical and epistemic importance of visual phenomena and material culture. It sheds light on the various types of nano-image, and examines whether and how they represent novel relations to objects of study and to different audiences.    The project supplements ongoing research and training at Cornell University on ethical, legal, and social aspects of emerging technologies. The research also contributes to a book (tentatively titled Images in Science) designed for undergraduate and graduate level teaching in history, STS, visual studies, and other fields."

By combining technical expertise in membrane biophysics, chemistry, and engineering with broad educational goals and outreach efforts, this program is poised to advance our fundamental understanding of physical-chemical effects on electrophoretic separations in supported lipid bilayers while preparing students for careers as scientists and engineers with an appreciation for and commitment to diversity.     The research objective is to develop and understand the mechanisms of separation of membrane species by bilayer electrophoresis and then to create devices that integrate separation of cellular species with various unit operations on chip. The hypothesis is that biomolecular separations in membrane platforms can occur by three mechanisms: 1) differential partitioning of the components in and out of the bilayer and bulk aqueous phase, facilitated by bilayer chemistry or temperature, 2) preferential partitioning of one species into lipid rafts while the other stays outside, and 3) by hydrodynamic effects caused by obstacles in an otherwise fluid bilayer. Insight gained from these studies will be used to optimize separations of more complex species i.e., peripheral proteins, and eventually, transmembrane species.     The approach is to formulate bilayers of various compositions and properties then measure the diffusion, mobility, and separation efficiency of membrane components within it. Previous studies showed that reducing mobility leads to better separations. Therefore, separations could be enhanced by reducing diffusion in the bilayer by adding sterols or reducing temperature, component interactions with lipid rafts, and adding hydrodynamic obstacles of various sizes and concentrations, as all of these have been shown to reduce mobility of membrane species. An evaluation of these new strategies and the details of the mechanisms of separation are currently unknown and are necessary to optimize separation resolution. Separations inside microfluidic channels coated with bilayers will be integrated with 2D protein crystallization and chemical interaction assays. This prototype device will be a stepping stone towards future structure-function studies of proteins and lipids in a native-like environment.     The broader impact of the proposed activities is its potential to transform the state-of-the-art in membrane proteomics by creating a biomimetic platform for rapid screening of membrane protein and lipid chemical activity, membrane protein crystal formation, and structure determination in order to understand biological function and streamline drug development. The educational objective is to create ways to make science and engineering more inclusive to underrepresented groups through development of outreach programs and innovation in the classroom. To achieve this goal, interactive laboratory projects will be developed and implemented during two of Cornell's diversity programs: CATALYST (a summer camp in science and engineering) and the Diversity and Prospective Women's Weekends, both programs targeting high school students. Active recruitment to engineering and mentoring of students will occur during these events with full participation of the research group. In an effort to retain more students in engineering, the Materials and Energy Balances core course will be modernized to reflect current teaching and learning styles and incorporate interactive web-based tools to increase the learning of all students. The research and education plan are integrated carefully so that diversity within engineering is increased and this diversity brings value the students, the research effort, and to society."

Evidence suggests that the Purkinje network may be involved during ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and it is known that Purkinje cells can exhibit period-doubling bifurcations, enhanced normal automaticity, abnormal automaticity and triggered activity that may be proarrhythmic. However, direct evidence for Purkinje involvement in ventricular fibrillation is difficult to obtain experimentally at resolutions that would allow the matter to be settled definitively.  The PI will investigate Purkinje dynamics during fibrillation using mathematical modeling and simulation, an approach that has been a useful tool for many years to study cardiac dynamics and mechanisms of arrhythmias over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  The approach will encompass three specific aims: 1) create a detailed mathematical model of the canine Purkinje cell using ion current measurements; 2) develop a detailed model of canine ventricular anatomy, including a realistic Purkinje network; and 3) determine the contribution of Purkinje fibers during ventricular fibrillation in the canine heart.  The newly developed Purkinje model, together with the new canine ventricular anatomy with Purkinje network, will provide a novel tool to assess the contribution of the Purkinje system during induced arrhythmias.  Identification of Purkinje fiber contributions to arrhythmia development or evolution may lead to new avenues of treatment in the future.  Furthermore, all results will be made available to other researchers and to the general public via the PI?s website, which is already established as a leading source of information about the heart and cardiac modeling. This basic research has the potential to have a significant impact on future biomedical research by providing an additional means to study ventricular arrhythmias and by suggesting a possible new approach for treating cardiac disease.     The research will help to improve diversity in engineering by directly supporting a female investigator and a female graduate student. It will also help to integrate research with both formal and informal education through classroom teaching and dissemination of information via a web site, with a special emphasis on interactive programs and animations. Web-site visualization tools will enhance infrastructure for research and education. Results available via web sites, participation in multidisciplinary conferences, and integration of research and education activities will promote broad dissemination of information. In addition, the improved understanding of the contributions of Purkinje fibers during ventricular arrhythmias may lead to future advances in arrhythmia treatment.    This BRIGE grant will broaden the participation of and increase opportunities for all engineers including those from groups underrepresented in the engineering disciplines.  This BRIGE grant will also encourage the PI to become actively and competitively engaged in research as an independent investigator."

Overwork is increasingly common as an established norm in the workplace, especially in high-skilled jobs. Those who work long hours are perceived to be more committed to their jobs and rewarded by higher income and more frequent promotions, while those who work fewer hours are penalized for being less committed to their jobs. This project seeks to identify whether this overwork phenomenon systematically disadvantages women, who are less likely to work longer hours because of the normative expectation that they will have more caregiving responsibilities than men. To this end, this research will use longitudinal data drawn from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and a cross sectional dataset drawn from the Current Population Survey (CPS).  The project will employ quantitative methods to conduct three empirical analyses that assess whether spousal overwork affects men and women?s employment differently; whether overwork affects women?s occupational mobility; and whether overwork exacerbates the gender gap in earnings.  This study will help us to understand whether gender inequality in various arenas perpetuates through the interaction between the gendered workplace and deeply engrained gendered norms in the family. This will shed light on sources of occupational sex segregation.  By examining the gendered consequences of the overwork phenomenon, this study will contribute to identifying whether discriminatory factors are hidden in the overwork culture, an issue that connects to women?s status in the labor market."

Examples are many. Fashion good retailers make stocking decisions for clothing items that act as substitutes. Airlines price millions of itinerary products that use the aircraft capacities over the same airline network. Health clinics allocate appointment and operating room slots to the patients with different priorities. Despite the recurrent nature of these asset management problems, the optimization models and algorithms for simultaneously managing the inventories of multiple perishable assets are largely limited to either deterministic approaches that ignore the uncertainty altogether or static approaches that ignore the evolution of the system over time. This grant provides funding for the development of sophisticated models and algorithms for large-scale perishable asset management problems that arise in a variety of settings.    The results of this research will be particularly useful for pricing, capacity allocation, product assembly and revenue management problems. The goal is to develop optimization models and algorithms that (i) appropriately capture the randomness in the system, (ii) scale easily to handle realistic problem sizes, (iii) apply independent of the particular application setting, (iv) provide performance guarantees, and (v) make reasonable assumptions about data availability. The plan is to demonstrate that asset management problems share common features and one can develop a unified approach for them. The course offerings on decision-making under uncertainty will significantly benefit from this research. Management simulation games, which put the students in command of a realistic asset management scenario, will be programmed and incorporated into the courses. High school and undergraduate students will gain early research experience. Data sets for pricing and revenue management problems will be developed and made available to the research community."

This is consistent with the well-known shift of the U.S. economy from a manufacturing base to a service base. The proposed research is to study the dynamic control of service systems with three major innovations: upgrades, reneging, and retrials. Although the motivation in each case stems from call centers, the results obtained will be applicable more generally. The following questions are to be considered:    ?	After market segmentation, are there simple modifications to classic resource allocation policies that can reduce waiting times for lower class customers, while guaranteeing high quality service for higher class customers?  ?	Do the insights drawn from classic allocation policies continue to be useful in the advanced systems of today?  ?	In models with controlled the admission rates, are there simple, implementable policies given today's new decision-making paradigms?    To tackle each of these questions specific models of service systems are presented. Each model presents new challenges from both a theoretical and managerial standpoint. If successful, insights into optimal resource allocation in service systems will be provided as well as opening the door for new exploration of service system control.    The intellectual merits of our proposed research include examining extensions of some of the classic models in scheduling and admission control. These extensions stand to update the state of the art to cover more recent innovations in service systems and answer new paradigms introduced in the current service economy of the United States. In some cases we expect that the insights gained can serve as a warning against blindly  using classic results as the models become more intricate. Indeed, the proposed models are not even proposed the most general possible, yet the insights even so far are profound.

Decisions to trust constitute a necessary element for the development of stable partnerships and societies. Yet, in the face of the many benefits that come with delayed exchanges, the decision to trust another is often a precarious one. The individual who first extends effort or provides resources is necessarily in the unenviable position of risking that the other will not reciprocate. Consequently, adaptive functioning relies not only on trusting others, but also on the ability to decide if one's partner is worthy of trust. Interestingly, however, previous efforts designed to uncover the signals of trustworthiness have been relatively unsuccessful. Building off initial research by members of the project team which demonstrates that trustworthiness of new partners can be discerned at greater than chance levels, the current project explores a novel route by which individuals may assesses the intentions of potential partners. Rather than looking for specific cues to trustworthiness in isolation, the process of assessing trust will be reconceptualized as a dynamic and iterative one. In short, the project will examine whether decisions to trust are not based simply on reading the cues of others, but rather on a dynamic \"dance\" whereby partners engage in nonconscious mimicry, and in so doing, are able to use perceptions of their own bodily states to infer their partner's feelings and, thereby, predict their motivations. To investigate this possibility, the research team will conduct experiments examining the interplay of emitted nonverbal signals and mimicry on decisions to trust within the context of behavioral economic games. Moreover, given that many facets of these phenomena often occur outside of human awareness and control, newly developed social robots will be used as interaction partners for humans in several experiments. These robots provide not only exacting control over relevant expressive parameters that is not possible in humans, but also the opportunity to test proposed models by allowing the robot to predict the trustworthiness of human partners. Taken as a whole, this project not only holds potential to increase understanding of the processes the underlie the initial emergence of trust-based relationships, but also to refine the physical and computational architecture that enable robots to infer motives and predict actions of humans and, thereby, increase their utility and value as interaction partners."

These materials have a number of desirable characteristics. The electronic and optical properties of nanocrystals are size-tunable, which will allow optimal coverage of the solar spectrum by structures with large cross-sections. Their compatibility with solution environments and low-temperature processing are attractive for practical and cost-effective production. Beyond their potential to transform low-cost solar energy conversion technology, nanocrystal-based solar cells also have the potential for substantially increased efficiency, based on the recently-discovered process of efficient multi-exciton generation. In this process a single incident photon can generate multiple electron-hole pairs and thereby utilize the absorbed photon energy in excess of the band gap, which would otherwise be lost as heat.    Progress in the development of nanocrystal-based solar cells is currently limited by the lack of molecular-level control over the electronic properties at the interface. Initial efforts in this field have focused on hybrid organic-inorganic devices based on blends of nanocrystals and conjugated polymers. This approach suffered from poor extraction of photogenerated carriers and illustrated that improved understanding and control over the interface properties are required to fully harness the unique photon harvesting properties of these materials. The project led by Engstrom and Hanrath leverages their expertise in surface science, nanocrystal synthesis and device fabrication to study fundamental principles of interface charge transfer and to integrate tailored nanocrystal interfaces into novel all-inorganic distributed heterojunction solar cells. The goals of their work are: (1) to understand and control the electronic structure and transport properties at nanocrystal interfaces and (2) to apply that knowledge to engineer optimized interfaces for the use of semiconductor nanocrystals in distributed heterojunction solar cells.    Beyond the scientific activities, the project will engage a number of faculty and students involved in solar energy research in a workshop on research ethics. Solar energy, being on the frontier of research, is susceptible to practices that might lead to a number of undesirable outcomes. Educating the community about the proper conduct of research, ranging from the writing of and review of proposals to day-to-day activities in the lab will better foster a productive research environment. Finally, the project is closely integrated with a number of outreach and educational activities. We have aligned with the Cornell Institute for Physics Teachers to reach out to high school teachers and students and engage them in the exciting advances being made in the field."

Intellectual Merit: Cornell University researchers will develop technologies aimed at supporting a new kind of trustworthy distributed computing service on the Internet.  The project will have a foundational intellectual impact by showing that what have previously been treated as a dozen separate, often ill-defined functions can be unified into a single conceptually elegant abstraction (distributed role delegation), and by developing the needed science and mathematics to reason about this mechanism.

Coherently micro- and nanopatterned surfaces provide exciting opportunities for scientific and technological breakthoughs owing to both the rich interplay of multiple physical processes and increased experimental flexibility achieved through electric field-mediated control of cellular and molecular transport.    While dielectrophoretic forces have been used to trap and manipulate particles and, in selected cases, to manipulate macromolecules, their implementation in rapid, continuous-flow techniques has been minimal, and its exquisite sensitivity to dielectric properties has not been implemented to create inexpensive and specific separation screens for cell membrane lipid mutation and molecular agglomeration.  The proposed work combines a novel micro/nanodevice design with detailed dielectric, ion transport, and fluid transport modeling.  Electrokinetic actuation of cells and molecules will be combined with geometric manipulation of electric fields to allow for continuous-flow separation dependent primarily on induced or existing electrical dipoles.  A critical and novel component of the design focuses on the use of coherently patterned perturbations in a microchannel surface to create a secondary dielectrophoretic force field that superposes with the linear electromigratory force field.  By using DC-offset AC fields, the relative magnitudes of linear and nonlinear electromigratory phenomena can be tuned to optimize the separation.  The proposed work bridges the gap between existing batch-processing DEP sorting techniques and the needed continuous-flow separation screens.    The long-term goal of this work is to develop a design methodology by which devices can be fabricated for continuous-flow separations of cells and molecules.  The overall objective of the proposed research is to use geometric manipulation of electrical dipoles to develop rapid, continuous-flow separations for cells and proteins.  The proposal will focus on two distinct but related hypotheses: 1) coherently-patterned microdevices will allow for continuous-flow separation of mutated cells owing to coulomb interaction between a spatially-varying electric field and induced particle electrical dipoles; and 2) coherently-patterned nanodevices will allow for continuous-flow separation of proteins (particularly those in fibrillated states) due to coulomb interaction between spatially-varying electric fields and native protein electrical dipoles.    By implementing design via a model-based engineering formalism for describing particle transport in ridged micro- and nanochannels, the proposed work will enable surface patterning design that generates unique nanoparticle and macromolecule sorting capabilities.  Asynchronous instructional materials related to the ethics of nanotechnology and the modeling of nanoscale transport will be developed to integrate ethics, coursework, and research."

Physics, at the same time, has been significantly enriched by approaches from discrete computation, such as message-passing algorithms.     The investigators study two complementary approaches for addressing algorithmic challenges: 1) treating problem instances as members of a random ensemble that can be analyzed as a physical model, and 2) identifying specific classes of instances amenable to physical analysis. The first suggests a fundamental connection between algorithmic performance and an underlying physical phase structure, and has already led to significant new algorithms for unstructured random graphs or networks. The challenge is to generalize it to structured cases. The second uses techniques such as renormalization group and multiscale decomposition, and is proving to be a powerful new approach in probabilistic inference."

Classification arises  frequently in web search problems and also in forensics, where  the goal is to determine the authorship of an anonymous document.

Computing a minimum-cost spanning tree is one of the first graph algorithms to be taught in any standard algorithms course; indeed, the minimum-cost spanning tree algorithm of Boruvka is one of the earliest graph algorithms known.  In the last decade or so, similar advances in our understanding of approximation algorithms have occurred through research into generalizations of the minimum-cost spanning tree problem and the Steiner tree problem. This research will consider more recent issues in the low-cost design of networks, and to discover similar, general algorithmic techniques to address them.    One central issue now under consideration is that of the role of uncertainty in the specification of the design of the network.  One of the ways this is done is by considering a probability distribution over the potential connectivity requirements, leading to stochastic optimization problems; another is that of giving a universal solution, from which a good solution can be derived no matter what requirements are realized.  Most prior work in the area assumed that network connections would be purchased, but recent work in infrastructure leasing considers issues in which connectivity requirements are satisfied for shorter periods of time by leasing connectivity from another party instead of building a network.    Finally, recent work has considered the general problem of dropping connectivity requirements in the case that they become too expensive to fulfill.  This has been explored in simple cases in the past of the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem, but more general models have only recently started to be considered.  The intellectual merit of the research lies in finding significant methodological innovations in the course of addressing these issues, and finding simpler, better, more general, and more practical approximation algorithms as a result of this research.    Network design problems are increasingly important in a society where reliable communication is essential. In many situations, there is uncertainty about the inputs on which you must compute, since, for example, it is hard to detect failed links and exact network speeds are volatile.  If successful, this research will lead to algorithms that can deal with the uncertainty inherent in real-world networks."

Unfortunately, the relative importance of factors acting before and after settlement that limit recruitment and gene flow is still unknown for most species and most marine ecosystems. This is partly because the interactions between larval behavior and hydrography are difficult to study, so dispersal constraints are only inferred indirectly. In addition, many marine species are not amenable to strong spatial tests of post-settlement selection and these experiments are difficult to accomplish at the large spatial scales relevant to high dispersal species. Consequently, only a handful of natural systems have yielded results that distinguish pre- and post-settlement constraints on gene flow such that our understanding of mechanisms generating genetic and phenotypic population structure is piece meal.     The intellectual merit of the study is that it achieves this dual goal in an estuarine species inhabiting semi-connected lagoons along eastern Florida where there is a latitudinal gradient in environmental variables, community composition, and potential larval dispersal vectors. Much of the western North Atlantic coastline includes shallow lagoons enclosed by barrier islands, but only a handful of studies have measured connectivity among estuaries, and none among lagoons. This project builds on significant previous research on the eastern oyster, Crassostrea Virginica to integrate pre- and post-settlement measurements. High resolution genetic identification of migrants will be used to construct a connectivity matrix among 30 populations in each of three years. Statistical associations will be tested between dispersal patterns and hypothesized dispersal vectors and constraints. Cohort analysis will be used to test for spatial variation in genotype-specific survivorship along the entire coast. Also, in each of two years, relative postsettlement survivorship and performance will be measured in field common gardens in which local individuals, migrants and hybrids are compared. Finally, fertilization efficiency of within- and between-population crosses will be compared to test the hypothesis that gamete incompatibilities limit gene flow. The results will be integrated in models that describe the spatially and/or temporally dynamic balance between dispersal and selection, define the spatial scale of local adaptation along the ecotone, and identify abiotic gene flow constraints that may affect codistributed species.    The broader impacts of this study derive from its focus on important habitats for diversity and fisheries management, and on the involvement of underrepresented groups. The oyster populations under study inhabit eastern Florida lagoons that possess the highest diversity of any estuary in the United States, yet this coastline is undergoing rapid development. In addition, the Cape Canaveral lagoons contain the oldest marine protected area in North America. Understanding the impact of this reserve on surrounding fished populations hinges on dispersal across its boundaries and on habitat quality, both of which are studied here. This study will also support one PhD student who will focus on the measurements of selection for her dissertation. The graduate student is a female African-American who endeavors to study marine evolutionary ecology, a goal spanning two fields with extremely low minority representation. The P.I. has a continuing interest in attracting the next generation of scholars. Currently four undergraduates work in the Hare lab on projects related to the Florida ecotone. Three of the undergraduates are women and the fourth an African-American. Funding from NSF will allow undergraduate participation to be expanded to include summer field work in Florida. Previous undergraduates working in the Hare lab have obtained Howard Hughes fellowships and contributed to publications (Gaines et al. 2005). The University of Maryland graduates more African-Americans than any of the top 20 universities in this country. This provides a large pool of minority candidates for possible recruitment to the Hare lab. The P.I. has a history of integrating primary research results into lectures in introductory genetics. Research results are also disseminated via lab web page postings."

If such a node can be mass produced in a CMOS process without a costly external crystal such that the network formed by a set of homogenous nodes is robust to network changes or any node failing, then reliable ad-hoc networks may be formed from sets of these nodes with group intelligence akin to a distributed machine. This project focuses on the development and exploitation of a distributed computing machine formed out of a network of integrated single chip microsystems that combine both communication and computation functions with a total power budget that is under 50�W. Low power performance, critical to long lifetimes is achieved through duty cycling of the transceiver and establishment of a global clock via natural phenomenon of pulse coupled oscillators (PCOs) as well as the use of simple event driven computation. Although each node has limited computing capability, the power of such a network will arise from aggregate capabilities to perform distributed computing tasks. This project explores three issues; the construction of the network from simple nodes, communication within the network, and the computing potential for such a constrained platform.

Holm    The principal investigator's principal focus in this proposal is group  actions and reduction in symplectic geometry.  A fundamental problem  in symplectic geometry is to relate the geometry and topology of a  Hamiltonian system to the combinatorics of the moment polytope, and  vice versa.  The principal players on the geometric side include the  symplectic manifold itself and its symplectic reductions.  Combinatorially, the vertices, edges, k-dimensional faces, and even  the chambers of the moment polytope play a significant role.  Generically, a symplectic reduction has orbifold singularities.  The  principal investigator outlines a program towards understanding the  geometry and topology of such orbifolds.  These results will provide  insight into the structure of the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring,  yielding information about orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants.  This  work has also naturally led to foundational questions regarding group  actions on orbifolds.  Finally, the PI will distill the geometry and  topology of the Hamiltonian system into combinatorial data associated  to the moment polytope.  This will shed new light on recent  combinatorial results concerning intervals in the Bruhat order on any  Coxeter group.    Symplectic geometry is the mathematical framework for describing  phenomena in mathematical physics, from classical mechanics to string  theory.  The moment map is an important tool that translates the  symmetries of a physical system into discrete data.  An expert in  symplectic geometry, the PI will achieve a deeper understanding of the  relationship between the geometry of a symplectic manifold and the  combinatorics of the moment map data.  Her work will shed light on  stringy invariants in this context.  The proposed activities will  advance our knowledge in the fields of symplectic geometry and  combinatorics, with applications to algebraic geometry, algebraic  topology and mathematical physics.  The PI's broader objectives  include increasing the participation and visibility of women in  research mathematics, and enhancing the undergraduate experience in  mathematics."

Traditional approaches try to capture the Internet?s detailed behavior at a granular level, but then struggle with the system?s overwhelming complexity. At the other extreme, models that emphasize the large scale while ignoring fine details are more tractable, but frequently neglect features needed for practical engineering issues, especially when dynamical rather than static behaviors are an important concern. This research develops a happy medium through a novel fusion of analytical and computational techniques.  Three important problems are explored.  The first concerns the overall efficiency and stability of the Internet; the second develops methods for improving the functioning of sensor networks (large arrays of small sensors that can be used to monitor environmental changes); and the third focuses on improving the quality of large cooperative computing systems by providing incentives for users to behave in ways that benefit the whole.    The potentially transformative aspect of this research lies in its ?computational-analytic? approach to creating effective models for a wide range of complex networks. In this strategy, computational techniques are interlaced with analytical ones, using such methods as ?equation-free modeling?? from chemical engineering and numerical renormalization from statistical physics. The approach is radically interdisciplinary, with the power to unify and extend multi-scale analytical methods adapted from such diverse fields as dynamical systems theory, mathematical physics and theoretical biology.  Spin-offs of the techniques created here are expected and will be investigated for other important problems involving complex networks, including routing on the Internet, synchronization in neural networks, and stability in global financial networks."

In some situations, such as transcriptomic data measuring gene activities, the index is time while in other situations, such as in genetics association study, the index is position in a genomic DNA sequence and, in any case, the complete collection of data is referred to as a time series.  Inference is the process of taking such time series, probably corrupted by errors, and computing answers to the following sorts of questions: (1) What is the system that generated the time series?  For instance, if the system is known to be a differential equation of a specific type, what are the parameter values in the differential equation? (2) Given a completely specified system and a time series, did that system generate that time series?  For instance, if a biologist has hypothesized a system that describes gene expression for a particular set of genes and then measures expression data, is the data compatible with the system, or equivalently, the hypothesis?  (3) Given two time series, were they generated by the same system?  For instance, if the pattern of nerve firings in a neural system is recorded in two different experimental situations, is the pattern the same or is it different?  The four Principal Investigators are focused on three different biological application domains at three different biological scales: (1) the phenotyping of animal and human ethanol-consumption behavior (whole organism scale), (2) the pattern of action potentials measured on ensembles of neurons (cell-population scale), and (3) the time course of gene expressions as governed by the regulatory circuits of the cell (cellular scale).  The types of challenges that are encountered in these applications include the following characteristics: the information is distributed over long periods of time rather than concentrated in time; the systems include delays and feedback paths; and the systems are highly nonlinear, including switching behavior, rather than linear.  The major methodologies that will be developed and combined to solve inference problems in these application areas are: (a) information theory and stochastic control, (b) multi-scale approaches to learning the geometry of the data, and (c) computer algebra and symbolic computation.  For example, to deal with the presence of delay and feedback in neuroscience systems, especially in the context of the interaction between information and stochastic control, requires a fundamental rethinking of classical information theory as it is employed in technology-based communication systems.    As the cost of computing decreases, computing becomes increasingly pervasive.  A major purpose of pervasive computing is the real-time collection of high-dimensional time series of very diverse types of data including biological, medical, financial, communication systems status, power systems status, etc.  The project will provide computational algorithms and software to analyze this data in more sophisticated ways and thereby extract more sophisticated information.  Action taken upon this more sophisticated information, e.g., personalized medicine based on individualized genomic information or more accurate and flexible control of power systems thereby avoiding blackouts, will have important human and economic benefits to society.  An important component of the project is educational, e.g., three graduate students working on the project will receive tuition and stipend and an unrestricted number of undergraduates will participate through a variety of ways, e.g., project courses.  By attracting talented students to science and technology and providing challenging research experiences, the project will have important work force benefits to society."

The intellectual merit of this effort lies in the unique and potentially transformative opportunity it has to integrate a wide range of tools, services, content, and context from many different institutions and projects into a common framework of knowledge organization and discovery, enabling other projects to accomplish far more than they could have on their own. By integrating resources, description, context and contribution from many varied organizations, projects, and individuals, and by offering tools to explore and understand this knowledge space, the TNS project is serving as an important component of support for cyber-enabled STEM education in a networked world. The broader impacts of this project are felt along several directions. First, it is helping both NSF grantees and many other related educational projects to better serve their specific audiences by focusing less on recreating technical developments and focusing more on serving as sites for teaching, mentoring, and supporting research of large numbers of STEM students and teachers. Second, it is establishing a broad-based community engagement process to foster creativity, innovation, and contributions to the design and use of next-generation educational cyberinfrastructure and interactive learning applications. Third, it is instrumenting the NSDL infrastructure to collect detailed (anonymized) usage and behavioral data, providing the basis for next-generation research into: personalized learning, educationally-informed recommendation engines, formation and evolution of educational social networks, and other areas where large volumes of user-generated actions and activities are needed."

Shaw  Co-P.I.:  Patrick D. Danley    The behavioral traits that contribute to reproductive behavior often change rapidly and may spur the creation of new species.  Understanding how changes in reproductive behavior, and the potential differentiation of species, is critically dependent on knowing which genes contribute to behavioral variation and how these genes act to produce these behaviors in the developing organism.  The genetic basis of cricket song, a model behavior involved in the reproductive behavior of crickets, will be studied in the Hawaiian genus Laupala.  Species of Laupala are ideal for studying the connection between genes and behavior because (1) neurobiologists have long studied cricket song, (2) the function of cricket song has been intensively studied, (3) closely related species possess different male songs, which suggests that cricket song has played a role in the creation of new species, and (4) the way in which cricket songs have changed are valuable for testing evolutionary hypotheses.  In the proposed research, the genetic basis of naturally occurring variation in pulse rate of the male calling song will be studied in closely related species.  Genetic tools will be developed to identify genes influencing male song and to correlate the activity of these genes with differences in male calling song across multiple species.  The hypothesis that will be tested is that genes underlying the development of singing behavior in crickets are the same genes that underlie natural behavioral variation."

Despite recent progress in understanding the underlying unsteady aerodynamics, which are notably different from conventional aerodynamics, relatively little is known about how insects execute flight maneuvers and far less is known about the main mechanisms that determine the diverse behaviors seen in natural flight. We propose an integrated approach to the study of insect flight that incorporates high resolution kinematics of freely flying insects, aerodynamic analysis of wing and body motions, and dynamical systems analysis of these data that will lead to reduced order models. Specifically, we propose three high risk pilot studies: 1) develop automated tracking techniques for 3D flight data that will be essential for aerodynamic and statistical analysis of cross-species comparison of free flight behaviors, 2) provide for the first time a direct connection between the internal muscles to the external observables in free flight through aerodynamics analysis and direct measurements, and 3) perform novel mathematical analysis of stability of free flight and build tools for constructing data-driven reduced order models.    We expect that this unprecedented integration of large experimental data sets and numerical analyses will transform research on insect flight. Our work will provide new tools to investigate fundamental issues relating to efficiency, stability, and control in animal locomotion. The techniques, algorithms and routines we develop will be distributed and made available to the research community through our web sites.

In particular, \"virtual organizations\" - aggregations of individuals, facilities and resources that span geographic and institutional boundaries - are an increasingly common work structure in a range of settings. One of the most important problems faced by those working in virtual organizations, however, is that unscheduled informal interaction with colleagues can be difficult to support. When compared with face-to-face collaborations, this means unanticipated problems can take longer to solve, uncertainties and misunderstandings can persist longer, and relationships may take longer to develop.    Supporting informal interactions requires improved interpersonal awareness, that is, the ability to quickly and naturally see what colleagues are doing and whether or not they are available to talk. To date, design and research efforts have generally failed to produce novel and widely adopted technologies that overcome the problems associated with sub-optimal interpersonal awareness in virtual organizations. One problem limiting progress in the area is the implicit assumption in many awareness and interruption minimization technologies to reduce ambiguity and provide accurate information about others. There is increasing evidence, however, to suggest that such assumptions may not be valid. In communication, people frequently draw on the ambiguous properties of certain media to maintain plausible deniability about message receipt, avoid confrontation, as well as to encourage or discourage rapid response to a query.     With regard to awareness technologies, such practices can sometimes be considered deceptive in that false information about one's availability may be deliberately provided to colleagues. This leads to the following research questions: When and how do people use deception to manage interpersonal awareness with current ICTs? What is the impact of these deceptions on their self-concept and their ability to work with colleagues?    Most existing work in this area aims to either characterize people's use of deception, or eliminate deception by providing more accurate information. The long-term goal of this project, on the other hand, is to identify deception and to exploit it as a resource in designing and implementing improved awareness technologies. This SGER enables preliminary work on novel ideas about the identification and usage of deception hotspots in interpersonal awareness is the first exploratory step of a research program that could significantly impact how interpersonal awareness technologies are considered and designed, as well as our understanding of the role of deception in interpersonal awareness. Its primary contributions are: 1) a systematic examination of the conditions under which deception is used as a resource with existing awareness technologies, and 2) a conceptualization of deceptions as an indicator of a \"trouble spot\" in how a technology is supporting interpersonal awareness.     Broader Impact: The results of this project will be critical to providing the necessary social capacities in our national cyberinfrastructure that will enable effective and transformative work in various forms of geographically distributed virtual organizations."

This project starts with the recognition that we must substantially rethink our relationship to the environment. The project develops an understanding of the marginal ties of this particular community to an industrialized consumer culture to highlight the aspects of everyday IT design which are predicated on industrialized orientations such as mass production and consumption of consumer goods and a disconnect with the natural environment. In response to this understanding, a design case book is developed to reflect a sustainable approach to human-computer interaction (HCI). Design directions that arise from taking Change Islanders? lifestyle and perspectives seriously contribute to the fundamental rethinking of IT practice which will be an essential requirement of sustainable HCI."

The Nanobiotechnology Center (NBTC) features a highly interdisciplinary, close collaboration between life scientists, physical scientists, and engineers from Cornell University, Princeton University, Oregon Health Sciences University, and Wadsworth Center of the New York State Health Department.  The integrating vision of the NBTC is that nanobiotechnology will be the genesis of new insights into the function of biological systems, and lead to the design of new classes of nano- and microfabricated devices and systems.  Biological systems present a particular challenge in that the diversity of materials and chemical systems for biological applications far exceeds those for silicon-based technology in the integrated-circuit industry.  New fabrication processes appropriate for biological materials will require a substantial expansion in knowledge about the interface between organic and inorganic systems.  The ability to structure materials and pattern surface chemistry at small dimensions ranging from the molecular to cellular scale are the fundamental technologies on which the research of the NBTC is based.  Nanofabrication can also be used to form new analytical probes for interrogating biological systems with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity.  Three unifying technology platforms that foster advances in materials, processes, and tools underlie and support the research programs of the NBTC: Molecules of nanobiotechnology; Novel methods of patterning surfaces for attachment of molecules and cells to substrates; and Sensors and devices for nanobiotechnology.  Newly developed fabrication capabilities will also be available through the extensive resources of the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility, a site of the NSF National Nanofabrication Users Network.  The NBTC will be an integrated part of the educational missions of the participating institutions.  NBTC faculty will develop a new cornerstone graduate course in nanobiotechnology featuring nanofabrication with an emphasis on biological applications.  Graduate students who enter the NBTC from a background in engineering or biology will cross-train in the other field by engaging in a significant level of complementary course work.  Participation in the NBTC will prepare them with the disciplinary depth and cross-disciplinary understanding to become next generation leaders in this emerging field.  An undergraduate research experience program with a strong mentoring structure will be established, with emphasis on recruiting women and underrepresented minorities into the program.  Educational outreach activities are planned to stimulate the interest of students of all ages.  One such activity partnered with the Science center in Ithaca is a traveling exhibition for museum showings on the subject of nano scale size.  National and federal laboratories and industrial and other partners will participate in various aspects of the NBTC such as by hosting interns, attendance at symposia and scientist exchanges.  Partnering with the industrial affiliates will be emphasized to enhance knowledge transfer and student and postdoctoral training.
