The study's long-term span, innovative genealogical design, and comprehensive content have been critical to the fundamental understanding of a wide variety of key social science issues, including those involving life course effects. With thirty-plus years of data on the same families, the PSID can justly be considered a cornerstone of the infrastructure support for empirically based social science research.  Through its long-term measures of economic and social well being, and based on its representative sample of U.S. families, the study has compelled both researchers and policy makers to confront and learn from the dynamism inherent in economic processes.    The enormous usefulness of decades of data on the same families has made the PSID one of the most widely used social science data sets in the world. The project currently delivers 6,500 customized data sets a year to researchers via its Internet Data Center. Since 1968, over 2,000 journal articles, books and chapters, dissertations and other works have been based on PSID data. And the study has been named one of the National Science Foundation's `Nifty Fifty' most notable research efforts.    The 1997-2001 funding cycle represented a major transition period for the PSID, in which the project implemented several important changes. In response to concern about dramatic growth in sample size, maintenance of representativeness, and fiscal constraints at the federal level, the project added a refresher sample of post-1968 immigrants and suspended a number of families from the original Census Bureau oversample of low-income families. Most importantly, the study moved to a bi-ennial data collection schedule, with consequent changes to the instrument in order to collect interwave information on key variables. All of these changes returned the study to a ""steady state"" that maintains a sample of about the same size, attains national representation inclusive of new entrants, and has proved less costly to run-while maintaining the study's traditionally high data quality.  In addition, to facilitate greater use of the data set, content was expanded in six major areas (intergenerational studies; savings and consumption; technology and capital formation; health and aging; child development; and immigration).    In the 2002-2006 funding cycle, the PSID stabilizes and maintains this new state of the study. In contrast to the pre-1997 state, the study's interview periodicity is now longer and its content is greatly expanded. The project focuses on improving the measures in areas affected by the longer periodicity, assessing the research value of the newly added content domains, and improving the processing and delivery of the data that is collected. Specifically, the project:    1.		Expands content to facilitate investigation of current research questions and policy issues;  2.	Continues the 1997-2001 cycle's data collection design changes, including biennial interviewing, with the associated cost reductions and productivity increases;  3.	Integrates event history calendar methodology into the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) application to ensure data quality despite the greater time between interviews;  4.		Maintains and improves several new systems for data editing, processing, and documentation;  5.	Ensures that the study is the ""Gold Standard"" for income information through redesign of the CATI data collection instrument based on an Income and Wages Project; and  6.		Improves and expedite data delivery through enhancements of the PSID web site Data Center.    The renewal permits the PSID to perfect and assess the research value of the wider content areas and further facilitate usage of the study's data through improved data collection and processing. These efforts strongly reinforce the infrastructure value of the study in terms of the range of topics that can be addressed with the data and the ease of use for an ever-broadening range of social science scholars.",Frank Stafford|Jacquelynne Eccles|Robert Belli|Robert Schoeni|Wei-Jun Jean Yeung

The best current example of this knowledge gap is on-chip inductance. A large part of this project focuses on developing models, metrics, and design approaches to assess and ameliorate the impact of inductance on circuit performance. This includes a range of RLC-based models varying in accuracy and complexity that target different stages of the design flow ranging from standard cell characterization to late-mode full-chip timing. Other impending knowledge gaps being studied in this research program include: 1) standard cell interconnect libraries to leverage predictability and maintain performance, and 2) scalable global signaling alternatives to CMOS repeaters for nanometer design (feature sizes < 100 nm).  The education component of this CAREER program has two broad aims: 1) introduce students to the role of on-chip interconnect on circuit performance early and often, and 2) transfer a diverse population of students to industry with relevant design experience via group design projects.",Dennis Sylvester|

The emphasis will be on how collections of diverse agents behave and adapt when their interactions are structured by formal and informal institutional constraints. Student researchers will study how formal institutions adapt and respond, how informal institutions emerge, how the structure of relationships between and within institutions affects performance and robustness, and when and how cultural, social, economic and behavioral diversity matter for institutions. The program will be housed at the University of Michigan but students will have the opportunity to visit the Santa Fe Institute for a semester. The IDEAS IGERT will enable students to become active members in the social science research communities at both institutions through seminars, research assistantships, interdisciplinary courses, and interactions with faculty. IDEAS students will also take courses and attend seminars with students enrolled in STIET (another NSF sponsored IGERT at UM).    IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.

Fisher,"August 31,  2009",421853,,mingyan@eecs.umich.edu,3003 South State St.,Ann Arbor,MI,48109,7347641817L,CSE,4097,HPCC|9218|4097|1187|1045,0206000    Telecommunications                      |,238035,"The proposed research centers on a design methodology for large-scale wireless sensor networks used for data gathering that uses fundamental capacity limit studies as guidelines.  The motivation is that a large sensor network can potentially consist of thousands or tens of thousands of sensors densely populated, with strict energy and complexity constraints. Therefore the design of any protocol or algorithm should come with precision and a quantifiable measure, and be based on a good understanding of the ultimate scalability limit.  This proposal aims at bridging the gap between the fundamental limit studies and practical protocol design.  The goal of the proposed research is to (1) derive capacity limits critical to the large class of data gathering sensor network applications; (2) develop practical distributed algorithms that use these limits as guidelines and can approach these limits; and (3) examine the actual achievable performance of these algorithms in a real sensor testbed setting.  Consequently, there are three parts to the proposed research: fundamental capacity limits, distributed algorithms, and testbed experiments.  A central theme of the proposed research is to bridge the gap between the theoretical achievability of fundamental limits and the optimality of practical network designs.  The proposed design methodology is thus driven by capacity limit studies via novel modeling techniques.  It provides a novel and powerful tool in the study of network scalability and feasibility.     Under fundamental capacity limits, will study two capacity notions: the throughput capacity, defined within the context of many-to-one communication as the maximum achievable throughput when all nodes are communicating with a single receiver via either a single hop or multiple hops; and the lifetime capacity, defined as the maximum amount of data deliverable by a sensor network until the first sensor dies (due to energy depletion) or till a pre-specified percentage of sensors die. The study of these two capacity notions has direct implications on organizing communications within a network, e.g., whether clustering should be used and how big a cluster should be, how many data collecting base stations should there be and where should they be placed. This study will progress from simple idealized scenarios to increasingly more realistic and complex.     Under distributed algorithms, will apply the capacity analysis to the design of distributed algorithms of energy efficient data dissemination, optimal clustering and efficient sensor sleep schedules.  These algorithms will be designed to approach or approximate network capacities.  Under the proposed research will also develop an experimental wireless sensor testbed for implementation and measurement purposes.      The proposed research has a strong education aspect and involves collaboration with two research centers at the University of Michigan. Will seek close collaboration with the Wireless Integrated Micro-systems (WIMS) Center, an NSF ERC at the University of Michigan, and University of Michigan's Wu Manufacturing Research Center (WuMRC). Will incorporate state-of-the-art MEMS sensors currently being developed at WIMS and intelligent infotronics agent sensors being developed for automation systems by WuMRC into our sensor testbed.  Collaboration with them will allow the PI to apply  design methodology to different application contexts with realistic physical devices.",Mingyan Liu|

Genomics has greatly advanced our knowledge concerning how biological systems are programmed. This ""software"", however, is embedded in the ""hardware"" of a cell, which interacts with its environment to compute its specific outputs such as growth, differentiation, or death. The micro- and nanotechnology developed in this project will enable control over configuration of the cellular hardware such as receptor clustering and cell shape. The technology will then be used to study how different hardware configurations affect subcellular signaling and cell function. Specifically, multiple laminar flow technology will be used to stimulate subcellular microdomains with growth factors and soft lithographic three-dimensional protein nanopatterning technology will be developed to perform nanoscale extracellular matrix engineering. The two technologies will provide, with subcellular resolution, control of cross-talk between growth factor signals and adhesive signals. This type of knowledge is specifically relevant to understanding physiological processes such as embryonic development and wound healing as well as pathological states such as fibrosis and cancer. The research will be tightly coupled with the education and training of a work force that can translate these scientific and engineering discoveries into tangible social and economic improvements.

Of great recent interest are the behaviors of a system poised between two stable zero temperature ground states, i.e. at a quantum critical point.  This individual investigator project uses the techniques of photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopies to measure the single-particle electronic structures of selected strongly correlated electron materials displaying novel quantum behaviors, and seeks to construct the paths whereby these behaviors emerge from the underlying electronic structure or transform from one order to another.  During the course of the next project period, the program will focus on two main themes, (A) quantum criticality in relation to (1) Non-Fermi Liquid (NFL) behavior generally and (2) electron fractionalization in low dimensional materials, and (B) certain novel or paradigmatic phase transitions.  If successful the work will demonstrate the need for an overarching theoretical picture linking quantum criticality, fractionalization and NFL behavior that transcends dimensionality and material type.  The experiments are performed both in a home laboratory, and at various national and international synchrotron facilities.  The experimental data are analyzed by comparison to theories which treat the Coulomb interactions in different ways, and which provide a link between the spectra and the electrical or magnetic properties.  The program relies on strong collaborations with other groups for well-characterized samples to measure, for determining electrical, thermal and magnetic properties of new materials, and for expert theoretical advice and advanced calculations.  Thus, it builds human bridges across geographic, institutional and disciplinary boundaries.  It also brings Ph.D. students into close contact with scientists in a variety of professional roles at a variety of institutions around the world, and trains them in the techniques of collaborative work.    The electrical, magnetic and mechanical properties of materials are ""emergent collective behaviors"" of the underlying quantum mechanics of their electrons and constituent atoms.  A principal goal of solid state physics and materials science is to elucidate this emergence.  Achieving this goal would imply the ability to engineer a material that is optimum for any particular application.  The mainstay of the current understanding of electrons in solids is known as the ""Fermi liquid theory.""  This theory explains why electrons in solids can often be described in a simplified picture that appears to ignore the large repulsive forces electrons are known to exert on one another.  There is a growing appreciation that this theory probably fails for entire classes of materials and there is the suspicion that the failure has to do with unresolved competition between different possible emergent behaviors.  This individual investigator grant supports an experimental program aimed at using a technique called electron spectroscopy to measure and quantify the underlying quantum mechanical behaviors of electrons in materials that manifest this unresolved competition in various ways.  If successful the work will pinpoint essential ideas that must be combined to take the goal of engineering materials to the next level of sophistication.

As Beck and Katz (1996) noted, their empirical analyses typically reflect one of two perspectives on these temporal and spatial dependencies. Some see such correlations as a nuisance. These analysts' concerns surround the drawing of accurate causal inferences about relations between other explanatory variables and the dependent variables; interest in temporal and spatial dependence arises only insofar as such dependence might jeopardize these theoretically more-central inferences. Given these goals, they do not always see a need to model spatial (or temporal) dependence directly. They argue, sometimes incorrectly, that the only cost of failing to do so lies in reduced efficiency, and that, therefore, estimation of standard errors robust to spatial (and temporal) correlation may suffice to ensure sound inferences. Others have more-substantive interest in spatial (and temporal) dependence and attempt to model these relationships directly. Standard practice in political science is now to model dynamics (i.e., temporal dependence) directly, typically with lags of the dependent variable, and to address spatial dependence solely by applying panel-corrected (robust) standard-errors. Thus, researchers commonly treat spatial dependence as a nuisance.  In this project, the researchersargue, however, that direct modeling of spatial dependence (plus robust standard-errors perhaps) is always superior, regardless of the substantive interest in these relationships. Directly modeling spatial dependence enhances efficiency and, under many circumstances, is necessary to obtain unbiased coefficient estimates for non-spatial regressors. If, e.g., both dependent and independent variables correlate spatially, yet the statistical model ignores these correlations or relegates their role to adjusting standard-error estimates, the resulting inefficient coefficient estimates will also tend to misstate (i.e., bias) the direct effects of explanatory variables (adding to them the effects of spatial diffusion or of omitted stimuli that correlate across space). This also implies biased hypothesis tests, with null hypotheses rejected more or less often than truly warranted.   Understandably, analysts uninterested in spatial relationships per se will want to employ simple proxies for more-complicated diffusion processes or omitted spatially correlated stimuli.  The researchers investigate spatial lags and indicators as two such simple proxies. Those more directly interested in spatial dependence, contrarily, will prefer more sophisticated modeling techniques to estimate the possibly complex diffusion patterns in their data.  For these purposes, the investigators explore spatial analogues to estimators from econometric approaches to dynamic-panel models (e.g., Hsiao 1986; Baltagi 1995).  This sophisticated methodological investigation is addressed both to social-science   researchers directly interested in spatial relationships (spatial substance) and to those primarily concerned to make optimal inferences regarding other substantive relationships given spatially dependent data (spatial nuisance). Building from analogies to similar, better-explored issues arising in temporal dependence and through analytic derivation and Monte Carlo experimentation, the investigators: (1) detail the conditions under which failing to model spatial dependence directly (or relegating its role to standard-error adjustment) renders other coefficient estimates biased or merely inefficient, exploring bias and inefficiency magnitudes under varying spatial-dependence conditions; (2) distinguish spatial diffusion from correlated responses to omitted spatially correlated factors conceptually and explore the properties of alternative approaches to making this distinction empirically; (3) develop and evaluate several non-, semi-, and parametric tests for and gauges of spatial correlation, with and without spatial lags in the model; (4) compare the properties of simple proxies for full models of the true spatial-diffusion or common omitted-factors--e.g., spatial dummies or symmetric spatial-lags comprised of averages of other cross-section units. dependent variables each time-period--to each other, to PCSE's alone, and to differing methods of estimating fuller models.  The researchers will create and publish freely statistical-software algorithms to implement, and, where potentially useful, pedagogical modules, to teach, all of the techniques that they develop and explore",Robert Franzese|Jude Hays

The investigators will address  common issues of importance with their data using state-of-the-art analysis techniques. The Center will focus on four specific questions: 1) Is middle childhood a particularly sensitive time during which attitudes, beliefs, and views of the self crystallize and thus determine later life success (e.g., occupational, educational, relationship success) or difficulty (e.g., aggressive behavior, depression)? 2) Which childhood influences (e.g., family, school, peer) matter the most for positive and negative adolescent and adult outcomes, and at what points in time do they have the most influence? 3) Do personal characteristics of the child (e.g., temperament, intelligence, gender of the child) influence the impact of family, school, and peer influences in predicting later life outcomes? 4) How similar are parents and their children in positive behaviors (e.g., social skills, intellectual achievement) and negative behaviors (e.g., aggression), and how do family, peer, and school influences affect these cross-generational similarities and differences?     Although the influences studied in any one project are limited, taken together the many projects participating in this Center can examine a wide range of influences during childhood. In addition, because of the breadth of these longitudinal projects, the Center's efforts will foster new methodological and statistical approaches. The Center will promote innovative, multi-disciplinary training of undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students through courses, workshops, and collaborative research experiences. The findings are expected to lead to the creation of effective interventions for improving life outcomes by identifying specific factors that have powerful short- and long-term influences on development. Analyses will address the effects of family, peer, school, neighborhood, and media influences on socially and clinically important outcomes such as school success/failure, depression, aggression/delinquency, and relationship success.

The aim is to develop a first principles, physics-based model of the Sun-Earth system with the capability of making complete space plasma simulations, from the Sun's surface to the upper atmosphere of the Earth.  The starting point will be an existing coupled modeling system in which a model of the magnetosphere and solar wind is coupled to a model of the inner magnetosphere and an upper atmosphere model.  Data assimilation will be based on a Kalman filter approach.  Variability in initial conditions that cannot be directly constrained by data will be estimated from ensembles of runs, characterized by a statistical sub-space identification technique, and then modeled by an empirical stochastic model.  The stochastic model will be combined with the deterministic model to produce a hybrid model that will then be the basis of the main data assimilative model.  The modeling system will be implemented following Open Grid Services Architecture design protocols so that it can be run on a distributed computational grid.  One of the goals is to develop an adaptive system that can respond to significant events in the magnetosphere by incorporating additional computational grid resources as required.  If successful, this research could lead to better tools for forecasting space weather.  In addition, the project includes partnerships with developers of educational tools for formal and informal education to create teaching resources on the topic of space weather for use in K-12 schools and science museums.  The project also includes links with teaching faculty at undergraduate institutions so that data and research results can be integrated into courses on space physics.",Tamas Gombosi|

To characterize baseline vs.  anomalous behavior of the Internet requires deployment of collaborative data collection, anomaly detection and pattern recognition for complex large scale systems. The  project combines the forces of leading researchers in three complementary disciplines: (i) networking and data collection; (ii) statistical data analysis and signal processing; (iii) decentralized decision-making. The research goes well beyond the state-of-the art anomaly detection for centrally administered networks. In particular tools and practical data sharing algorithms are being developed for detecting coordinated intrusions,  distributed denial of service attacks, and quality-of-service degradations in decentralized networks such as the Internet.  The project also includes activities with broader impact including: creation of a public network anomaly database, K-12 educational outreach, and  university-industry collaborations.  The research approach is based on a modular and distributed monitoring paradigm that is organized into a three level hierarchy: local level measurement of data from servers, routers and switches; intermediate level data analysis and processing of end-to-end traffic measurements, summary statistics and alarms transmitted from the local level; and upper level decision-making and processing of information transmitted from the intermediate level.  This modular structure is scalable to large networks of monitoring sites. However, this structure  also imposes constraints on data analysis which requires development of new  > approaches. Three approaches are being pursued: distributed spatio-temporal data analysis using wavelets over graphs; event detection and  classification using distributed pattern analysis and learning; and multi-site event correlation using discrete event dynamical systems and decentralized stochastic systems.",Alfred Hero|Demosthenis Teneketzis|Stephane Lafortune

Combating the reality of poor student-to-computer ratio in schools and occasional access to technology, handheld computers (sometimes referred to as PDAs) offer an intriguing, more pervasive solution to the computer access problem given their increasing functionality and decreasing costs.  However, technology aimed at learning must also be supportive of learner needs and be designed from a learner-centered perspective to develop scaffolds for those tools, with software features (e.g., prompts, process maps) that physically realize literature-based conceptual scaffolding strategies (e.g., ""visualize complex tasks"") aimed at supporting learners to mindfully do and learn complex new activities and content.   This project explores the design and assessment of effective scaffolds for handheld-based software tools in the context of science education.  While a significant research community has explored desktop-based scaffolds, we lack similar design information for handheld-based scaffolds.  User interface design decisions for desktop computers do not necessarily ""scale down"" to handheld computers due to differences in screen size, input methods, processor speed, etc., so new design guidelines are needed to develop handheld-based scaffolds.  In this study the PIs will engage in an established learner-centered design methodology to design scaffolds for four handheld-based science tools.  They will classroom test those tools in Detroit middle schools, and assess the impact of those scaffolds on student science work.  Design guidelines will be coupled with assessment about the ""effects with"" the scaffolds (i.e., how do students work with the individual scaffolds to do their work?) and the ""effects of"" the scaffolds (i.e., what did students learn after using the scaffolded tools?).  The main outcome will be to develop and articulate design guidelines about scaffolds for handheld computers.       Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the proposed work are: to impact HCI research by shedding light on effective and ineffective user interface decisions for the ""non-desktop"" computational devices that are becoming more prevalent, and also by distilling a set of design guidelines that articulate different scaffolding approaches for handheld tools and assessment information (from classroom testing) describing the impact those scaffolds had on learners; to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training and learning by integrating research activities into science education and teaching at the K-12 level: to broaden participation of under-represented groups by bringing innovative technologies to under-represented classrooms in the Detroit Public Schools; and to enhance scientific and technological understanding by disseminating the resulting software, curricula, and assessment information to teachers, school board members, and other educational policy makers.",Christopher Quintana|Elliot Soloway|Joseph Krajcik

Global production of concrete drives huge flows of material between natural and human systems. The shear magnitude of this material flow, which exceeds 12 billion tons each year, causes significant societal impacts. For example, concrete-based infrastructure projects require major investments of public capital, trigger enormous greenhouse gas emissions from cement production, and lead to construction-related traffic congestion resulting in pollution and lost productivity. Developments of new materials to supplement or replace concrete to improve the performance characteristics typically do not address the broad economic, environmental, and social consequences. This project will address this shortcoming by developing a novel framework for sustainable design that integrates microstructure tailoring with life cycle analysis. The project explores engineered cementitious composites (ECC) both from a technical design standpoint and from the health, economics, and policy perspectives.        The project includes micro-scale research on the development of ECC, macro-scale application of ECC to bridge decks, roadways, and pipes, incorporation of recycled materials, measurement of life-cycle impacts, and investigation at different geographic scopes. This work encompasses multi-disciplinary perspectives including civil and materials engineering, geology, environmental health sciences, industrial ecology, environmental economics, and public policy. Among the issues to be explored are the impacts of sourcing alternatives (superquarries vs. smaller mines) and location of infrastructure projects (urban vs. rural, and U.S. vs. China). Given the inherent design complexity, researchers will incorporate uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their quantitative models to ensure that results are sufficiently robust to support effective decision-making in the adoption of new materials. The University of Michigan team will collaborate with researchers at the Tohoku University in Japan, who will investigate the use of CO2 hardening process on the ECC mixes; researchers at Tsinghua University in China who will use the life cycle model to assess sustainability performance of infrastructure systems in China, and Stanford University. Educational outreach will be facilitated through a web-based educational resource compendium, as well as through a series of workshops involving the global partners.

Despite repeated calls for improved scholarship and more empirically grounded policy recommendations, the field been constrained by what scholars have been able to measure: characteristics of the learning opportunities themselves; teacher attitudes and beliefs which result from those opportunities; and, to some extent, teacher practices which emerge after such encounters.   Typically left unmeasured, however, is a component which mediates each of these and is itself a significant target of many interventions, namely, teachers' content knowledge.  The project proposed here would aim to help redress this problem in the area of K-8 mathematics, building on previous work to continue developing measures of teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching. These measures will then be made available to MSP mathematics projects in hopes of improving the evaluation of those with programs for teacher learning and preparation.     Five categories of work are proposed: (1) expanding existing measures upward to capture middle grade mathematics content for teaching, and developing new measures in key content areas; (2) validating these measures through interviews with MSP participants and other teachers, reviews by mathematicians and mathematics educators, and other means; (3) supporting high-quality uses of these measures via tools (database, core scales) and technical assistance to MSP evaluators; (4) building a self-sustaining system of measures use; and (5) building and testing theory through piloting and validation work. As these five aspects of work progress, we will carefully consider issues of equity, both from the theoretical and measurement perspectives.  We will also consult with measurement and statistical experts to promote the production of the most technically sound and valid measures possible.     Intellectual Merit    This proposal will help advance knowledge and understanding in two related fields: in defining the component elements of knowledge for teaching K-8 mathematics, and in understanding the effects of professional development meant to improve that knowledge. The authors are qualified to do this work through their past experiences with theory and measures development, and have laid out a careful plan of instrument development over a five-year period.     Broader Impact      This proposal enhances the infrastructure for research into teacher professional development. Based on interest in existing measures, the authors expect these measures to be useful not only to MSPs, but also to others who seek to understand teacher learning. These measures can be used to evaluate teachers' learning in pre-service teacher education programs; to make comparisons between preparation in traditional teacher education programs and alternative routes to certification; to judge the efficacy of professional development aimed at improving teachers' content knowledge for teaching; and to estimate the effects of curriculum materials designed to improve teachers' knowledge of mathematics and students. Finally, this project contributes fundamentally to theory development, asking the question, ""What do teachers need to know and be able to do with mathematics in order to teach mathematics?""  By answering this question through item-writing and psychometric analyses as work progresses, the authors seek to contribute to progress in theory, practice, and policy in this field.",Hyman Bass|Deborah Ball

In stable polities (i.e., excluding coercion), policymakers have four broad classes of policy they can direct toward these goals: public-good provision, broadly targeted redistribution, narrowly targeted distribution, and rent extraction. In democracies, finally, policymaking representatives use these tools to pursue these goals in the strategic context of partisan electoral competition.    Substantively, this project will leverage and advance theories of comparative democracy and of comparative and international political economy to build powerful, estimable, and interpretable empirical models that directly, but manageably, reflect the multifarious and complex interactions of electoral institutions, of party and party-systemic structure, and of the strategic shape of particular partisan-electoral contests in determining the relative weight of these four classes of policy in policymaking output. Party- and electoral-system institutions, structure, and strategic context interact in quite complex ways to shape the effective representation of societal interests in the ultimate policies, but, as this project seeks to demonstrate, in ways that a nonlinear empirical-modeling strategy can encompass effectively.  One venue where the effects of such complex contextual interactions in shaping effective representation should be more-observable is in the composition of policymaking activity, particularly in the redistributive (broadly targeted) versus distributive (narrowly targeted) share of budgetary activity. Institutional, structural, and strategic contexts that induce more partisan, interest-based representation foster greater redistributive emphasis, and those that induce more particularistic, geographically-based representation favor distribution.     I have begun to outline such a comparative democratic political economy of budgeteering more fully elsewhere, arguing: (i) that the degree to which parties are able to act as strategic units (strategic party-unity) should determine the capacity of democratic policymakers to budgeteer, i.e., to manipulate the budget for political (i.e., electoral and partisan) purposes, (ii) that national and district-level electoral competitiveness should determine the magnitude of their incentives to budgeteer, and (iii) party-system polarization, electoral-system and district magnitude, and the degree to which parties receive their electoral support as units (representational party-unity) should determine the nature of the budgeteering that serves policymakers goals of gaining and retaining power and of producing their desired policies and outcomes. The combination of capacity and incentive size and nature, therefore, should determine the degree and character of the budgeteering I have also begun to outline an estimable nonlinear empirical model that could shed light on the multiple, complex interactions among these many causal factors in shaping fiscal policies. In this theoretical description of a substantive situation, (i) strategic capacity, c, times (ii) incentive magnitude, m, determines the amount of budgeteering we expect, while (iii) the nature, n, of the budgeteering that we expect in pursuing these goals depends on several party, party-system, and electoral-system factors that shape whether effective representation has more partisan-interest or particularistic-geographic basis and so whether policy has more redistributive or distributive nature. Thus, taking (for now) the ratio of redistributive to distributive budgetary activity, R, as the dependent variable, theory predicts that R=-+c(Xc)m(Xm)n(Xn)+-, and empirical models should reflect that proposition (EITM).     In previous work, I showed how nonlinear empirical modeling can gain powerful yet interpretable leverage on the multiple, complex interactions implied by such specifications to the degrees that theory enables specification of the functions and their arguments,  c(Xc), m(Xm), and n(Xn), and that these functions and/or arguments differ empirically in the empirical sample. I have so far begun to specify c(Xc), m(Xm), and n(Xn) in this new context as (i)-(iii) of the previous paragraph sketch, and I have demonstrated preliminary empirical plausibility and found some hope for empirical success by showing a role of partisan strategic capacity in shaping the relative (re)distributiveness of postwar US fiscal policy that supports the theory and showing a pattern of coefficients on partisan- and geographic-representation independent variables in explaining the  policy mix in subsamples of developed democracies divided according to my own qualitative evaluation of conditions (i)-(iii) in those countries. This proposal would fund continuance of this project: (a) specifying further and in tighter connection to comparative-politics and comparative political-economy theories, c(Xc), m(Xm), and n(Xn), (b) gathering, operationalizing appropriately, and disseminating the data components of R, Xc, Xm, and Xn, (c) writing and disseminating the necessary software algorithms to estimate such models, and (d) estimating such models, and disseminating the theoretical, substantive, and methodological advances produced thereby.    The intellectual merit lies both in advancing and demonstrating an inEITMlr modeling technique for bringing theory that previously evaded empirical evaluation due to its interactive complexity under direct empirical scrutiny and in whatever substantively and theoretically new light is thus shed. Given that complex multiple interaction is inherent in most classical and modern political economy and, indeed, political theory, empirical techniques that offer powerful, estimable, and interpretable leverage on such complexity are crucial. This particular approach should offer much promise for usefulness across the social sciences, where such complexly interactive causality is rife. The research project will also involve the next generation in these advances directly through RA-ships It also seeks to broaden their use in this and subsequent generations through the public provision of transparent software tools to implement such nonlinear modeling.",Robert Franzese|

Fabric development in fault rocks may also significantly influence the permeability/porosity and role of fluids in fault zones.  Thus, detailed mineralogy, mineral transformation history and fabric development are central to the study of fault rocks and our understanding of fault mechanics.  The SAFOD Hole of the Earthscope Program provides the opportunity to study the in situ change from undeformed protolith to fault rock, thereby establishing a reference for the characterization of the type and magnitude of changes in buried fault zones.  The SAFOD hole samples also allow for direct comparison with nearby exhumed protolith and fault rocks (e.g., the Punchbowl Fault), which have been used as representative for fault processes at depth.      The research approach on SAFOD hole samples consists of X-ray diffraction (for mineral identification, quantification and crystallinity), X-ray texture goniometry (to quantify phyllosilicate fabrics), scanning electron microscopy (micron to millimeter scale mineral distribution, microstructure and qualitative chemistry), transmission electron microscopy (nanometer-scale microstructure  and semi-quantitative chemistry), and ICP-OES (to quantify elemental composition and material transport).  These complementary techniques provide a thorough characterization of the physico-chemical changes from protolith and fault rock.    The results from SAFOD Hole samples (1) offer the mineralogic framework for interpreting fault zone transformation, particularly in seismically active settings, (2) test the relevance of the processes inferred from the study of exhumed fault rocks, and (3) provide constraints on the thermo-mechanical behavior of seismogenic faults.

Using deep sub-micron digital CMOS processes, engineers can put hundreds of millions of transistors on an integrated circuit. This makes System-on-a-Chip (SOC) integration a real possibility, promising new applications such as ubiquitous broadband wireless communications, and pervasive computing. The science of digital design has delivered the concepts and the tools to build huge digital systems. However, the problem is that all SOCs require some analog functions and in particular analog-to-digital conversion circuits (ADCs). The challenge is to implement analog-to-digital conversion on the same die and in the same CMOS technology as the digital processing. This research involves the development of new to analog-to-digital conversion techniques that take advantage of the capabilities of the deep sub-micron CMOS.    The research objectives are to identify and to utilize the strengths of sub-micron digital CMOS.  The investigators study methods, architectures and concepts that take advantage of the shrinking size and increasing speed of MOS devices, the increasing capability of interconnect, and the growing digital processing capability. Fast, simple circuits, aided by redundancy, parallelism, and digital processing are explored. The limitations of these new approaches are analyzed. In contrast, the current paradigm seeks to extend the life of old design techniques though specialized process options and clever design.

In order to realize  these goals, the receiver of a communication system should be able to  decode the digital data in the presence of channel uncertainty (e.g.,  unknown channel quality, interference, etc.). The current state of  knowledge regarding the complexity of these receivers is that their  complexity grows exponentially with the sequence length.

Artificial pneumatic muscles attached to a carbon fiber shell provide high power outputs while minimizing exoskeleton weight.

These quantities remain unchanged after any   rotation around the z-axis. Every algebraic invariant can be expressed   in terms of these two fundamental invariants. A famous theorem of Hilbert   from 1890 tells us that given a collection of transformations (satisfying   certain hypotheses) of a space of arbitrary dimension, there exists a   finite set of fundamental invariants such that every invariant  can be expressed in these fundamental invariants.

Over time, small communities of mobile herders and farmers settled into larger more permanent communities.  By the first millennium BC, inhabitants of the Tungabhadra Corridor region of Central Karnataka (Bellary and Koppal Districts) resided in large permanent communities dependent on the production of agricultural surpluses.  These hierarchical communities were organized into multi-settlement polities centered on large towns, buried their dead in megalithic stone monuments, produced sophisticated iron, ceramic, and other craft goods, and engaged in long distance trade relations across and beyond South Asia.  With support from the National Science Foundation, the ""Early Historic Landscapes of the Tungabhadra Corridor"" archaeological project (co-directed by Carla M. Sinopoli and Kathleen D. Morrison and conducted in collaboration with the Karnataka Department of Archaeology and Museums) will examine the dramatic changes in economic, social and political organization that occurred in the region from the first millennium BCE through the early centuries AD.  These changes culminated in the emergence of the region's earliest state level societies and its entry into the historical record.    This international collaborative project focuses on a 35 square kilometer area along the Tungabhadra River on the edges of the UNESCO world heritage site of Vijayanagara, capital of South India's largest historic empire (the focus of the project director's earlier research).

Understanding such equations often requires considering  a limit in which certain parameters approach zero. While  some of these problems behave in a predictable manner in the  limit, other interesting and important problems involve unstable  behavior that becomes less and less predictable the smaller the  parameter of interest becomes.  One of the best illustrations of this  concept is the behavior of fluid flows when the viscous drag is small,  and the fluid behaves in a turbulent and chaotic way.  The primary model under study in this project is the nonlinear  Schrodinger equation, which is a fundamental model for the study of  pulses in optical fibers. The small parameter limit for this  model corresponds to the limit of ultra-short pulse propagation, which  is expected to find many applications to high-speed telecommunications.  This limit is known as the semiclassical limit.  This project constitutes an in-depth study of initial-value problems  for several partial differential equations (PDEs) in the semiclassical  limit. Existing formal theories fail because they lead to model problems that are  ill-posed and thus make no prediction at all for reasonable initial  conditions.  The goal of this project is to develop asymptotic  theories that are not based on any particular ansatz and do not  require unphysical conditions on the initial data.  Among the problems  under attack is the rigorous semiclassical analysis of the focusing  nonlinear Schroedinger equation for general data, a problem that is  generally considered to be one of the most important open problems in  the field of integrable systems.  The specific aims of the project  include the development of new ansatz-free methods of asymptotic  analysis --- for spectral theory and for Riemann-Hilbert problems of  inverse-scattering theory --- that are insensitive to analyticity  properties of the initial data, and have a ""nonlinear  Riemann-Lebesgue"" character, directly exploiting cancellation due to  oscillations where analytic deformations are impossible.  These  techniques, once developed, will also have important repercussions in  fields that are only tangentially related, for example, the theory of  orthogonal polynomials of large degree and the statistical analysis of  large random matrices.    The main goal of the proposed work is to develop predictive tools that  apply to extremely unstable systems when the initial conditions  are rough or noisy. An example of such a system is the one governing the  propagation of ultrashort data pulses in certain optical fibers, and  therefor any new insights into such systems will have repercussions  in the field of telecommunications. Some of the problems we propose to  study admit a detailed analysis because they are idealized and can in some  sense be solved exactly; however our work is also expected to lead to general  methods that are applicable to less idealized systems.  These techniques will also have important implications in mathematical  fields that are only tangentially related, for example, the theory of  orthogonal polynomials of large degree and the statistical analysis of  large random matrices.This project also has an important educational  aspect. We plan to involve both graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in  this work, and the advanced training of the next generation of researchers  is an important component of this proposal. We also plan an  interdisciplinary workshop to further disseminate the results of this work beyond the  boundaries of the mathematical community.",Peter Miller|

A fluid-structure interaction model will be developed for long wavelength waviness generation, and a coupled thermo-mechanical analysis will be pursued for predictions of diamond pull-out conditions. Simulation results will be verified against experimental observations under laboratory conditions. Verified mechanistic models will then be utilized to develop integrated process models and control algorithms for the wire sawing process.    The current wire sawing method of wafer slicing leaves a long wavelength waviness on the wafer surface that must be corrected by an expensive lapping process. If successful, this project will improve the wire sawing process to greatly reduce the induced waviness, thereby reducing the need for lapping, and enhancing the cost effectiveness of wafer production. Abrasive pull-out affects the performance of grinding wheels, and a mechanistic model of this phenomenon will aid in grinding process design as well.  These results will be of considerable value to the integrated circuit industry, particularly as the industry goes to bigger wafer diameters and finer circuit structures.",Albert Shih|

Another main thrust is to explore several notions of closure  in rings that do not contain a field, such as finitely generated algebras  over the integers, with the hope of extending tight closure theory to such  rings, thereby solving many open questions.

One can think for example of the wake of an   airfoil as a typical problem  of this type. This problem can be described by the incompressible Euler   equations, where  the initial vorticity is ideally a finite Radon measure supported on a   curve. The issue is to determine  the evolution of this curve. A further assumption that the vortex sheet   remains a  curve at a later time leads to the Birkhoff-Rott equation. The PI's   initial study  shows that a vortex sheet  in general can not be a curve of reasonable regularity. On the other   hand, Delort's result shows that vortex sheet  fits as a weak solution of the Euler equation (for initially   non-negative vorticity). However weak  solutions seem to be a class too big to describe the  specific nature  of the vortex sheet evolution. The proposed research   focuses on further pin point the  nature of the vortex sheet evolution, through studying similarity   spiral solutions, understanding the viscosity effects and  the evolution of vortex layers.    Water wave is one of our most familiar experiences in daily life.  A   mathematical description  is the incompressible, irrotational Euler equation, defined in the   moving water domain. Study of  water  wave can be traced back to more than 150 years, in which the PI   recently established    the well-posedness of the problem locally in time, that is, the wave   will evolute  without breaking for a finite time period, from  any initially non-self intersecting wave surface. The proposed research   focuses on the large time behavior:  the global existence of smooth solutions, the wave breaking-- the   mechanisms that cause the  wave breaking and breaking profiles. The proposal is to initiate from   existing theories on limit equations.  Through comparisons of the full water wave equation with the limit   equations, the  PI aims at developing enough  machinery and understanding  that lead to further research with greater generality.      The proposed research will further our understanding of the nature   phenomena such as the water wave  motion and wave breaking,  the mixing of fluids, separation of boundary   layers, generation of  sounds and coherent structures  in turbulence models.

The leading principle of symbolic dynamics is the construction of symbol sequences that encode segments of trajectories. As nearby trajectories of a chaotic system diverge rapidly, even long segments of trajectories will have short symbolic codes. Furthermore, these symbolic codes explicitly indicate various recursive relationships between families of trajectories.  In earlier work, the investigator used symbolic dynamics to obtain explicit plots of the fractal structure of the well-known Lorenz attractor, which was inferred by Lorenz in 1963 but was not exhibited explicitly prior to the investigator's work.  The investigator develops mathematics and computational algorithms to apply the symbolic dynamics method to low dimensional Hamiltonian systems. A particular focus of this project is on physically interesting instances of the three-body problem. In particular, this project studies resonance transitions in the three-body problem with a view towards the motion of celestial bodies and spacecrafts. In collaboration with other researchers, the investigator explores new methods that apply to dissipative partial differential equations with low dimensional attractors. The investigator uses results from this project and related research to transmit the excitement of research to an interdisciplinary audience of undergraduate and graduate students.    Climactic changes, weather prediction, the motion of planets and other celestial bodies, spacecraft trajectories, and the flow of hydrogen through the channels of a fuel cell, to consider but a few examples, present quite different scientific challenges. Yet all these diverse phenomena are described by the same type of mathematical objects called nonlinear differential equations. The use of mathematics leads to concepts of quite great generality that can illuminate very diverse phenomena. An example is the concept of resonance, which means that the ratio of the period of motion of one part of the system to that of another part is a simple fraction such as 1/2, 2/1, or 1/1.  When two parts of a system are in resonance, the two parts interact much more strongly than otherwise leading to unexpected results, one of these unexpected results being the loss of predictability.  The investigator studies resonances related to the motion of planets, satellites, and spacecrafts. The investigator develops methods that make accurate computations possible in spite of the loss of predictability.  The key to these methods is a concept that utilizes the loss of predictability to give compact descriptions of changing and unpredictable phenomena. This concept is called symbolic dynamics.",Divakar Viswanath|

These voids occur as a result of falling structural and nonstructural elements that interact together in a favorable manner to create spaces in which victims may find shelter. Since as many as one third of all building collapse victims that are rescued are found in such spaces, the primary objective of this research is to use state-of-the-art finite element simulations to investigate how, and under what conditions, they are formed. Other secondary objectives are to: 1) create effective training tools based on validated finite element models coupled with virtual reality visualization tools that can be used for training USAR personnel, and 2) develop knowledge that could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help untrained, impromptu rescuers as well as urban search and rescue taskforces operate more effectively and safely at a collapsed building site. The research will be conducted as a collaborative effort between the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan (UM) and the Disaster Research Center (DRC) at the University of Delaware.     Broader Impact: The products of the proposed research will be of value to building code associations, architects, engineers, and other professionals involved in building construction. The results will help them make choices of infrastructure design, space-function interrelationships, the creation of building search and rescue policies, staff training, and other matters to maximize survivability during and in the aftermath of building collapse. Moreover, the results will also be of great benefit in guiding and improving the operations of emergent groups of volunteers and SAR taskforces at the federal, state, and local levels at sites of building collapse. As importantly, the project will assist the NSF in its ongoing programmatic efforts to show the practical implications of sound science as well as the important payoffs of interdisciplinary cooperation in sociology and engineering.

Shaw  Department of Aerospace Engineering  The University of Michigan  1. Project Summary  Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are technologically important materials, because of two  useful features: the shape memory effect and the pseudoelastic effect. Their interesting thermomechanical  response makes them attractive as low frequency robust actuators and passive devices  for a variety of novel applications. The thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs is due to displacive,  first-order phase transformations (or martensitic transformations), which produce complex, finescale  microstructures. This feature is at the heart of modeling difficulties encountered in the  continuum descriptions of these materials. Existing work on continuum modeling of SMAs is  based on finite thermoelasticity theory and requires the use of phenomenological strain energy  density functions. Solutions of boundary value problems based on these functions are successful in  predicting many features of the experimentally observed fine scale microstructures. This approach,  however, leaves a host of other problems unanswered, such as the lattice-level origin of the  instabilities, the number of coexisting phases and the characteristic wavelengths of the observed  microstructures.  The novel feature of the proposed investigation is the use of atomic lattice simulations of  SMAs, and in particular for NiTi, the most technologically promising material in its class. Our goal  is to generate realistic energy densities and to simulate and understand the stability phenomena at  the nanometer scale. Specifically, we intend to find all equilibrium phases for temperature and stress  and their corresponding microstructures (twinning and crystal interfaces) and study their stability  with the ultimate objective to bridge the scales between the nano-(lattice) phenomena and micro-  (single crystal) behavior. Besides advancing a fundamental understanding of SMAs at the nanoscale,  the work has the potential to help answer why certain intermetallic alloys exhibit shape  memory phenomena and other do not, and this work could eventually be used to guide the search  for new SMAs.  The research team consists of two investigators, Professors Nicolas Triantafyllidis and John  Shaw, who bring complementary expertise to the project. The requested funds will fund one  doctoral student over a period of three years plus a one year post-doctoral appointment for Mr.  Ryan Elliott, who is working with the PI's on this area. Collaboration with the Theoretical Physics  group of Los Alamos National Labs is underway through hosting of the graduate students during  the summers. Results of this research will be used in a new graduate level, cross-disciplinary course  on atomistic modeling in solid mechanics.  Broader Impact of the proposed work: This work fits well within the current nanomechanics  initiative at NSF, since it pertains to the study of underlying lattice stability phenomena  of m-crystals from atomistic considerations. Understanding these phenomena will eventually be  useful in the conception of novel materials with shape memory effects. The proposed work not only  addresses a fundamental problem in mechanics, but it also requires input from other disciplines, i.e.  condensed matter physics and applied mathematics. The existing collaboration with Los Alamos  National Labs provides a natural framework for the interaction with these disciplines and for the  dissemination of the knowledge to be created.",Nicolas Triantafyllidis|John Shaw

How should such a learning agent represent its knowledge about its environment? Traditional models typically capture the agent's state as composed of objects and events in the environment and relations among them. Since these relations cannot be directly observed by the agent through its sensors, they have meaning only in the mind of the human designer of the agent. Recently, the PI and colleagues have instead proposed modeling the agent's state as composed of a set of predictions of observable outcomes of tests or experiments that the agent could perform in its environment. Such representations, called predictive state representations (PSRs), are composed entirely of observable quantities and therein lies much of their promise for efficient and scalable planning and learning in RL tasks. In this project many foundational questions about PSRs are being explored. These include: (1) How can an agent discover what predictions it should keep to capture the state of its environment?; (2) How can the long-term action-conditional predictions that are part of PSR state representations be used to speed up planning that is about evaluating long-term effects of actions?; (3) How can memory of past observations be combined with PSR predictions of future observations for computational benefit?; and (4) How can the flexible temporally abstract representations of state -- specifically PSRs -- be combined with similarly temporally abstract representations of actions? This project is developing the nascent idea of PSRs into a full-fledged theory of learning and planning. If successful, this research will result in a dramatic increase in the applicability of RL for building learning agents in large-scale domains in AI, operations research, control, and dynamical systems. This project also plans to construct and make publically available a set of benchmark RL tasks. This will help remediate the lack of such widely available test beds in the RL community.",Satinder Baveja|

Traditional database management systems (DBMS) are not designed to handle such applications, especially if the application requires managing a large number of moving objects. The goal of the COMET (Continuous Management of Evolving Trajectories) project is to design, implement, and build a database management system for managing large repositories of continuously evolving trajectories data sets. Since in these environments location updates are issued continually, the DBMS must support extremely efficient methods for dealing with updates. In addition, to allow querying on previous locations of the moving objects, the DBMS must keep track of past trajectories. As time passes these trajectories continue to increase in length, and with large and often increasing number of moving objects, the database size can increase dramatically. Consequently, the backend DBMS must deploy scalable techniques to deal with increasing data sizes, and increasing number of mobile objects. The key focus of the COMET project is on developing efficient and scalable methods for querying on past, present, and future locations of moving objects, and on scalable trigger mechanism in this environment. The expected results of this project may have a strong impact on emerging notification-based applications, such as emergency response systems, in which critical data needs to be disseminated to a physical mobile user based on the user's current and changing spatial location.

Similarity searches in NDDSs are becoming increasingly important for applications based on multidimensional discrete vectors, such as genome sequence databases, biometrics and E-commerce. Efficient similarity searches require robust indexing techniques in order to provide fast access to data. The currently existing indexing methods are either not suitable for an NDDS (e.g., the R*-tree) or too generic to provide good performance for an NDDS (e.g., metric trees). The main goal of this project is to study the fundamental properties of NDDSs and develop indexing methods exploiting these properties to support efficient similarity searches in NDDSs. A set of essential geometric concepts for an NDDS is introduced based on extended methods for traditional (ordered) continuous data spaces. A number of promising data-partitioning-based and space-partitioning-based indexing techniques (including index tree structures, building strategies, search algorithms and performance models) using these concepts for NDDSs are explored and compared. Other related issues including supporting various types of queries, adopting different distance measures, indexing hybrid data spaces with mixed ordered and non-ordered dimensions, developing efficient bulk loading techniques and utilizing effective compression schemes are studied. This research will provide new database indexing techniques to solve relevant issues in scientific, medical and commerce fields that require fast access to large volumes of NDDS data. Research results, including software tools or programs and experimental data will be disseminated via the projects' Web sites (http://www.cse.msu/~pramanik/nsf05/nsf05msu.html and   http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/~qzhu/nsf05/nsf05umd.html).",Qiang Zhu|

Strategic interaction in electronic commerce arises, for instance, in negotiation, trading, resource finding, matchmaking, advertising, recommendation, contracting, and executing.  Scenarios in these applications are properly modeled as games, however, direct application of game theory quickly becomes infeasible as problem complexity grows. Despite enormous advances in game theory and mechanism design, an ever-growing number of applications are intractable using standard methods.  Thus, designers must resort to highly stylized models, or non-strategic analysis using simulation or experimentation methods.    This project bridges the gap between simulation and game-theoretic analysis by developing computational tools for empirical game-theoretic analysis.  The new techniques combine gaming, high-fidelity simulation,   experimental manipulation, statistical analysis, search, and game-theoretic reasoning in a principled way, to reveal the shape of complex strategic environments. The results of the project will have immediate practical application to strategic reasoning in many domains, including government auctions for spectrum, oil and gas, etc.; complex matching programs (e.g., medical residency); deregulated energy market operation; and business-to-business electronic commerce.

The CSE Scholars Program uses a multi-faceted approach to provide a comprehensive educational environment, both curricular and co-curricular, for students, including underrepresented students, in computer science (CS) and computer engineering (CE). It permits the integration of current student support and academic initiatives at Michigan with new and innovative approaches to provide a comprehensive, exciting and supportive experience for students in CS and CE.    High potential high school and first year undergraduate students, with special attention to underrepresented students, are identified and recruited to CS/CE fields and the CSE Scholars Program at Michigan. A combination of personalized letters, career information and workshops, mentoring, supplemental instruction, tutoring, hands-on computer workshops, and speakers clearly illustrate to students the potential and excitement of a CS/CE concentration and subsequent career. Declared CS/CE majors who have demonstrated high achievement and potential are invited to be members of the CSE Scholars Program. As such, they are formally recognized, eligible to apply for scholarships, attend professional development workshops, and assume leadership roles within the program.    The CSE Scholars Program creates an intellectually exciting, mutually supportive community between prospective CS/CE students, current CS/CE students, faculty and staff within the College of Engineering and the College of LSA, and information technology partners. It provides much needed financial aid, allowing students to concentrate solely on the academic experience. It brings together the skills, experiences and resources of several university offices and departments as well as expertise from the corporate IT world. It provides a well-coordinated infrastructure of recruitment and retention while fostering success and achievement along the entire undergraduate educational pipeline in CS and CE disciplines.   In addition, the evaluation and assessment of the CSE Scholars model provides insight and data on combined student support and academic systems that can be applied to other STEM disciplines both at the University of Michigan as well as other universities nationally. The CSE Scholars infrastructure can be adapted to support students in other disciplines, particularly in fields where there are large numbers of underrepresented students. This infrastructure will last far beyond the duration of the NSA CSEMS support. This much broader impact of the CSE Scholars Program not only benefit students at the University of Michigan, but can also impact the disciplines of Computer Science and Computer Engineering itself.",John Laird|Robert Owen|Cinda-Sue Davis|Darryl Koch|Jeanne Murabito

Nanofluids are a new class of heat transfer and anti-wear fluids created by dispensing solid particles smaller than 40 nm in water or oil-based fluid carriers.  The superior thermal and tribological properties of nanofluids make them particularly suitable for minimum quantity lubrication grinding.  In this study, nanofluids using additions of copper, titanium borate, and carbon nanotube nanoparticles will be evaluated.  A new fluid delivery system will be developed using an injector nozzle to accurately deliver a jet of high-pressure nanofluid mist to the grinding zone and a water mist spray to cool the workpiece and grinding wheel.  A vacuum system will be tested to collect the near dry swarf in minimum quantity lubrication grinding.    Grinding is recognized as an environmentally unfriendly manufacturing process.  The selection and delivery of grinding fluids have traditionally been based upon the need to achieve tangible productivity and cost targets while often neglecting the seemingly less tangible environmental and safety hazards.  If successful, this project can change this paradigm by developing ""green"" grinding processes based on the total cost approach.  It can have a profound impact in industry to bring an awareness of the smart utilization of grinding fluid.  This study can also advance the nanotechnology to environmentally benign manufacturing.

This award supports computational and theoretical research to develop a new algorithm, a ""two-step"" density-matrix renormalization group method, and to apply this algorithm and the dynamical cluster approximation to the simulation of strongly correlated electron and spin models of highly anisotropic materials. The new algorithm begins with a perturbation expansion in transverse coupling having properties that are known from rigorous theorems. Well known techniques such as exact diagonalization or the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method will be used to obtain the low energy spectrum of isolated chains. The anisotropic 2D Hamiltonian is then projected onto a tensor product of states yielding an effective 1D Hamiltonian which can be studied by the DMRG. Preliminary work suggests that the method can predict an ordered phase starting from a disordered phase. Important theoretical issues that have so far resisted other methods will be addressed. These are: (i) the role of frustration in weakly coupled Heisenberg spin chains as models for low dimensional quantum antiferromagnets, (ii) the role of the magnetic field and the possible occurrence of superconductivity in the ground state of weakly coupled Hubbard chains as models for organic superconductors, and (iii) the spectral properties of weakly-coupled Hubbard chains as models for inorganic conductors.

Continuing progress in digital integration and performance is vital to the continued development of information technology (IT). As the number of transistors on an integrated circuit reaches the 1 billion mark, both the current monolithic design style and the globally synchronous clocking and signaling paradigm will fail. The exponential growth in complexity is causing explosions in both design time and cost. In order to achieve the social and economic IT goals of the NSF, dramatic improvements must be made in the processing power, integration, and energy efficiency of digital integrated circuits. Although transistor feature size is expected to continue to scale for at least the next fifteen years, power consumption, global signaling, and clocking have become critical problems that now prevent improvements in system performance, efficiency, and integration. The globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) scheme within a network-on-chip paradigm is a good long-term solution, but this communications-centric methodology can only succeed with a fundamentally new approach to on-chip communication. The investigators are exploring new schemes for global and local communication that take advantage of the capabilities of nanometer CMOS.   The communications-centric network-on-chip approach places a far greater burden on on-chip communication. Robust communication between asynchronous network components is difficult using present techniques. Modern techniques will also be stretched to their limits to provide adequate local communication. The investigators are developing a new framework for communication across a modular IC, at both the global (full chip) and local (intra-module) levels.  Global communication between asynchronous modules is achieved with robust and power efficient serial links instead of traditional parallel buses. This research also concerns new circuit and interconnect structures for local (intra-module) communications and clocking. At a lower level, wires themselves are studied and optimized for both local and global signaling.",Michael Flynn|Dennis Sylvester|David Blaauw

This work involves designing a novel distributed routing Intrusion Detection System (Router IDS) for performing real-time routing anomaly detection and mitigation.  The Router IDS detects routing anomalies by combining publicly available routing data from multiple vantage points to check consistency and identify deviations from past routing behavior.  It disambiguates uncertainties by correlating routing data with both passively collected traffic data as well as actively triggered lightweight probe packets.  In response to detected routing anomalies, routing policies are modified or the suspicious routing updates are filtered.  Overlay routing can also be used to bypass the router using the incorrect route.  This project is building a prototype to test the effectiveness of the detection and mitigation algorithms.

This challenges the human ability to deal effectively with the complex structures employed in these tools. In addition, as the world gets increasingly networked, we find it possible and desirable to access, and integrate information from multiple autonomously created data stores. Even if each of these data stores individually is simple, the entire collection may be very complex. Finally, information stores persist over time, and our needs change over this period. In consequence, the stores need to evolve with time, as do our queries of them. Information systems must be designed to adapt to this change.     This project develops techniques for the incremental design of XML-based information systems. Techniques are developed for the hierarchical decomposition of schemas and through this, resolution of multiple incomplete schema specifications considered as ""views"" of related information contexts. Automated techniques are also developed for mapping these into XML schema that are both suited for efficient query processing as well as being normalized to satisfy known functional dependencies and avoid update anomalies.     This project develops a formal conceptual basis for the design of complex heterogeneous information systems. It also develops incremental techniques to deal with evolutionary change over time, as well as with the merger (and loss) of data stores.

The objective of this research program is therefore to explore whether FEEs, such as anger, joy, or fear, have a motivating effect on the perceiver and to what extent their motivating effect depends on the perceiver's motivational needs for power and affiliation. Based on existing research, it is hypothesized that FEEs differ in how strongly they express the sender's dominance (e.g., anger or contempt) or submission (e.g., fear) and the sender's friendliness (e.g., joy) or hostility (e.g., anger). Submissive or friendly FEEs are expected to be pleasurable and have a rewarding effect on the perceiver, whereas dominant or hostile FEEs are expected to be aversive and have a punishing effect on the perceiver. In addition, the rewarding or punishing effects of FEEs are also expected to depend on the perceiver. Specifically, it is hypothesized that individuals high in power motivation, who seek to dominate others, experience a submissive face as rewarding and a dominant face as punishing, whereas individuals low in power motivation will not show these differences. Similarly, individuals high in affiliation motivation, who seek to have close, friendly relationships with others, should experience a friendly face as rewarding and a hostile face as punishing, whereas individuals low in affiliation motivation will not show these differences. FEEs' motivating effects on the perceiver are expected to manifest themselves in their capacity to grab or deflect the perceiver's attention, influence physiological and psychological indicators of motivational arousal, have reinforcing and punishing effects on learning, and influence interpersonal behavior and affect.  	These hypotheses will be tested in nine studies in which participants' needs for affiliation and power will be assessed with self-report and picture-story methods or experimentally manipulated. In most studies, FEEs will be presented as pictures, but they will also be enacted by assistants of the experimenter in two studies. A broad array of methods for gauging FEEs' motivating effects will be used. They will range from attentional-orienting, procedural-learning, and classical-conditioning tasks to the assessment of physiological and endocrine indicators of motivation. In addition, video-coding of verbal and nonverbal markers of affiliation and power motivation in social interaction situations will be used in two studies.  	The proposed research will promote teaching, training, and learning, as undergraduate and graduate students will participate in all portions of the research process. The research will help to enhance our understanding of human behavior by charting out how FEEs, which are often displayed and received outside of interaction partners' conscious awareness, shape the perceiver's cognitive, affective, physiological, and learning processes and behavior. It may thus extend and sharpen our knowledge about the often subtle, but powerful role of nonverbal signals in social interactions.",M. Gross|

Shin and Abhijit Bose  The University of Michigan      The objective of this research project is to develop efficient   algorithms and robust software for scheduling and resource management in   support of extreme-scale computing. Such computations may involve tens   of thousands of processors configured as a high-end computing system.   More efficient scheduling and resource management systems than those   currently used are needed to address scalability and fault-tolerance for   such large systems. The same argument also holds for the increasingly   complex requirements of many emerging applications. The   current-generation schedulers primarily manage a cluster of CPUs that   are configured statically for an application. An application is   allocated a  fixed number of processors or nodes (for SMP systems), and   is not expected to modify its resource requirement during the execution.   This may result in lower resource utilization. Furthermore, most of the   current schedulers do not provide transparent fault-tolerance to the   running workload. One or more processor/node failures often terminate   the currently-executing task on these processors, resulting in wasted   cycles. Fault-tolerant scheduling will be critical to the scalability of   future HEC systems to an extremely large number of processors. The   increasing usage of high-end systems for both computation- and   data-intensive applications requires that future scheduling systems must   address the problem of co-scheduling CPUs, I/O and network resources   when mapping tasks to appropriate resources. In some HEC architectures,   the placement of processes has an effect on the overall performance of   the application due to the underlying interconnection topology. Both   co-scheduling and workload-aware scheduling will be important for future   high-end computing systems.    An integrated software framework will be developed for scheduling   and resource management for extreme-scale computing systems that   provides the following capabilities: (i) on-line workload   characterization, (ii) predictive scheduling based on time-series   modeling and forecasting of resource utilization and queued workload,   (iii) transparent fault-tolerant scheduling of applications that are   interrupted by one or more faults, and (iv) efficient heuristic and   evolutionary algorithms that consider the workload and resource   characteristics and forecasts as part of the scheduling decision.  This work represents a mix of scheduling theory and robust   software development. These algorithms and the software framework in   a production HEC environment at the Center   for Advanced Computing (CAC) at the University of Michigan. The CAC HEC   facility provides a testbed consisting of over 1400 CPUs representing  multiple processor families (AMD Athlons, Opterons, Apple Xserve/G5) and   several interconnection systems such as Gigabit Ethernet and Myrinet.    The intellectual merit of this research will be to advance the   state-of-the-art in scheduling and resource management for HEC systems.   By implementing and deploying the proposed framework at CAC, we will be   able to collect realistic workload traces from a diverse array of   end-users and applications. This research will serve as a catalyst for   the development of robust fault-tolerant scheduling algorithms and their   implementation software for such systems. We specifically address the   scalability of fault-tolerance mechanisms such as checkpointing/restart  and I/O that can scale across thousands of processors. Furthermore, our   proposed integration of research, outreach and education activities will   make broader impacts to other HEC centers and the scheduling research   community. The framework developed as part of this project and our   research results will be disseminated to industry and academia through   open-source software and high-quality publications.",Kang Shin|Abhijit Bose

Ironically, these pressures are most intense among the most talented students, who are likely to attend the most selective and competitive colleges and universities, and have high aspirations. This pressure to succeed creates stress and consequent dysregulation of the stress hormone cortisol, which in turn contributes to both physical and mental illness, such as respiratory illness and depression.  The pursuit of academic success can paradoxically interfere with learning, especially in challenging contexts. Many students focus not on acquiring knowledge and learning skills but on obtaining high grades with the minimum work possible.  Cheating, which prioritizes grades over learning, is commonplace: In a survey of 1800 college students from state universities, 70% admitted cheating at least once during tests.    According to the self-worth theory of achievement motivation (Covington, 1992), achievement behavior in schools reflects students' attempts to maintain self-esteem by constructing an image of themselves as academically competent.  For students whose self-worth is contingent on academic success, investing effort in academics is threatening because failure combined with effort suggests a lack of ability, which diminishes self-worth.  Consequently, academically contingent students sacrifice learning and avoid the esteem-threatening implications of failure, by lowering aspirations, creating excuses for failure, avoiding effort, cheating, or psychologically disengaging.  The main goal of the project is to investigate whether and when learning orientations (beliefs that intelligence can improve, mastery goals, and double-loop learning goals, i.e., the goal of learning from failure by examining assumptions and strategies) buffer students with contingent self-worth from self-threat in the face of academic difficulty.  We hypothesize that learning orientations enhance learning, decreasing stress, vulnerability of self-esteem, and cheating, and improve mental and physical health outcomes, especially for populations at risk (e.g., women in nontraditional fields such as engineering).     A series of laboratory experiments, longitudinal studies, and an intervention study test the hypotheses that 1) students who base their self-worth on academics experience stress in the face of difficult tasks; 2) the belief that intelligence can be improved buffers contingent self-esteem from failure in the absence of practice but not with practice; and 3) double-loop learning goals protect self-esteem, increase learning, and decreases stress and cheating among students with contingent self-worth facing difficulty, better than measured single-loop learning goals or incremental theories.  An intervention experiment implements training in double-loop learning goals to see if it decreases negative outcomes (stress, poor performance, physical symptoms, symptoms of depression), in students with contingent self-worth, especially among women in engineering, who are at risk of dropping out of their major, relative to a control group.",Jennifer Crocker|

We plan to develop two different techniques at elevated pressure: (1) the frequency sweep method to measure liquid sound speed, and (2) the reflection coefficient method to measure liquid density. We will use an existing IHPV that is operable to 0.3 GPa and 1200  degrees celsius.  Funds from this grant will be used for various equipment and machine shop costs and to partially support a full-time technician. Measurement of the density and compressibility of silicate liquids at high pressure is a major experimental imperative in the earth sciences, especially when applied to volatile-bearing melts.  These data are needed for accurate thermodynamic calculations of crystal-melt and fluid-melt equilibrium at depth, which in turn are required for quantitative models of partial melting, melt transport, crystallization and degassing, and the mechanics of magma eruption.

This collection is a major national and international resource, serving as an influential research reference to diverse fields including freshwater biology and conservation, invertebrate zoology, medical and veterinary zoology, and paleontology. The present day scientific utilization of the UMMZ-MC is hindered by the absence of an online searchable database.  In practical terms, this means that biologists/conservationists interested in UMMZ-MC holdings often have to physically visit the collection for extended periods to access the information they require. The grant will enable UMMZ-MC personnel to enter all of the catalogued lots (approximately 251,000) into an online searchable database.  During this process, each lot will be re-housed in an acid-free environment, enumerated, taxonomically-updated and georeferenced.  This work will have a transformative effect on the research utility of the UMMZ-MC and will greatly facilitate remote access to the collection's historical biodiversity data.    University of Michigan undergraduate students and graduate student curatorial assistants will be centrally involved in this project.  These students will receive a thorough grounding in modern museum skills and work practices.  They will receive expert training in identifying specimens based on conchological features, in taxonomic practice and nomenclature, and in the management and care of museum collections.  They will also be trained in a variety of computer science skills, including data management, database design, SQL server and online database applications, and geographic information systems.      Computerization of the UMMZ-MC will return it to the forefront of active research mollusk collections, releasing its enormous store of latent historical biodiversity and biogeographical data to an eager audience of systematists, ecologists and conservation biologists, and spurring significant increases in overall collection activity rates.  The online database will also be available to the general public, a growing fraction of whom are increasingly interested in conservation issues and who are gradually becoming aware that the greatest loss in North American animal diversity has involved freshwater mollusks.  It will allow the UMMZ-MC to eventually link with sister collections in peer museums, facilitating the transition to online multiple-collection searches as they develop.  Finally, this project will also enable the UMMZ-MC to strengthen its prominent role in training graduate and undergraduate students in systematic biology and museum science by incorporating significant levels of practical database and general curatorial skill development.",Diarmaid O'Foighil|John Burch

A deeper understanding of the relationship between habitat characteristics and biological organisms leads to more efficient restoration methods for a variety of environments.  Among many ecologically important aspects of locomotion, turbulence is believed to create large stability challenges for fishes.  Understanding the abilities of fishes to stabilize postures and trajectories in turbulent flows appears to be an important and especially effective candidate towards examining how mechanical principles affect field behavior and distributions.  This work builds upon a fruitful collaboration between a biologist and an engineer and has expanded to include co-training of graduate students willing to pursue dual degrees in Natural Resources and Engineering.  In addition, through programs such as Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), undergraduate students are involved in this productive, interdisciplinary work during both the academic year and the summer. The interaction between the two groups allows both disciplines to look at real-world environmental issues in a broader and deeper sense.  An option being explored is to develop a new focus area related to fish habitat and restoration within the Civil and Environmental Engineering undergraduate degree.  This project will have even broader impacts for society.  There is considerable interest in dam removal, stream and river restoration, and shoreline protection and rehabilitation, and results from the proposed research will provide data to help inform debate on these subjects.

Further, in such multi-terminal settings,  ``bit'' is not the universal currency of information, as the separation of multiuser compression and communication is sadly suboptimal. In this  project these two issues are addressed by considering  a new  dynamic compression model and a new multi-partite graph-based architecture for distributed transmission of delay-sensitive information.    In this new compression model the information available at certain nodes is changing as a function of time. This model is referred to as source coding with feedforward. This induces a completely new dynamism in  the information compression problem.  Further, in the architecture for transmission of distributed information considered in this project, multi-partite graphs are used as a discrete interface between distributed compression and distributed communication. This leads to a modular design of multi-terminal sensor-based  information processing systems.  Using these mechanisms, the goal of this project is to   realize a self-organizing sensor network enabled with  a new architecture that is capable of performing more efficient representation, communication  and real-time reconstruction  of distributed and delay-sensitive complex  information fields than possible by any system today. This research effort is complemented by an educational effort to  train young engineers to become skilled in construction, management  and development of such massively complex information systems.

A number of design styles have emerged to meet related tradeoffs, including such recent advances as structured ASICs. However, a fundamental change is upon us with the impending slow-down of Moore's law in 10-15 years-the size and performance of individual transistors are not going to improve as fast as today, and competitive semiconductor products will have to use spatial resources on a chip more efficiently. Such improvements will require synergies between computer and electrical engineering, as well as large-scale mathematical and combinatorial optimization. The challenges to interconnect scaling that arise in semiconductor technology nodes below 180nm give us a glimpse of problems to come. First, interconnect delays do not improve as fast as gate delays. Therefore, in chips that started shipping two years ago, critical interconnect delay exceeds gate delay. Moreover, today interconnects occupy a much larger volume on a chip than gates, and therefore gates must be spaced further apart to facilitate routing. By mitigating capacitance between adjacent wires, ""unused space"" improves power dissipation and signal delay, while decreasing signal noise. These global effects have not been expected in the late 1990s and devalue, to a large extent, the ongoing miniaturization of CMOS transistors. In technology nodes below 65nm, wires become so slow relative to gates that they must be heavily buffered during layout, making buffers most heavily used gates. In other words, most of the gate-area is used for communication rather than for computation. Since buffer locations and densities are not known in advance, additional unused space must be left throughout the chip, and interconnect becomes even longer.    The scaling effects outlined above already require a rethinking of methodologies for designing circuits and systems. Logic circuits must be synthesized so as to minimize communication and interconnect rather than gate area. At the system level, global communication and global wires must be minimized. Latency can be hidden by deep pipelining, non-traditional signaling strategies and such fundamental new concepts as networks on a chip. An additional thrust of this proposal is to carry over spatial planning to much earlier stages of chip and system design than is common today. The project will develop new software tools for optimizing shapes and relative locations of large modules, and inter-module communication at the system level. Spatial planning additionally requires attention to large fixed-shape modules, e.g., embedded memories and design Intellectual Property, that are difficult to pack and may require alignment. The more futuristic part of the research will consider spatial planning and physical optimization in the context of carbon-based nano-devices, quantum dots and quantum circuits. These technologies employ radically different types of interconnect and imply different design constraints and optimization.",Igor Markov|

The project in-volves basic research, design of appropriate tools, and development of educational materials to enable accurate 3D animation of construction operations in immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and outdoor Aug-mented Reality (AR) environments. The research addresses fundamental limitations in knowledge, and includes the investigation of automated methods to describe dynamic evolving terrain, techniques to de-fine accurate resource motion paths, methods to portray accurate physical behavior of articulated re-sources, and approaches to animate fluid construction materials. The research also explores methods to accurately overlay (augment) graphical images of operations over real jobsites, techniques for intuitive and safe user-computer interaction in AR, and approaches to make operations animation in AR highly adaptable and mobile. The educational objectives are intricately related to and dependent on the research, and include the design of VR-based educational modules, workshops for educators and researchers, cur-riculum development and improvement, AR-based teaching material for K-12 students, strategies to re-cruit and retain the brightest women and minority engineers, and efforts to develop the PI's personal skills as a teacher and educator. This project aims to significantly improve the verification, validation, and communication of discrete-event simulation models, thus facilitating their use in operations planning and decision-making. Performance of field operations is also expected to improve by allowing proper com-munication of planned work prior to execution. In addition to communicating what may happen in the future (from simulation), it will be possible to re-create what happened in the past (from records), and what is currently happening (from real-time data).    This project aims to enable improved planning, analysis, and design of field construction operations. This can result in substantial cost and time savings, improvement in industry competitiveness, and reduction in life cycle costs of civil infrastructure and other constructed facilities. The cumulative impact across the $899 billion U.S. construction industry is expected to be significant. Such benefits also accrue in fields such as manufacturing, transportation, mining, and ship-building where operations visualization is as vital as in construction. The project is expected to significantly impact education by fostering innova-tion in curriculum at construction schools, and spawning an area of specialization in Construction Engi-neering and Management. The tools and educational materials resulting from the project are expected to enhance the construction curriculum, and are being made publicly available to educators at other institu-tions. The project's contributions to knowledge impact future research by allowing researchers to spend major efforts on studying and addressing operations, safety, and educational issues, and less effort on cre-ating animations. Several Graduate and Undergraduate students are also involved in the project. The PI has been proactively working to recruit and retain women and minority engineers in the project by work-ing with the Society of Women Engineers, the Minority Engineering Program Office, and the Under-graduate Research Office Program at the University of Michigan. In summary, the societal benefits of the project are: 1) the reductions in construction life-cycle costs that can be possible through proper planning and design of construction operations; 2) the effective education and training of future construction engi-neers; and 3) the career development of the personnel participating in the project.",Vineet Kamat|

This project targets the use of readily accessible synthetic building blocks - di- and triisoxazolidines - to assemble molecules that will be screened for the ability to form higher order structures such as helical bundles and helix-turn-helices. As part of a broader partnership with primarily minority-serving institutions, women's colleges, and the chemical industry, a course on ""Critical Thinking and Communication Skills for Scientists"" will be developed and taught to entering B.S./M.S. students, focusing on the building blocks of good scientific writing, critical thinking, and critical reading and including peer review as an important component.    With the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Anna Mapp, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan, is exploring the synthesis and properties of molecules that mimic the structure and function of proteins. Proteins play a key role in the functions of life by acting as catalysts, structural components, signal transducers, and molecular receptors, and the function of each protein is dictated by its unique three-dimensional structure. Since the constituents of proteins became known, there has been great interest in reconstituting the structure and function of proteins with non-natural counterparts through either minor alterations of the natural components or wholesale replacement strategies. Professor Mapp is synthesizing novel non-amino acid-based scaffolds and exploring their self-assembly into more complex structures mimicking those formed by proteins, thereby gaining insight into the function and mechanism of natural enzymes and developing artificial proteins (proteomimetics) with improved function and properties relative to natural systems. In addition, the undergraduate, B.S./M.S., graduate, and postdoctoral researchers that participate in this interdisciplinary effort will be well-trained in both chemistry and biology and be prepared to make major contributions to our nation's biotechnology research effort.

The Principal Investigator (PI) will then apply Nature's concept of using small, enclosed volumes to detect the in- or outflux of only a few molecules or ions.  Like cells, the proposed setups will use multiple modes of amplification to detect the rapid rise in concentration after influx of less than 10,000 molecules through lipid bilayer membranes.  These setups will be ideally suited to follow (i) passive transport of therapeutic drugs through lipid bilayers, (ii) activation of transmembrane receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors, and (iii) ion channel activity.  Combining microfluidics with electrical and single-molecule fluorescence measurements might make it possible to (i) elucidate the time delay from binding of a fluorescent ligand to an ion channel to the opening of the pore in these proteins and (ii) investigate clinically relevant transporter proteins on a single molecule level.

The biological lipid membrane will be replaced with a robust, synthetic quartz membrane that supports a single nano-machined pore.  In analogy to the gating characteristics and specificity of ion channels, the wall of the nanopore will be modified to attain specificity for antibodies, antigens, or viruses.

The proposed project combines preparative efforts, substrate design, and a thorough characterization approach in order to generate fundamentally new insights into poly-p-xylylene thin films and their structure-function relationships. Prior to the synthesis of functionalized polymer films via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization, a diverse library of [2.2]paracyclophanes will be prepared and the CVD polymerization process of such [2.2]paracyclophanes will be optimized to yield well-defined polymers. The resulting functionalized poly-p-xylylene films will be characterized with respect to their chemical, structural, mechanical, optical and transport properties. The project further includes fundamentally motivated studies on crystallization, chain mobility, and local plasticity in poly-p-xylylene films that exploit a range of analytical methods, such as ellipsometry, impedance spectroscopy, Brillouin light scattering, and hot stage atomic force microscopy.    Intellectual merits: Based on the CVD polymerization of substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes, a library of molecularly diverse polymer films will be synthesized. These polymers all share the same polymer backbone, poly-p-xylylene, but differ in the chemical nature of their side groups and/or their side group density. Through a combination of preparative efforts, substrate design, and thorough characterization, fundamentally new insights into polymer thin films and their structure-function relationships will be generated. Because poly-p-xylylenes do not require the use of solvents, initiators, or plasticizers during polymerization and can be deposited as nanometer thin films in well-controlled manner, they comprise exceptional model systems for the systematic investigation of the effects of side group functionality and film structure on critical thin film properties.

The PI has Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students in his research group actively working on CVD polymerization. A cohesive educational plan will be developed to enhance the awareness of surface engineering among students of different age groups. Finally, the PI will develop a pre-college curriculum to promote students from underrepresented groups and to ensure diversity in science and engineering.

A cornerstone in the analysis is to encode singularities in terms of functions and measures on suitable valuation spaces, that is, sets of valuations on an appropriate ring. In the case of singularities at the origin in the affine plane, the valuation space has the structure of a tree with infinite and dense branching. In more general cases, it is expected to be a building, or projective limit of simplicial complexes. Being fundamental objects in complex analysis, positive closed currents may be approximated by varieties.   As an analogue of Hironaka's theorem, the investigator will study whether every positive closed current admits an approximate resolution of singularities. He will also investigate the corresponding question for dynamical systems defined by holomorphic fixed point germs. Other problems to be addressed are semicontinuity of multiplier ideals and degree growths of iterates of rational maps of projective space.  The investigator will design an undergraduate course and continue his development of a masters course to suit the needs at the University of Michigan (UM). Additionally he will engage middle and high school students in mathematical activities, in particular through a summer camp at the UM.    Singularities play a prominent role throughout mathematics, even when the primary objects of study are regular (smooth) objects. An example of a singularity is that of a curve in the plane that does not look like a line on a small scale, but rather as a cross or cusp, or even more complicated.  It is known that plane singular curves can be viewed as ""shadows"" of nonsingular curves in space. This provides a way of understanding complicated object thorugh simpler ones. Other examples of singularities appear in dynamical systems, when studying the speed at which iterative algorithms converge. Working with students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, the investigator will undertake a unified study of singularities in different branches of mathematics. In addition he will develop a new undergraduate course and continue the redesigning of a graduate course. Finally he will work with K-12 students, in particular by continuing the development of a course in the framework of the Michigan Mathematics and Science Scholars summer program for high school students.",Mattias Jonsson|

Our partnership   will comprise four leading Ph.D. granting institutions in the State of Michigan, all of which have long-  standing traditions of academic excellence in doctoral education and research in science and engineering   (STEM) disciplines, as well as a firm commitment to achieving diversity in higher education.  The MAA   will feature the UM as the lead school, and include Michigan State University, Wayne State University,   and Western Michigan University as primary partners. The UM will share the many successes of its previous AGEP activities with the new partner schools and,  in  turn,  learn from  the  different  experiences  and  insights  that  each  partner  brings  to  the  Alliance.  The  institutionalization  successfully  carried  out  at  the  UM  with  AGEP  funding,  as  well  as  the considerable achievements of our partner institutions, will provide a solid foundation on which to develop new avenues of programming for the proposed MAA.  Our Alliance will be a full partnership of the four institutions,  built  upon  our  collective  wisdom,  the  sharing  of  best  practices,  and  the  assessment  of outcomes and use of this knowledge to implement continuous improvement.  Through the development of joint programs and ventures, the MAA will achieve (1) sustained, organized cooperation between MAA institutions; (2) increased efficiency by aligning the resources and operations of MAA partners; and (3) increased opportunities for under-represented students.   The primary objectives of the proposed AGEP program are: To sustain and expand upon gains made in the recruitment of under-represented students in the STEM  fields,  by  sharing  lessons  of  UM  successes  with  alliance  institutions  and  by  adapting successful programs from the alliance to UM.s institutional culture.   To develop and implement new initiatives to expand the student pipeline, to retain and graduate   enrolled students, and to prepare students effectively for entering careers in academia.   To ensure that students are prepared to become leaders and innovators in the academic world.   To ensure long-term sustainability of gains made by institutionalizing successes.   The proposed AGEP program will be centered on a set of programmatic activities that include:   Recruiting and outreach:  recruiting fairs and outreach, coordinated summer research programs,   coordinated visits of students to partner campus, outreach to potential students in industry.   Retention:  alleviating financial concerns, identifying and finding solutions for academic   concerns, responding to social concerns, strengthening mentoring, improving programs that   prepare students for entering graduate programs.   Development of student leadership and innovation in STEM fields.   Teaching preparation and career development:  encouragement of academic careers.   Intellectual Merit- Collectively the MAA partners have extensive experience in analyzing data, and   we propose to develop an evaluation model that will enable us to capitalize on our success and remedy   difficulties in a timely fashion.  With this model we will measure and analyze in depth outcomes between   different  student  groups,  partner  institutions,  and  other  AGEP  alliances.    We  will  disseminate  the   knowledge  gained  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  meetings,  presentations,  reports  and  journal   publications.  We intend to create an approach to evaluation that may be adopted in other AGEP alliances,   producing a wider comparison of effort and success and perhaps setting the groundwork for a national   analysis standard in graduate education. Broader  Impact-  Our  efforts  will  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  under-represented  students successfully completing a Ph.D., and entering academia.  However, the aim of our AGEP program is not simply to increase numbers, but rather to provide an educational experience, adoptable by other graduate programs, that will enable our under-represented students to become part of the next generation of leaders and innovators in STEM fields.

CSES coordinates the operation of more than 50 indigenous national election studies across the world, thereby ensuring that information about citizens' behavior and attitudes gathered at each site  is comparable. Under CSES auspices, information about the institutional arrangements that characterize each participating country is also collected, also in comparable form. CSES designs, receives, rationalizes, cleans, and merges these data, and then makes them freely and immediately available to the world's scholarly community.  CSES is a uniquely valuable resource for comparative research. Already CSES  data have been put to productive use - enabling the understanding of the consequences of political institutions for democratic citizens and providing a venue for the further development of comparative methodology - and much more work is underway. Established in 1996, CSES completed its first round of data collection (Module 1) in 2001, with some 33 countries participating. Module 2, with more than 50 participating countries, will draw to a close in 2005. The first two waves of the CSES concentrated on the performance of democracy and on accountability and representation, respectively. The third wave of CSES, commencing in 2006, will  focus on the choice set that voters face in an election. While we know a lot about why and how voters vote, we know little about how voting is affected by the kind of choices that are available to the electorate. This issue has broad relevance for both normative and theoretical reasons. This award is to cover only the essential central coordinating operation that CSES has provided so successfully so far, modestly supplemented by funds to provide airfare support to CSES planning meetings for participants from poorer counties in Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. All of the costs of the surveys themselves are contributed by the various national studies.  The planning for the modules is subsidized by committee members when they host planning committee meetings at least once annually; hosts provide meeting space, plus lodging and meals for all participants.     Broader Impacts. CSES serves as a multiplier of research on comparative politics. CSES makes it possible to generate millions of dollars worth of valuable cross-national data on electoral behavior at a fractional cost. By effectively coordinating the efforts of election specialists and centers around the world, CSES provides a unique resource for scholars everywhere interested in deep and consequential questions of democratic politics. In addition, because CSES is a cooperative effort among projects rather than individuals, there are important consequences for the individual projects involved, in terms of reexamining their own practices and learning from others, and these consequences are especially significant because of the large number of scholars affected by these institutionalized practices. Finally, because some of CSES affiliates, especially those in the emerging democracies, are very new, CSES provides a venue for training social scientists in these emerging democracies in cutting-edge social science theory and methodology.",Nancy Burns|Donald Kinder|Ian McAllister

Pseudospectral/Newton/continuation numerics will be applied to three species of coherent structures: equatorially-trapped Kelvin waves in the sea, Tropical Instability Waves (TIW's) in the ocean, and large-amplitude baroclinic vortices in the atmosphere. The singularity of the slope-discontinuous Kelvin corner wave motivates one of the proposed numerical topics: blending ?lters and rational Chebyshev reconstruction to improve the ability of spectral algorithms to cope with shocks, fronts, and other singularities. Also, the struggle to solve discretized nonlinear eigenvalue problems for coherent structures has led to new methods for computing the roots and algebraic varieties of polynomials expressed in Chebyshev, Legendre, tensor-product Legendre or spherical harmonic form. These geophysical problems together with broader need for improved ""dynamical cores"" for weather forecasting and climate modelling motivate the other proposed numerical studies. One is further experimentation and theory for a prolate spheroidal basis, instead of the usual Legendre polynomials, in spectral element codes. Another is improved blending of regional spectral models and data analysis schemes into global models through C8 windowing and local Fourier basis (Coifman-Meyer basis) ideas. This extends, through closely-related mathematics, to the fundamental problem of applying global spectral methods on irregular domains: the proposed work will build upon the PI's previous studies in this area.    The topics, both geophysical and numerical, are still full of questions. Why does the Cnoidal/Corner Wave/Breaking bifurcation of the Kelvin wave occur in so many other kinds of wave species including ordinary surface gravity water waves? What is generic about this bifurcation? What is nongeneric? Why do Tropical Instability Waves evolve to quasi-steady translating vortices resembling solitons in shear? Why are baroclinic vortices in the atmosphere unstable, self-focusing into wavepackets, intermittent instead of steady? Are Legendre polynomials, with their highly nonuniform grid, really the best way to do high order p-type ?nite elements or spectral elements? Can a combination of ?ltering and reconstruction using rational Chebyshev functions succeed well where one or the other has succeeded only partially for shocks & fronts? How can one ?nd the level curves of a truncated spherical harmonic or multidimensional Legendre series without the numerically ill-conditioned step of converting to an ordinary multivariate polynomial?    Broad Impact  Kelvin waves are the main oceanic component of the coupled ocean-atmosphere oscillation known as El Nino, whose droughts and heavy rains have a large global impact. Baroclinic instability is the main engine of large-scale weather in the middle latitudes. Spectral methods are widely used in almost all branches of science and engineering from simulations of gravity waves in general relativity to seismic waves in the earth to sloshing ?ows in the engine of an automobile; fronts, shocks and other high-gradient regions are a ubiquitous complication in most of these ?elds: a good ?lter/recontruction procedure will have very wide applicability. There are many technical advantages to Fourier series for regional data analysis and modelling of the weather and climate; better blending and extension methods for limited-area spectral series will therefore have immediate societal bene?ts. The powers-of-x form of polynomials is notoriously ill-conditioned; root?nding methods for the Chebyshev form will be valuable in every ?eld where ?nding roots is important. On the human side, a graduate student will be trained broadly in both geophysics and computational techniques. Several undergraduates will also participate in research, through university-funded programs.",John Boyd|

Many public policy decisions taken at the local level have implications for actors in other political jurisdictions, leading to calls for greater regional coordination. However, all regional governance efforts face a fundamental tension: local governments must give up some authority to achieve regional benefits. Local actors may then be held accountable by their constituents for regional outcomes. Regionalism thus compels local governments to ask: what are the expected local benefits of regional policymaking, and how do those benefits compare to the expected local political costs of delegating power to the region?  In other words, regionalism may be advocated to solve problems that are essentially economic - externalities and economies of scale - but its outputs are expected to also reflect its members' political and economic interests and the rules by which those interests are aggregated.    This project will examine the actions of regional governance efforts and assess how these efforts strike a balance between regional and local interests. The proposed study has three main components. First, it draws upon theories of externalities, collective action, and decision-making to generate hypotheses about how regional governance efforts balance local and regional interests. Second, it involves the construction and analysis of an extensive database of all 516 currently operating regional councils in the United States. Regional councils are one class of regional governance efforts that exist in 48 states and that represent an important form of regional governance. The database will include information about each regional council's activities, policy priorities, budgets, legislative mandates, history, organization, rules and procedures, and resources; the political, economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics of its region; and comparable characteristics of its individual local government members (14,500 in all). The analysis builds upon a pilot study of regional governance in the Great Lakes area to conduct statistical tests of our hypotheses with data from this national sample. Third, the project will include dissemination of the research results in a variety of academic and applied venues, including writing, distributing, and presenting research reports to non-academic audiences including state, local, and regional policy-makers, interest groups, reformers, and other policy professionals. By building and integrating theory, constructing a unique database, employing appropriate statistical analyses, and widely disseminating the results, the project will provide knowledge about the structure, operation, and consequences of regional governance.     Intellectual Merit: This study will provide scholars with theoretical and empirical bases for understanding regional governance, about which little such interdisciplinary work currently exists. The questions are of theoretical significance as they address how institutional arrangements combine with individual and aggregate preferences to affect policy outcomes and the quality of governance. The approach provides a theoretical framework that integrates political and economic considerations, and that is applicable to a wide range of regional governance efforts. The work is also relevant to numerous other applications where individual governments engage in voluntary collective action such as inter-state collaboratives, county-local relationships, international alliances, and international economic agreements.     Broader Impact: The proposed research is of immediate practical value as communities around the country struggle to construct effective cooperative arrangements across a variety of issues. The research will supply policymakers with tools for designing more effective regional institutions and will provide the public with guidelines for evaluating regional governance efforts.",Elisabeth Gerber|Clark Gibson

These issues might be loosely classified under the heading of globalization, and they are linked in four important ways: (1) they produce cultural, economic, and social changes that profoundly affect ordinary citizens; and (2) they readily evoke images  of the ""other""; but (3) the issues themselves are far removed from the experience of most citizens; and, as a result, (4) politicians have enormous power to frame the debate and thereby arouse emotions that shape attitudes and behavior. Rising pressures of economic globalization coupled with the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2000, have wrenched debates about globalization out of corporate boardrooms and chambers of government and dropped it into the living rooms of ordinary citizens. But public opinion on these issues seems uninformed, highly volatile, and thus open to manipulation by politicians both here and abroad. Most Americans are likely to depend heavily on information received through mass media to make sense of these issues. This project explores the impact of the political debate about immigration, trade, and responses to terrorism on public opinion and political behavior. The researchers investigate how the prevalence of certain information or cues in the mass media affect the ability of citizens to make sense of these important but remote issues.   Recent studies have shown that emotions play a central role in shaping how people respond, attitudinally and behaviorally, to the world around them. But despite the recognition that politicians and events can influence emotions, little research has been done to document the capacity of specific threats and other political stimuli to elicit emotions. The investigators test how a number of key dimensions to public discourse about globalization influence opinion formation and motivations to take action by evoking anxiety, anger, compassion, and other emotions. They expect group cues e.g., racial, ethnic, national) to be particularly powerful. Their preliminary research indeed shows that cueing specific group identities can alter responses to otherwise identical information about immigration, a process that is mediated by emotions. The researchers also examine other factors that may modify the emotional and behavioral  impact of messages, including an emphasis on costs or benefits, the locus of blame for problems, the degree of control over problems, the severity of a threat, and what is at stake (e.g., economic vs. cultural concerns, freedom vs. security).  This project employs multiple methods of data collection to explore the impact of political  communication on opinions about globalization. The central pillar of the project is a set of survey  experiments administered to representative national samples to determine how public discourse affects the responses of ordinary citizens. However, the researchers are also keenly interested in the process whereby people choose to become more informed, the mechanisms that underlie the process of opinion formation, and actual behavioral change. Their laboratory is equipped with instruments for measuring physiological (emotional) arousal and cognitive accessibility, allowing them  to pursue research on mechanisms further.  Broader Impact: Globalization may well be the defining feature of the contemporary era. Recent years have witnessed significant opposition to further liberalization of trade and immigration. The 9/11 terrorist attacks and subsequent ""war on terror"" have exacerbated tensions over the free movement of people and commerce. These trends will only continue with increasing economic interdependence and political integration. Politicians, journalists, and interest groups have the ability both to educate and to mislead public on this complicated set of issues. Public opinion can in turn constrain the actions of policy makers and, depending on the forces aroused, fan the flames of either conflict and intolerance or prosperity and mutual understanding. Rigorous investigation is required to uncover the impact of elite political debate on mass opinion, so that the investigators  may shed light on the capacity of political discourse to guide public responses during periods of social transformation.",Ted Brader|Nicholas Valentino

Students conduct their own research projects investigating changes in the economic and social organization of ancient communities in the American Southwest.  As part of their research experience, students also work on public outreach projects, which provide a context to discuss the ethical responsibilities of archaeologists and museum professionals.  The goal of the program is for students to understand how to integrate information from archaeological fieldwork with broader questions about human behavior and to be able to communicate this often complex and highly technical knowledge to a nonprofessional audience.  Intellectual Merits- The research contributes to the understanding of the origins and development of ancient village life-the type of community organization that was the foundation of more complex societies.  Research focuses on household decision-making strategies during a period of fundamental change in the American Southwest.  Because similar shifts in domestic architecture and village organization have been documented in other areas of the world, the research has interesting implications beyond the immediate geographic area.  Broader Impacts- The REU site enhances the information available to general audiences about archaeology and Native Peoples in Northeastern Arizona.  Through the contributions of student research projects to the interpretive programs at the Homolovi Ruins State Park, the project will increase the public understanding of the scientific methods and processes used by archaeologists to interpret the remains they unearth.  This type of approach is important in the United States where pseudoscientific interpretations of archaeological remains often capture the public's imagination and archaeological sites are being destroyed by vandalism on a daily basis.",Lisa Young|

He plans to solve critical science questions regarding the source and acceleration of the slow and fast solar wind, the boundaries separating them, and the initiation mechanism of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs). The proposed work will require collaboration between solar and heliospheric physicists and lead the SHINE community to an improved understanding of the corona and heliospheric systems as a whole.     This dedicated effort seeks to reconcile theories with observations, enabling the determination of compositional and thermal constraints for CME and solar wind models. Solar wind ionic composition is a unique and important measure of the thermal environment of its coronal source region, as well as the source regions of plasma associated with ICMEs. Charge states in the solar wind reflect the electron temperatures in the inner corona, and the thermal history of the solar wind can be used to determine expansion properties and heat deposition in the low corona.     This effort builds upon previous work that has shown that ionic charge states of heliospheric plasmas are crucial in identifying ICMEs and analyzing the sources of energetic particles accelerated in the heliosphere. The proposers will develop a freeze-in code to model the expansion and ionization of solar wind ions under a variety of coronal conditions. They will apply physics models that will enable the calculation and comparison of the modeled coronal electron temperatures with the observed ionization states from in situ data. The PI will subsequently construct radial temperature profiles by considering ions that freeze-in at different heliocentric radii. The results of the proposed work will provide the most comprehensive analysis of the thermal history of the solar wind close to the Sun, based on a complete set of measurements of in situ ionization states.",Thomas Zurbuchen|

The equilibrium amounts of the sorbents that the PI has developed are nearly proportional to the total sulfur concentration in the feed.  In future work a significant challenge will be to develop high-capacity p-complexation sorbents for low-sulfur fuels. Two approaches, based on nanoscale considerations, will be followed in this project (1) to use a cation (or atom) that forms strong p-complexation bonds with thiophene and thiophenic molecules; and (2) to increase the exposed cation site density.  Palladium-based sorbents will be studied because they are known to form the strongest p-complexation bonds.  Monolayers of various salts supported on high-surface-area substrates will be studied. A research plan for denitrogenation in parallel with desulfurization will be carrier out.  Ab initio molecular orbital theory calculations will be used as a guide for selecting the proper cations and anions. Molecular orbital calculations also provide a basic understanding of the bonding for adsorption.  In terms of the broader impacts, the PI has had a long-standing record of involving minority and female students in his research programs as well as having active participation of undergraduate students. The proposed research may lead to a new technology for desulfurization and denitrogenation of liquid fuels that is fundamentally different from the traditional technology of hydrotreating.

The approach is to conduct a combined experimental, computational and analytical investigation.  Processing parameters such as tool geometry, tool compressive force, tool speed and tool holding time for strength and durability of welds will be identified in the experiments.  Failure and fatigue mechanisms will be examined for welds formed under different processing conditions.  Finite element computational analyses will be conducted to understand the macroscopic plastic deformation of the interfacial surface.  Shear localization theoretical analyses will be performed to identify the weld size for determination of strength and durability.      The traditional resistance spot welding of aluminum sheets has several technological challenges such as limited electrode tip life and high probability of poor welds.  Alternative joining methods for aluminum sheets are currently sought by the automakers.  The spot friction welding of aluminum sheets is a new technology.  A fundamental understanding of spot friction welding will help the US automotive industry to quickly adopt the technology for the global competitiveness.  Due to its extremely low energy consumption, the spot friction welding process to join aluminum sheets can save energy significantly.  In addition, more lightweight aluminum sheets used in vehicle structures result in good fuel economy and energy conservation of the nation.  Furthermore, spot friction welds can potentially be used to replace the rivets used in airplanes to save the weight and the manufacturing cost of the aerospace industry.

While fundamental questions at the foundation of the theory of quasi-conformal maps remain open, recent advances in analysis on metric spaces have enlarged the range of applicability of these maps. Their theory may now lead to solutions of previously inaccessible problems in other fields such as geometric group theory. The purpose of this project is to explore current trends in the area. Specific topics of research include quasi-symmetric uniformization, dynamics on fractal spheres, the quasi-conformal Jacobian problem, quasi-regular maps and elliptic manifolds.    The roots of this subject can be traced back to Gauss's work on cartography and surface geometry in the first half of the 19th century.

Wooldridge, Ford Motor Company    Project Abstract    Advanced combustion strategies have considerable potential to dramatically improve combustion efficiencies while simultaneously reducing pollutant emissions.  Realization of this potential requires parallel advances in interrogation and sensing methods to provide feedback on the projected conditions within the combustion chamber and to provide metrics for assessing successful technologies.  This project focuses on development and application of a laser-based sensing method for interrogation of combustion systems where the high temperatures, pressures and rapid transients present considerable challenges for conventional experimental approaches.  Specifically, this work will use distributed feedback diode lasers as emission sources for absorption spectroscopy to measure species important in internal combustion (IC) engines.  Novel frequency modulation and wavelength multiplexing will be used to improve temporal resolution and detection limits.  The diagnostic will be developed and applied to a optical engine facility, where a partnership with Ford Motor Company will ensure rapid dissemination of the methods to industrial research and development facilities.  Difficulties associated with engine measurements will be addressed in the course of this work using the characteristics of the resonant and off-resonant absorption features.     Measurements proposed in this work include absolute quantitative in-cylinder species concentrations with good temporal resolution continuously acquired throughout an engine cycle, without cycle-to-cycle averaging.  The collection of data such as these is a vital next step in IC engine research and development.  Direct outcomes of the proposed research include important advancements in solid-state lasers and absorption spectroscopy along with a new valuable tool for combustion studies that can be applied to a broad range of systems.  Increased understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms important in advanced IC engine combustion systems will significantly aid in the development of advanced engine technologies.  The broader impacts therefore include the potential to design and produce IC engines with better fuel economy while simultaneously decreasing pollutant emissions.

Joseph G. Conlon   University of Michigan     Abstract    This research project is concerned with partial differential equations of elliptic and parabolic type, especially equations with random coefficients. There are deep connections between equations with random coefficients and statistical mechanics, in particular particle systems. In recent work the principal investigator and co-authors have investigated connections between the one dimensional nonlinear stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrowski-Piscunov (FKPP) equation and certain particle systems. Their work introduced new techniques which, if more fully developed, should yield the proof of some conjectures of physicists concerning the wave speed of the stochastic FKPP equation. A major goal of the project is to obtain the proof of some of these conjectures. In another direction the PI plans to continue his research on linear stochastic elliptic and parabolic equations, in particular with the equations governing random walk in random environment. He has already established some unexpected connections between this problem and certain results in combinatorics related to graph connectivity. These arose in the study of the formal perturbation theory for the problem. The main goal in the current project is to prove an inequality for the effective diffusivity constant. He expects to uncover some new connections with other areas in the study of this problem also. The final part of the project is concerned with problems in partial differential equations which occur in finance. The principal investigator plans to continue working with his graduate student on a model for efficient management of an insurance company. Mathematically the problem is a problem of stochastic control theory. A satisfactory analysis of the problem will include existence and uniqueness proofs and a detailed study of the free boundary which occurs.    The purpose of this research project is the rigorous mathematical analysis of certain partial differential equations. These equations govern the behavior of many processes which occur in physics and engineering. During the last thirty years they have also been used in finance in the systematic study and pricing of financial instruments which depend on market volatility, such as options. The principal investigator plans to do an in depth study of some problems related to physics-engineering applications and also some problems with applications in finance. The financial application is concerned with a simple model of an insurance company which holds a risky portfolio and wants to maximize payout to investors. The physics-engineering application is concerned with understanding the dynamics of phase boundaries which occur for example in chemical reactions. Both the financial and the physics-engineering models are  the simplest possible prototypes.

The first   goal is to establish Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for depth zero   supercuspidal representations.  At its most basic level,   Murnaghan-Kirillov theory asks for a connection between the   supercuspidal representations of our group and the Fourier transforms   of certain coadjoint orbital integrals.  Because of their intimate   connection to finite groups of Lie type, the problem of establishing   Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for these representations reduces to the   problem of associating regular semisimple orbital integrals to   generalized Green functions.  The second objective is to investigate   questions about stability.   For example, it would be useful to   explicitly understand, in a uniform way via Bruhat-Tits theory, the   space of stable distributions supported on the nilpotent set.  Thanks   to various homogeneity results, this problem can be addressed by   associating (as above) regular semisimple orbital integrals to   generalized Green functions.    Harmonic analysis on Lie groups traces its roots to the following   problem from physics:  Describe the motion of a plucked guitar string.    Eventually, people realized that this problem --- and rather more pure   problems like calculating Gauss sums or studying the density of primes   in arithmetic progressions --- could be understood by studying certain   well-behaved functions on the circle (or other groups).   These   well-behaved functions are called characters, and the resulting theory   is called harmonic analysis.  By the 1930s mathematicians had a firm   understanding of harmonic analysis on many types of groups (for   example, compact or abelian groups).   During the 1940s problems from   relativistic physics led people to think about harmonic analysis on a   more general class of groups, called Lie groups.  Initiated by the work   of Bargmann, Gelfand--Naimark, and Harish-Chandra,  the goal was, as   for the guitar problem, to understand functions on the group by   studying characters.  Thanks mostly to Harish-Chandra this goal was   largely realized. Based at least partially on his understanding of this   work, in the late 1960s Langlands was led to formulate his program;   this program is a vast, remarkable web of conjectures and ideas --- a   kind of mathematical theory of everything. For example, the celebrated   works of Harris--Taylor, Kim--Shahidi, and Lafforgue provide a small   sampling of the deep results it anticipates.  As harmonic analysis on   Lie groups plays a central role in our understanding of many of the   problems in this area, the investigator hopes his research will   contribute to future progress.",Stephen DeBacker|

CHP systems exploit the complementary features of different technologies to provide highly efficient and environmentally friendly power solutions for both stationary and mobile applications. They are characterized by synergetic interactions of heterogeneous subsystems; tight chemical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical couplings; and complex and challenging control tasks. To maintain high efficiency, these systems often operate on or close to their admissible boundary. In addition there are many operational constraints, such as continuous fuel cell reactant supply and heat plant temperature limits, that have to be strictly enforced during transient operations.   The objectives of this combined theoretical and technological development project are (1) to develop control mechanisms that can maintain the control system modular architecture but are capable of dealing with constraints and uncertainties for nonlinear and interactive systems; (2) to explore the synergetic application of optimization and feedback to assure both constraint enforcement and overall system stability/optimality; (3) to address the computational feasibility issues of optimization-based control for real-time applications; and (4) to develop the enabling control technology for mobile applications of fuel cell based CHP systems through case studies.  The proposed research will concentrate on developing transient capabilities of the fuel cell based CHP systems, targeting mobile platforms for both low (automotive) and high (marine) power applications. The proposed work will leverage the extensive knowledge and experience of the PI and co-PIs in the areas of automotive powertrain system integration, adaptive control, optimization, constrained control, and model predictive control.

Intellectual Merits: In the fabrication of nanostructures for optoelectronic applications, tremendous advances have been realized in the development of self- assembly methods for semiconductor materials based on heteroepitaxial vapor-phase growth techniques.  In particular, so-called directed self-assembly methods have been demonstrated recently based on the use of pre-patterned substrates or vertical alignment in growth of multilayers, allowing a high degree of control over size distributions and growth of complex patterned arrays.  While tremendous progress has been made for semiconductor systems, self- assembly of metallic nanostructures has not been advanced to the same degree. Such developments offer the potential to revolutionize the development of future media for ultra-high-density magnetic recording.  The primary goal of the project is to advance the state of the art in multiscale computational materials science through development of a suite of tools for predictive modeling of directed self- assembly.  These tools will be utilized to build fundamental understanding of important microscopic and continuum-level phenomena governing nanoscale self-assembly.  Although the computational tools to be developed are general and will have application beyond the systems studied, the feasibility of our approach in applications to specific systems will be demonstrated for the well-studied magnetic material systems Fe/Mo and Fe/W.   We propose an integrated approach by joining forces of computational experts from the European Community and the United States, spanning the atomistic to the continuum scales. The work will involve ab initio calculations of surface energies, surface stress, and surface diffusion coefficients, as well as statistical mechanics, mesoscopic and continuum calculations of the evolution of nanostructural morphology and composition of dots during both deposition and annealing, and the resulting self-assembly.  By parameter passing, each effort will feed into the other, as the information at the smaller scale will be employed in the larger scale calculations, enabling us to bridge a wide range of length and time scales.  Using this approach, we can address questions such as how the interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic effects lead to nanostructural formation and what  controls the spatial and size distributions of the dots.  Answers to these questions are not only of fundamental interest but also allow us to provide insights into processes that produce large-scale self-organized arrays of magnetic dots. To fulfill these specific tasks, we combine modern computational tools, like phase-field models, homogenization techniques and asymptotic expansions with state- of-the-art computational methods, such as multigrid solvers, adaptive and composite finite elements and parallel kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, in collaboration with an experimental partner in EU, the models will be subjected to sharp and intensive tests and validation on the model systems.  Broader Impacts: The major impacts on the community at large are two-fold: (1) New intensive summer courses on crystal and epitaxial growth for gifted high school students in both US and Europe, and (2) managed and conscientious effort by every one of the PIs to include undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds in this project.  The US summer school will be offered in cooperation with the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) at the University of California, Irvine and will be planned and taught by all of the PIs in the US. The EC counterpart will also offer a similar program at CEASAR.  Several of the PIs have experience with planning and executing such programs.  To ensure diversity in recruitment, one of the PIs (Thornton) will be in charge of contacting high school teachers and researchers  at targeted schools directly to identify talents in under-represented groups.  In addition, PIs will attend and judge local science fairs at the high school level and utilize such forums as a ground for outreach activities.",Katsuyo Thornton|Peter Voorhees|John Lowengrub|Mark Asta

While the UM, MSU,  WSU and WMU have demonstrated a deep commitment to increasing the diversity and  excellence of their student bodies and have had long-standing collaborations with one  another, they realize that the greatest gains will be achieved by formally allying. The  mission of the MI-LSAMP not only supports the National Science Foundations strategic  goal to help create ira diverse, competitive and globally-engaged U.S. workforce of  scientists, engineers, technologists, and well-prepared citizens,lr it supports goals set forth  by the Michigans Cherry Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth.ln  The overall goals for the MI-LSAMP are to:  1. Significantly increase the number of URM students earning baccalaureate degrees  from MI-LSAMP partners. An aggressive but balanced plan has been devised to  increase the number of URM students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields  by 50% in 5 years, and 100% in 10 years. Programmatic activities focus on  increasing the recruitment of new and transfer URM students, and increasing their  graduation rates as a consequence of participation in Science, Engineering and Math  Pre-First Year programs, research projects sponsored by the Michigan Undergraduate  Research Consortium, internships and co-ops, and residential learning programs.  2. Institutionalize MI-LSAMP strategies and practices. Programmatic activities will be  evaluated and the most effective and efficient of these will be institutionalized in an  effort to sustain, beyond the NSF funding period, growth in the number of URM  students earning STEM degrees. In addition, MI-LSAMP offices, drop-in centers and  learning centers will become permanent fixtures on each of the alliance campuses.  3. Contribute to a significant increase in the number of under-represented minority  students earning baccalaureate degrees in the State of Michigan and nationally.  Successful completion of project will result in nearly a 50% increase in the number of  URM students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields within the State of  Michigan. iiBest practicesla of the MI-LSAMP will be attractive for adoption and  could significantly improve national efforts to increase production in the STEM  fields.  4. Increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in STEM fields. The MI-  LSAMP will collaborate with the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), a recently  established partnership of the same institutions, to ensure that students earning  baccalaureate degrees are prepared for, and aware of opportunities to pursue  advanced studies in STEM fields.  The intellectual merit and broader impact of this project goes beyond increasing the  number of URM students graduating in STEM fields and dissemination of effective and  efficient MI-LSAMP programs. The MI-LSAMP will expand outreach to the pre-college  community, increase the persistence of STEM majors, increase faculty involvement in  mentoring URM students, promote collaboration among faculty at Michigan institutions  of higher education, and increase the diversity of our communities and workforce.",Mary Sue Coleman|Levi Thompson|Ralph Kummler|Edmund Tsang|Thomas Wolff

Intellectual merit.  The purpose of this program is to provide doctoral students with enhanced multidisciplinary training in the skills required for conducting research at the interface of the biospheric and atmospheric sciences. The over-arching research theme is to improve the understanding of the interactions and feedbacks that occur between biospheric and atmospheric properties and processes. Broader impacts include the training in this new environmental discipline.  BART builds on the unique collection of scientists, research projects and academic programs that exist at UMBS. BART training commences with a novel 10-week residential research experience. Students conduct research on atmospheric composition, atmospheric flux measurements, and ecosystem dynamics using state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Each student has two co-mentors for his/her doctoral career: an atmospheric scientist and a biospheric scientist. During Phase II, students will participate in a new University of Michigan course in the Essentials of Biosphere-Atmosphere Interactions.  Lectures will be based upon material developed for BART Phase I Fundamentals Workshops, and the course will have a new, extensive laboratory component.  Phase II Students will also have the opportunity to participate in technical short courses (e.g., in Ecophyisological Methods, Heat, Radiative, and Gaseous Species Exchange, and Atmospheric Monitoring) and a biennial International Conference.  As in Phase I, Phase II students will also participate in reading groups and Perspectives Workshops (e.g. on policy, industry, mentoring, and grantsmanship).  In addition to the residential research experience, students receive continuing multidisciplinary training including an annual workshop and participation in atmospheric and biospheric professional conferences.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",Mary Anne Carroll|Knute Nadelhoffer|Peter Curtis|David Karowe|Steven Bertman

Moreover, the deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has been revealed to be more complicated than previously expected. Powerful new techniques have been introduced to the field, including model manifolds, the geometry of the curve complex, drilling theorems, and end reductions. Prof. Canary proposes to use the new techniques to improve our understanding of the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, to further illuminate the still mysterious deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and to explore new directions for research in the field.    Prof. Canary proposes to continue his study of the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.  A 2-dimensional manifold or surface is a space which looks locally like 2-dimensional Euclidean space; examples are given by the surfaces of familiar 3-dimensional objects such as footballs or doughnuts.  Similarly, a 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. A Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in a manifold.  For example, the universe we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. For this reason, among others, the study of 3-dimensional manifolds and their geometries is natural and important. It is conjectured that 3-dimensional manifolds can be canonically decomposed into pieces of one of 8 geometric types.  The hyperbolic manifolds are the most common and least understood class of such geometric manifolds. In recent years, much progress has been made in understanding such manifolds and Prof. Canary proposes to build on and deepen that understanding.",Richard Canary|

The  main issue is that when the number of measured variables exceeds by far  the number of observations, estimating the full covariance matrix  accurately is impossible. The investigator has previously shown that  ignoring the dependence completely in such a situation is a better option,  but it means discarding a lot of information.  This problem will be  resolved by developing new sparse covariance estimators which will only  retain important dependence information, and studying their behavior  theoretically in the context of discriminant analysis. New practical,  computationally efficient algorithms for computing these estimators from  data will be developed on the basis of clustering and graph partitioning  methods and compared to existing regularization techniques. Theoretically,  asymptotically optimal or near optimal classification performance is  expected to be demonstrated.  Another way to reduce the size of the  problem and get to the underlying structure is to reduce the data  dimension using recently developed nonlinear manifold projection methods,  which aim to discover a nonlinear low-dimensional embedding preserving  most of the information contained in the data. Using these methods  requires estimating intrinsic data dimension and neighborhood scale on a  manifold, and new rigorous estimators for both are proposed, along with an  analysis of their statistical properties.  Careful estimation of these two  parameters will improve on the current mostly heuristic methods used in  machine learning and increase applicability of manifold projection methods  for high-dimensional data classification.      This proposal addresses the new challenges posed by the massive amounts of  data collected in the modern world by developing new theoretical and  practical tools for dealing with high-dimensional data, particularly with  the situation when the number of measurements taken for one observation is  large relative to the number of observations.  New sparse estimators of  dependence structure in such data are developed, which only contain the  information relevant for data classification.  The new estimators can also  be used in any problem where large covariance matrices need to be  estimated from limited amount of data, and hence will have an impact on a  wide range of modern applications, such as classification and analysis of  gene expression data, analysis of complex chemical and physical  experiments, remote sensing, and medical imaging, among others.",Elizaveta Levina|

It focuses on  active network tomography where end-to-end traffic measurements are obtained by actively probing the network. The project examines a number of important and interesting statistical issues dealing with the collection, modeling, and analysis of network data using active tomography. Specifically, it introduces a new, flexible class of probing experiments that has advantages over the current schemes. The investigators will study several research issues related to the design of efficient flexicast probing experiments: questions of identifiability, construction of efficient designs, optimal allocation of test probes  (according to some suitable metric), and real-time  monitoring strategies to detect and localize network problems.  A substantial portion of the research deals with estimation and inference for a large-scale inverse problem with missing data. The focus is on fast and scalable algorithms for estimating packet loss rates and delay distributions and their asymptotic properties.  Furthermore, new models for  spatial and temporal dependence that capture the main features of network traffic will be introduced and the behavior of various estimation methods under these models will be analyzed. Finally, an important component of this research program is the validation of the proposed models and techniques on real data. Present day computer networks have evolved into large, complex, decentralized systems. There is a great deal of interest in estimating key network performance parameters and quality of service indicators, such as traffic intensities, link delays and dropped packet rates, and in identifying bottleneck nodes and detecting network failures in the form of connectivity, routing faults  and malicious activity. However, the lack of centralized control makes the quantitative assessment of network performance a rather difficult task, since detailed queueing and traffic models do not capture their complexity and characteristics well. Network tomography is capable of assessing the performance of large-scale networks and in localizing anomalous behavior to individual components and subnetworks. The understanding and insights gained as a result of the proposed research will lead to a core of basic principles and a toolkit of key statistical methods and techniques for the analysis and design of network monitoring schemes. Efficient and scalable network monitoring could significantly benefit network control and provisioning by incorporating the necessary information into admission, flow and routing control protocols. The proposed techniques and algorithms will be integrated into an open source tool, called FLEXICAST. The research program will also be integrated into the educational activities of the Department of Statistics. Planned efforts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, the development of a new course, stimulation of collaborations with students and  faculty in Engineering, and interaction with the networking community to help transfer the research results to industry.",George Michailidis|Vijayan Nair

Fortunately, dwarf galaxies continue to offer a unique window into the nature of DM, as they are host to the smallest known DM structures and may represent the survivors of a vast primordial population.  Unfortunately, dwarf galaxy studies rely on observing the motions of individual stars and their interpretation by models, and this is flawed both by having only small samples for any one galaxy, and by requiring highly restrictive assumptions to obtain an answer.  It is now possible to obtain samples of thousands of stars in nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies, where it was previously usual to have only tens of stars.  At the same time, new, far more sophisticated non-parametric statistical techniques are being developed, which not only include tests of some of the standard dynamical assumptions, but also may offer ways to relax some of those assumptions.  The ultimate goal of this research is a kinematical model with the fewest possible assumptions being confronted with the maximum number of discrete velocities in all of the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies.    This close collaboration between astronomers and statisticians links researchers at two universities, including students who can continue this collaborative tradition, and serves the entire astronomical community through the provision of new equipment and the widespread availability of the data and the statistical methods.

The growth of  search as an industry is testament to this problem, but existing tools  are incomplete solutions. They index content, but not context. They  capture only static, syntactic relationships, not dynamic, semantic  ones. Perhaps most importantly, they have access only to information  stored either on a user's local machine or publicly-accessible  distributed stores---other sources are neither indexed nor searchable.  Information Pedigree solves this problem by capturing context and  semantic relationships between information items, collecting disparate  relationship meta-data to support searches, and providing for  availability of relevant items created on machines controlled by  individual users.  Information Pedigree achieves this goal by  instrumenting the flow of information between a user's applications  and services, as well as the flow of information between different  users.  By observing these transactions, we form a contextual and  semantic index over data that is used, simplifying its retrieval for  later use.    Information Pedigree will make it easier for people to find and share  data, without placing additional burdens on them or their IT support  staff.  This greatly reduces time wasted in managing information,  allowing information workers to be more productive.

Rather than block applications  during a remote file system operation, the operating system  checkpoints the state of the calling process, predicts the result of  the remote operation, and speculatively resumes execution based upon  the predicted results.  If the speculation proves correct, the  checkpoint is discarded; if the speculation is incorrect, the calling  process is restored to the checkpoint and the operation retried.  The  operating system guarantees safe execution by preventing speculative  processes from externalizing output until the speculations upon which  that output depends have proven correct.  By tracking causal  dependencies created through inter-process communication, the  operating system allows multiple processes to safely share speculative  state.  In addition to file systems, this project is exploring uses of  speculation in diverse areas, including cyber-foraging, remote  desktops, and software installation.

This is a fundamental scientific problem in which both nanoscale and macroscale effects are important.  The resulting film morphology is determined by a complex interaction between thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In addition, epitaxial growth techniques have been used to create novel materials which contain quantum dots (nanometer sized collections of atoms embedded in a matrix of different species of atoms).  The resulting material has unique electronic properties.  For example, solid-state lasers have been made out of such materials. In addition, there is hope that such materials may be useful in quantum computing applications.  Modeling the growth of such a material is still in its infancy.    The purpose of this proposal is to develop efficient algorithms for the simulation of epitaxial growth using a computer. The proposal will focus on atomistic models rather than continuous ones since they naturally include nanoscale physical effects such as nucleation and fluctuations.  In particular, kinetic Monte Carlo models will be used, in which simple rules for atom motion are evolved in stochastic fashion. The proposal aims at devising efficient computational methods to simulate such models. Our computational strategy is based on coarse-graining both in time and space, taking special care to preserve physical fidelity.  Preliminary results indicate that our algorithms are 5 to 10 times faster than the current state-of-the-art.

During sliding the way the material responds to elevated stress is intimately connected to the way in which mixing proceeds.  These processes are important to several areas of engineering including the prediction of friction, which results in the inefficient use of energy, and wear, which results in the degradation and failure of machines and devices.  A greater understanding of mixing at sliding interfaces is also critical for the development of new solid-state joining processes such as friction welding and friction-stir welding that can potentially obviate the need for environmentally harmful and/or toxic processes currently used to join metals.  These joining processes have proved important in providing safe, cost-effective and reliable methods for joining of aluminum alloys. The increased use of these lightweight alloys in automotive applications will be critical for increasing fuel economy standards of vehicles to decrease their environmental impact.  New alloys can also be created by using such processes to mix metals in the solid state.      A variety of different metallic materials are being simulated including metallic glasses and nano-crystalline metals, and the simulations are being compared with the experimental literature.  This research provides new ways of understanding the connection between surface treatment, microstructure and mechanical properties.

For instance, molecular biologists have postulated that DNA must vibrate in order to convert bending strain energy (or ""writhe"") to torsional strain energy (or ""twist"") to initiate the biological processes of transcription and replication.  This ""writhe to twist conversion"" occurs in DNA supercoils and over lengths scales spanning nanometers to microns. Similarly, the looping of DNA segments when bound to certain proteins is a dynamical process that serves as a regulatory mechanism for gene expression. Our objective is to understand the fundamental dynamical properties of DNA at work in these processes using both theoretical and experimental methods.    Our theoretical effort will lead to a vibration theory for DNA over long spatial/time scales. We approximate a strand of DNA as a long and nonlinear continuum (an elastic rod) that dynamically bends and twists in response to multi-physical (e.g., thermal, electrostatic, fluid, chemical binding) forces.  The resulting nonlinear dynamical theory for DNA strands will be used to explore how DNA supercoils and loops evolve and the vibration properties of these states.  Our experimental efforts include ambitious studies on single-molecule DNA that employ optical traps to measure dynamic response. The scientific impact of these novel theoretical and experimental studies include: 1) a vibration theory for DNA supercoils on long length/time scales, 2) the experimental characterization of the spatially extended vibration and relaxation times of supercoils, 3) a nonlinear theory that captures the dynamic transitions between supercoiled states, and 4) direct experimental measurements of nonlinear transitions.",Noel Perkins|Edgar Meyhofer

The base cementitious systems to be investigated are binary blends of slag-cement augmented with ternary compounds including fly ash (C or F type) or alkali-based activators. These blends, typically called slag-cements, are now widely used in practice.  Few attempts have been made to optimize the use of fly ash or slag cement to produce concrete mixtures that meet specific performance objectives.

The proposed research addresses topics across multiple scales: (1) phase resolved micro- and lumped parameter meso-scale chemical kinetics of hydration processes; (2) phase resolved nano- and micro-scale chemical composition and structure of hydrates; (3) macro-scale mechanical properties and thermal/shrinkage stresses and (4) multi-scale mathematical modeling to provide the link between nano- and meso-scale hydration kinetics and macro-scale mechanical properties. Nano- and micro- analytical methods, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, wavelength dispersive and energy dispersive spectroscopy and quantitative synchrotron x-ray diffraction  will be used to describe the chemistry and structure of phases and, where possible, their mechanical responses.  These micro-scale responses will be linked to concrete properties through kinetics models (e.g. autocatalytic-like).  Model parameters will be established through meso-scale evaluation using calorimetry (isothermal/semi-adiabatic) and thermal analysis (TGA/DTGA/DTA). Absolute rate constants will be obtained for the combined and distributed hydration phases.  Heat of hydration is known to be a quantitative measure of the multiple hydration processes which develop both successively and simultaneously.  Absolute rate constants will be obtained for the multiple hydration processes.  For a given chemical composition and particle size the rate constant can be normalized for temperature effects for each individual process. The rate model function for each of the major hydration processes is then scaled for amount of SCM.  Total heat development for variable temperature-time history is obtained through numerical integration, with the rate calculated by constantly updating the hydration level.   The mechanics-based model will link heat of hydration to concrete strength for both OPC and blended cements.  The kinetics-based hydration model will be used to develop a novel reactivity index for blended systems.  This reactivity index can then be used to optimize cementitious blends for a given slag-cement-fly ash combination.  Currently optimization of a given blend for strength development at different temperatures requires laborious testing.  In this study, calorimetry will be used instead to assess reactivity for a wide range of blends, temperatures, and curing times.  The effort will be a true integration of resources and expertise since the TTU PI (Biernacki, Chemical Engineering) is familiar with the nano-/micro-scale experimental methods as well as multi-scale modeling while the UM PI (Hansen, Civil Engineering) has expertise in areas of meso- and macroscopic hydration and mechanical properties.  Student exchange and co-mentoring between the two universities will be a key element of the program so that students will have access to the appropriate facilities and a rich multi-disciplinary experience.",Will Hansen|Joseph Biernacki

Put less technically, the PI will carry out several research projects in closely related areas of mathematics in complex geometry and analysis. These are areas which are direct descendants of the work of Descartes on the geometry or shape of solution sets of equations. The motivations for these studies are primarily geometric, and most employ analysis, the descendent of the calculus. One project deals with geometry related to that of special mechanical systems in classical physics (Hamiltonian dynamics and integrable systems), and one deals obliquely with complex geometry related to quantum physics, specifically string theory, a highly speculative but geometrically attractive theory of elementary forces on the smallest scales. Two of the subprojects deal with what is called the growth of spaces as one travels far out in them towards the horizon. Properties that are visible at this scale are known as asymptotic properties, and the PI will study whether certain local geometric conditions can lead to regular patterned behavior in distant regions of these spaces. These projects refer to a kind of rigidity: if a modest amount of control over the growth or complexity of a space as it stretches out to its horizon, then it will ``freeze'' into a very specific and determined form. Finally, one of the subprojects deals with more algebraic problems. This means that ultimately they are questions about polynomials rather than more complicated functions. They deal with special spaces which are cut out of simpler spaces by equations, and which have maximal intersection with fixed reference spaces. Can one conclude the exact geometry from this maximal intersection property? The point is to use geometric differential equations, not dissimilar to the ones originating in mechanics. Most of these projects will be carried out with young researchers, colleagues or former students of the PI. Hopefully, they will serve to develop the research interests of these young mathematicians. In another direction, the PI hopes as well to further his interests in molecular biology and genetics, working with students on projects to understand the mathematical nature of the information carried by genetic molecules, though this grant application does not seek funding for such activities beyond a couple of undergraduate students who might have a summer research experience on such aspects of math and biology.",Daniel Burns|

The behavior of chimpanzees has been studied in an extremely large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda for ten years.  The project will combine results of this research with those from ongoing and proposed genetic analyses to address several unresolved questions about chimpanzee behavior: Does high mating competition affect the relationship between male dominance rank and reproduction?  Does cooperation yield direct reproductive payoffs to male chimpanzees?  How do males benefit from patrolling territory boundaries and engaging in inter-group aggression?  Do males enhance their reproduction by associating selectively with certain females?  Do males bias their behavior toward their paternal kin and selectively affiliate with and aid their offspring?    Intellectual merit of the proposed activity.  The question of how behavior contributes to the survival and reproduction of individuals is crucial to research on animal behavior, but is extremely difficult to address in long-lived animals that reproduce slowly, including most primates.  The difficulties of collecting genetic data and the small sizes of primate social groups also hinder strong tests of hypotheses.  Long-term behavioral data on an unprecedented large chimpanzee community has already made important contributions to understanding the behavioral strategies of male chimpanzees.  Continued data collection combined with genetic data will fill significant gaps in knowledge about chimpanzee behavior.  Notably, inspired by recent research questioning conventional wisdom that nonhuman primates cannot recognize paternal kin, this will project will test the hypothesis that paternal relatedness affects the behavior of male chimpanzees.  Also, a more complete understanding of why cooperation among males, rare in the animal kingdom, is so prominent in chimpanzees.    Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity.  This study will continue to furnish research opportunities for graduate students from North America and to promote collaboration with and provide support for a Ugandan scientist who manages the chimpanzee field project and pursues independent long-term research at Ngogo.  An important component of the proposed research is to train several Ugandan graduate students, committed to the study of animal behavior and to the conservation of biodiversity.  Sustained presence of the North American Research Group in Kibale National Park will help to safeguard one of the last vestiges of rainforest in East Africa, while training and supporting North American and Ugandan students, which will in turn ensure that conservation efforts are maintained into the future.

Two stages of Eocene archaeocete evolution are now well known morphologically: (1) an  early protocetid stage represented by 47 million-year-old early middle Eocene Rodhocetus; and (2) a  generalized basilosaurid stage represented by 37 million-year-old middle-to-late Eocene Dorudon.  Field work carried out through 2004 in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Pakistan  demonstrates that it is possible to collect well-preserved and virtually-complete skeletons of archaeocete  whales from upper Ypresian through Priabonian strata deposited in eastern Tethys and now exposed  spectacularly in the Sulaiman Range of central Pakistan. New field and laboratory research proposed  here includes three successive annual field expeditions to Pakistan, with two objectives:  1. Recovery and study of articulated skeletons of primitive archaeocetes from 48-50 million-yearold  strata of the marginal-marine low-sea-stand Baska Formation of central Pakistan. The  hypothesis to be tested is that whales of Pakicetus-grade were terrestrial. Whether the hypothesis  is corroborated or not, good skeletal remains from this interval will greatly enhance our  understanding of the cetacean transition from land to sea.  2. Recovery and study of articulated skeletons of protocetid-to-basilosaurid archaeocetes from 38-  45 million-year-old strata of the shallow marine upper Domanda, Pir Koh, and lower Drazinda  formations of central Pakistan. The hypothesis to be tested is that advanced protocetids like  Georgiacetus were fully aquatic and lacked connection of the pelvic girdle to the vertebral  column, precluding support of their weight on land. Whether the hypothesis is corroborated or  not, good skeletal remains from this interval will greatly enhance our understanding of the  transition from foot-powered swimming like that of primitive protocetids to tail-power swimming  like that of basilosaurids and modern whales.  Field methods to be employed are standard GPS/GIS-enhanced methods, preparation and replication of  fossils will take place in a state-of-the-art preparation facility at the University of Michigan, and analysis  will involve extensive quantitative description and functional interpretation in comparison with living  and extinct semiaquatic mammals.  The intellectual merit of this research is recovery of tangible evidence of new morphologically  and temporally intermediate stages of early whale evolution that enable assessment of many aspects of  adaptation to life in water. Such new evidence is essential for advancing knowledge of early whale  evolution and for enhancing our understanding of macroevolution across adaptive zones (in this case in  the transition from land to sea).  Broader impacts of this project include enhancement of infrastructure for research and education  through discovery of new skeletons representing stages of whale evolution that are presently poorly  known. The project will provide international research experience for American and foreign nationals.  The greatest impact may be enhanced public understanding of evolution through better geological and  paleontological evidence for one of the principal evolutionary transitions of wide interest. Whale  skeletons collected by previous expeditions are now exhibited in museums, illustrated in textbooks, and  discussed in classrooms all over the world.",Philip Gingerich|

This action shows a distinctive arm motion, but also represents an ordinary intentional act: the woman is trying to get the object.  Understanding persons as intentional agents - with goals, desires, beliefs, emotions - is a hallmark human achievement.  Indeed, adults and older children understand persons in terms of an everyday ""theory of mind;"" we construe people in terms of their inner mental states, beliefs, desires, hopes and plans that shape and lead to overt action.  Even 2- and 3-year-olds understand persons as intentional actors - agents whose intentions and desires shape external goal-directed action.  Someone impaired in this sort of intentional understanding is greatly impaired in social life, communication, and interaction with others, as for example are individuals with autism.  With support of the NSF, Dr. Wellman will conduct research with infants examining the origin and development of our human understanding of intentional agents and acts.  When do infants first understand actions as more than simply physical motions, and instead as intentional?  How do early understandings in infancy develop into the later, more sophisticated person understandings of toddlers and preschoolers?  The studies combine three different innovative and rigorous methods: careful analyses of infant attention, careful analyses of adult-infant interaction, and continued examination of the infant participants when they become toddlers and preschoolers.      The aim of this research is to illuminate how we become distinctively human.  The broader impact of the research is that understanding very early developments will also aid our ability to diagnose and work with children who have early social-cognitive impairments.  In particular, it will aid in the earlier identification of children with autism and will inform effective social interventions for children with social difficulties.",Henry Wellman|

With nearly forty years of data on the same families and their descendents, the PSID can justly be considered a cornerstone of the data infrastructure for empirically-based social science research in the US and the world.  Through its long-term measures of economic and social well being, and based on its weighted, representative sample of US families, the study has compelled both researchers and policy makers to confront and learn from the dynamism inherent in social and behavioral processes.  The long panel, genealogical blood-line, and broad content of the data represent a unique and powerful opportunity to study evolution and change within the same families over a considerable time span. With its state-of-the-art facility to create customized data sets and codebooks including the possibility of transforming data into intergenerational and family-based analytic files, PSID's data archive has become among the world's most advanced and heavily used.     The proposed activities include: data collection of the thirty-fifth through thirty-seventh waves of data from the PSID families; the ongoing refinement of questionnaire content to facilitate the investigation of current and emerging scientific research and policy questions; and the continued development of data use tools and resources for the state-of-the-art PSID web site and data center that will expedite the processing and delivery of data, and enhance its use by an increasingly multidisciplinary scientific community, without regard for geography.     Continuing to collect additional waves of data from the PSID families will contribute broadly to the enhancement of scientific understanding by providing additional information on the dynamics of human and social behavior. Using these data, researchers can systematically investigate a myriad of questions in a variety of scientific disciplines involving the study of life-cycle opportunities and trajectories over time. Having a long panel of data improves the precision of the measurement as multiple measures are collected within the same families as well as from multiple family members over a period of many decades. The extended time series of data allows the estimation of robust, causal models and supports the study of economic behavior, for example, through changing conditions such as wage variations for different populations during the course of business cycles. In addition, the longitudinal data facilitate the conduct of cohort analysis as persons from one time period to another may be compared. These data also facilitate developmental analysis, as early experiences may be used to predict longer-term outcomes, such as the prediction of income and health in adulthood from early-life experiences.      Additionally, the data archive itself is a valuable and powerful educational resource. The webbased data center has been used in the classroom setting at the university undergraduate and secondary school levels to illustrate basic concepts in scientific methods, including the composition of data, how it is structured, how different data can be linked together, and how data can be analyzed to make inferences about human behavior using statistical methodologies. The portrayal of these abstract concepts via a concrete mechanism such as a computer display of actual data and its manipulation via the Internet makes a powerful and easy-to-understand lesson for today's computer-savvy students. The tutorials provided on the website have been tested in the classroom and are used to further implement the educational mission of the data center.     As described throughout the application, another broad impact of these proposed activities will be to maximize the use of an expanded data source by creating state-of-the-art tools for research and education and making them available freely on the Internet to all users without regard to geographic location. This free and open access of the data, easy-to-use data and data tools, as well as expanded content domains, will increase the opportunities for scientific progress and promote teaching and learning across a range of disciplines.     The intellectual merits of the proposed activities include the theoretical significance of research that results from breakthroughs made by the expanded data archive in the multidisciplinary areas of human dynamics and development. The project team is highly qualified to conduct the proposed work, with an average across all team members of nearly 10 years experience working on the PSID.

Because carbonate mineral solubility is CO2-dependent and reaction rates are rapid, terrestrial carbonate dissolution fluxes will change and may feed back to the climate system as well as influence the geochemistry of surface waters. Our previous work on the hydrogeochemistry of carbonate-rich watersheds in the Upper Midwest and in Slovenia shows that there is close linkage between soil zone PCO2 and that of shallow groundwaters. Both of these regions have among the largest area normalized dissolved inorganic carbon fluxes in the world. Riverine export of dissolved inorganic carbon could increase if weathering of carbonates accelerates, and may also be influenced by agricultural liming, a common practice in the Midwest and other humid agricultural regions of the world. The Mississippi River already shows evidence of increasing inorganic carbon export. The net effect of liming on atmospheric CO2 is uncertain because the dissolution of lime minerals in surface soils may sequester or generate CO2 depending on pH. Carbonate mineral dissolution also impacts weathering of silicate minerals, especially by controlling soil pH, which further influences weathering feedbacks to atmospheric CO2. In fact, the Na fluxes from plagioclase feldspar weathering appear to be significantly higher in catchment soils with both silicates and carbonates than in granitic watersheds in warmer settings.  Intellectual Merit: The present proposal is a new cross-disciplinary collaboration that brings together a Principal Investigator and a Slovenian collaborator to pursue several distinct, but highly interrelated, lines of research on carbonate geochemistry. Combining efforts in a synergistic way will broaden and integrate the understanding of the roles of carbonate minerals in landscape-scale solute fluxes and soil-atmospheric CO2 exchanges. Walter has extensive experience working on the hydrogeochemical aspects mineral weathering in diverse landscapes. Part of the proposed research is an extension of projects initiated under previous funding, including comparisons of carbonate geochemistry of streams and groundwaters in glaciated Michigan watersheds with those in alpine and karst regions of Slovenia. Hamilton has recently begun to investigate carbonate fluxes associated with liming in connection with an LTER project on agricultural row-crop ecosystems. Through a new collaboration with Stephen Hamilton at the Kellog Biological Station at Michigan of Michigan State University, Walter will extend her work to Michigan agricultural soils, bringing geochemical expertise to bear on the questions of how intensive agriculture affects the weathering of native minerals as well as the effects and fate of lime added to soils. Approaches will include the study of carbonate and silicate geochemistry in soil profiles beneath forests and limed and unlimed row crops, examination of riverine export of chemical weathering products, and experimental lime additions to cropping systems equipped with soil monoliths that permit sampling of soil solutions and gases at various depths. Particular attention is devoted to the near-surface soils and spatially discrete catchments of different land use types where reaction rates are intense and anthropogenic activities exert the most influence.  Broader Impacts: Educational impacts include training of several graduate students as well as scientific exchanges with Slovenia. The association with an LTER site brings outreach and K12 educational opportunities. Societal impacts involve understanding global change effects on weathering rates and potentially significant feedbacks. Investigation of net effect of liming on atmospheric CO2 is critical to the integrated assessment of the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas fluxes and may reveal opportunities to reduce the net global warming potential of row crop systems.",Lynn Walter|

One way stress acts to inhibit reproduction is by reducing secretion of gonadotropic hormones from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.  Of importance, cortisol, which is a hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex in increased amounts during stress, suppresses gonadotropin secretion in non-stressed sheep when delivered in amounts that mimic plasma cortisol concentrations during stress.  The first component of this research project uses a physiological approach to test the hypothesis that increased plasma cortisol is essential for suppression of gonadotropin secretion in sheep experiencing real-life psychosocial stressors (e.g., isolation, confinement, predator cues).  It then addresses underlying mechanism by testing if stress-induced suppression of gonadotropin secretion is mediated via the type II glucocorticoid receptor, and if stress acts to reduce responsiveness of the pituitary gland to gonadotropin-releasing hormone.  Cellular and molecular approaches and a pituitary-cell culture system will then be employed to distinguish actions of cortisol at the plasma membrane from intracellular actions, and to determine if cortisol-induced suppression of gonadotropin secretion is linked to reduced receptor for gonadotropin-releasing hormone on pituitary cells.  This research will provide important novel insight into both integrative and cellular mechanisms whereby stress inhibits reproduction in sheep by demonstrating that cortisol, acting via the type II glucocorticoid receptor on cells of the anterior pituitary gland, is essential for stress-induced suppression of gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, has global relevance as it could lead to enhanced food and fiber production in regions where sheep are agriculturally important.  It also impacts preservation of endangered species maintained in captivity or in conditions of deteriorating habitat, and it bears broadly on fertility regulation.  This research will also benefit professional development of new investigators by providing research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees.",Fred Karsch|

Automatic processes are an important component of ongoing behavior, because they free us from having to deliberate about every task that faces us.  But this very automaticity creates a problem for many ongoing behaviors.  Many of the stimuli we encounter and many of the tasks we face are ones in which an automatic process is not the one that is most appropriate to the present context.  This is so for encoding, when attention is often drawn by salient stimuli in the environment that should not be the targets of processing. It is so for working memory, where we often have information stored that is irrelevant to the task at hand. And it is so for responding, when we often must overcome pre-potent responses to respond correctly in some situation.  It is critical to understand how humans are able to overcome their automatic behaviors and engage in more controlled processing. For over 100 years, psychological experimentation and theory have grappled with understanding how interference is controlled and resolved in perceptual and memory tasks. For a time, the predominant view of interference-resolution rested on the assumption that there is a single mechanism responsible for inhibition of irrelevant or distracting information across a variety of circumstances.  However, other research has led to the view that inhibitory mechanisms may vary from one task to another.  How might the mechanisms of interference-resolution be similar to or different from task to task?  That is the question that motivates the present application. With funding from the National Science Foundation, John Jonides is investigating two alternative dimensions to partition interference-resolution mechanisms.  One rests on the proposal that different stages in the information-processing stream demand different mechanisms of interference-resolution.  The hypothesis is being tested that encoding, maintenance in working memory, response selection, and response execution stages of processing have partially non-overlapping mechanisms that are engaged when there is interference that needs to be controlled.  The second dimension concerns the type of information that is involved.  There is evidence that verbal and spatial information are processed by different brain mechanisms in many tasks, and that interference may be resolved differently for the two types of information. The hypothesis will be tested that when there is verbal and spatial information involved in tasks for which interference must be controlled, different mechanisms are engaged.      The broader impacts of this research program will be felt in five areas. First, there will be a research seminar including graduate and undergraduate students that meets weekly to discuss ongoing research concerned with interference-resolution.  Second, the research will be conducted with the participation of underrepresented students chosen from the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.  Third, the research program will make use of an NSF-funded neuroimaging facility that will serve as a vehicle to educate students about neuroimaging methods.  Fourth, the proposed research will result in published papers and conference presentations that will disseminate the empirical findings and document the development of the underlying theory.  Finally, in that interference-resolution processes are critical to everyday cognitive functioning, the proposed program could lead to a prescription for training regimens that may strengthen some of these processes.",John Jonides|

Examples of such problems include routing vehicles in a logistics network, VLSI circuit design, gene sequencing, portfolio selection, wireless network design and many others. Large-scale instances of such problems are extremely difficult to solve and require both theoretical and computational advancements in solution approaches. This project is aimed at development of theory and computational enhancements for Functional Annealing (FA) algorithm to solve large-scale discrete optimization problems.  FA is a stochastic local search algorithm that performs local improvement while randomly perturbing the objective function in each iteration. The random perturbation allows the algorithm to escape local optima and can also be used to guide the stochastic search in the solution space by creating bias. The algorithm can be used with any local improvement strategy. These features make the algorithm computationally more attractive but significantly harder to analyze theoretically compared to well-known algorithms such as Simulated Annealing. The proposed work involves investigating asymptotic and finite time convergence properties of FA. It also seeks to identify computational enhancements of the algorithm by finding the optimal choice of perturbation, and incorporating learning schemes in the generation of bias in the perturbation. As part of the computational investigation, FA algorithms will be developed for two important problem classes. The first class is the network design problems arising in logistics applications. The PI will work with an industry partner in package shipment industry to develop and test the algorithms on real-world instances of network design problems. The second class is the unconstrained quadratic binary programming problems. This class models a large number of combinatorial optimization problems.    If successful, the proposed work will lead to development of efficient algorithms for very large instances of discrete optimization problems with provable convergence guarantees. Theoretical results from this work would improve the understanding of other stochastic local search methods as well. The work on network design problems could lead to new algorithms and software tools for planning problems in logistics.  The computational testing for unconstrained quadratic binary programming problems could generate a powerful solution tool for many researchers and practitioners, given its broad applicability. Software developed during the research would be available as part of the Metaheuristic Cyber Infrastructure for Operations Research to give easy access to researchers and practitioners.",Dushyant Sharma|

This system responds to attacks by dynamically and selectively quarantining hosts, services, and other networked devices.   Traditional containment systems based on firewalls and individual host isolation are not adequate for containing the new generation of local-scanning, topological, metaserver and contagion worms that can spread very quickly through an enterprise.  Further, these systems do not provide enterprise-wide protection of essential services during such quarantine. To address these shortcomings, a comprehensive enterprise defense framework, called SeQuEN (Service Quarantine in Enterprise Networks) is being developed, implemented and evaluated.  SeQuEN automatically identifies hosts, routers and switches forquarantine based on their service interactions (""behaviors"") instead of the physical topology of the network. Since most viruses and worms target specific services and the underlying vulnerabilities, the service-centric quarantine in SeQuEN is expected to achieve fast containment of malicious attacks.  Further, SeQuEN enhances the survivability of an operational network by maintaining essential services when a network-wide quarantine is activated upon attack detection.  This is achieved by partitioning the service topology into a number of quarantine zones while providing service distribution and replication.  SeQuEN is also being integrated within an Attack Simulation Engine (ASE) to simulate different types of malicious code attacks, such as topological, local-scanning worms and spybots. The effectiveness of the quarantine algorithms in SeQuEN is being evaluated using network traces collected from a class-2 IP network.",Kang Shin|Abhijit Bose

The interdisciplinary research project will investigate (a) how social-ecological and political-economic conditions shape individual belief formation and decision making related to collective action, (b) how importantly and in what ways do network and social-spatial relationships affect individual beliefs and decisions, and (c) what are the aggregate effects of individual interactions and responses on the forests resources on which individuals depend and on local socio-political and institutional structures.  To answer these questions, the investigators will use data from India, Uganda, and Bolivia to build and test statistical and computational models that help analyze the dynamics of human beliefs and actions over time, their interactions, and their influence on environmental outcomes.  The research will build upon a decade-long experience of research in forested environments through the International Forestry Resources and Institutions program and will take steps toward establishing the degree to which environmental variability (from both physical and social-political conditions) and the degree of unpredictability of such variation affect information collected by resource users and the level of reliability humans attach to different sources of information.    By focusing on beliefs, the relevant dimensions along which individuals can be grouped, and the differential involvement of different groups of individuals in collective action to govern forest resources, this project will help fill two critical gaps in existing knowledge about human-environmental dynamics:  (1) the absence of systematic, empirically based research on the features of the context that shape the distribution of beliefs in a population and (2) the lack of attention that has been given to determining how the distribution of beliefs in a population shapes collective action to govern resources.  By focusing on human-environment interactions related to forest resources in specific sites, the project aims to shed new light on questions that are important to theoretical development as well as the design and implementation of public policy.  The ecological and social processes on which the project focuses underpin resource governance outcomes for hundreds of thousands of households all over the world.  The project will permit an examination of interactions between resource governance policies, human livelihoods, changes in human beliefs, and the decision making of agents related to collective action.

The hypothesis is that sacred values - which encompass aspects of what philosophers, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists and psychologists call moral, non-instrumental or protected values - are critical in generating and sustaining culturally distinct and often conflicting political and resource-management systems that people deem essential to cultural survival. To better understand and deal with this issue, the research: 1) provides a comprehensive theoretical framework and wide-ranging empirical analysis of the role of sacred values in judgment and decision making, and 2) shows how sacred values inform issues relating to cultural conflict. Results are geared to: 3) further possibilities for negotiation and adjudication of conflicting values over transcultural boundaries, and 4) reduce the threat of violence as people attempt to implement these values in an increasingly global competition for political, social and economic resources.    Current risk management approaches to resolving resource conflicts or countering terrorism often assume adversaries model the world on the basis of rational choices that are commensurable across cultures. Such assumptions are prevalent in risk assessment and modeling by foreign aid and international development projects run by institutions such as the World Bank and many NGOs, and by U.S. diplomatic, military and intelligence services as well. Psychological experiments, anthropological fieldwork and political science surveys relating to social conflicts over natural resources and terrorism encourage exploration of whether culturally distinct value frameworks constrain preferences and choices in ways not readily translatable (fungible, substitutable) across frameworks.

Learning how to regulate emotional states is fundamental to successful functioning in any society.  Children who do not learn to regulate their emotional states and behaviors during the preschool period are at high risk of psychopathology and numerous problems later in life. Emotion regulation involves coordination across behavioral, psychological, and physiological subsystems that develop over time.  Research into the development of each of these subsystems has made significant progress in the past decade, but regulation of this system as a whole is not well understood.  In this project, both complex systems and statistical modeling techniques will be used to examine how children engage in regulatory processes across 3 key domains: physiological (salivary cortisol and heart rate systems); behavioral (motor activity and facial/body expressions of emotion); and moderating factors (gender, temperament, inhibition and executive functioning abilities; parent emotionality and emotion socialization practices; and culture); and under 2 conditions: at baseline (over a period of 3 days) and in response to a stressful experience.  A secondary aim is to examine group differences in temperament, executive functioning, and behavioral and physiological reactivity for our Chinese and U.S. parent and child samples to more fully understand the influence of culture as a ""regulatory"" variable. In contrast to previous studies in which only one or two domains were considered at isolated points in time, the proposed study will examine four domains (two physiologic and two behavioral) simultaneously and densely sampled over time.  In addition to the integration of biological and behavioral data, a key component of the project is the interaction and integration of the dynamic systems and statistical modeling techniques.  By working closely together, the dynamic systems theorists and the statisticians can treat different variables as inputs or outputs, fixed or adaptive, independent or dependent, to determine the best overall model of emotion regulation for these data. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the new knowledge that will be generated from this project about the process of emotional regulation, in children who are still learning to regulate their emotions.  It will generate new data on potential cultural differences in both physiological and behavioral components of emotion regulation, as well as a new integrative approach for modeling these data.  The dynamic and complex systems models that are developed as part of this project will allow for a deeper understanding of the feedback mechanisms and interrelationships inherent across the multiple domains and time scales of emotional reaction and regulation.  This, together with our richly sampled data has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift in research on emotion regulation.  Broader impacts of this project include deeper understanding of emotion regulation processes that can be used to inform treatment of emotion regulation problems at an early age.  In addition, the interdisciplinary interactions in the project (between psychology, pediatrics, kinesiology, biostatistics and engineering) will allow each discipline to learn from the others and to generate new knowledge at the intersections and gaps between the disciplines.  Internationally, it will strengthen collaborations both within and across disciplines between US and Chinese researchers. Importantly, results from this project will also be incorporated into courses not only into different departments, but in very different schools/colleges, across the University of Michigan campus.  Results from this study will also be packaged into Matlab teaching modules for use in Dynamic Control Systems classes and disseminated to other universities over the world-wide web.",Twila Tardif|Dawn Tilbury|Sherry Olson|Barbara Felt

Logic controllers are used for many applications such as manufacturing systems, satellites, autonomous robots, and active databases.  At a low level, a logic controller is simply a set of rules.  However, when hundreds or thousands of these rules are acting together in a complex system, unexpected or undesirable behavior can occur.  This project will develop modular verification technologies that will allow much more complex systems to be verified than are possible with existing centralized techniques.  It will also investigate whether some properties of a system cannot be verified in a modular fashion, thus giving insight into the distinction between global and local properties of logic control systems.    As systems become more complex -- for example, cars with antilock brakes, electronic stability control, and four-wheel steering; or telephones with call waiting, call forwarding, and caller ID - the various new features can interfere with each other.  This feature interference can cause unexpected behaviors to occur in the system, called ""automation surprises.""  Because of the complexity, it is impossible for the designer to imagine all possible combinations of environmental factors and user commands and check that the system behaves as desired. This project will develop methods and techniques to automatically verify that complex systems operate in a correct and safe manner.

Aging effects in sand, such as increases in penetration resistance with time after deposition, densification, and/or liquefaction, are known to occur in-situ, but the causes of these effects are not fully understood.  Nonetheless, these effects have important ramifications in earthquake engineering.  First, the lack of understanding of the phenomenon is an impediment to quality assurance (QA) for ground densification projects aimed at mitigating the damaging effects of liquefaction.  Also, aging effects introduce considerable uncertainty in field-based liquefaction susceptibility correlations, as the influence of aging on the in-situ test indices used to develop correlations is unknown but certainly varied among the case histories in the liquefaction database.  Within the realm of probabilistic based earthquake engineering (PBEE), a probabilistic quantification of the influence of aging on in-situ indices is required.   Previous investigations into the underlying mechanisms of aging of sands have been inconclusive, sometimes raising more questions than resolving.  Unfortunately, the boundary conditions for most published field studies have been too numerous and variable to conclusively identify the mechanisms underlying aging.  Nevertheless, the results of such field studies add to the evidence that the aging phenomenon exists.  Building on the lessons learned from previous studies, this research entails synergistic field and laboratory investigations to be performed collaboratively by the University of Michigan and by the University of Rhode Island.  Also included on the research team is Dr. Wilhelm Degen, Senior Vice President, Vibrofoundation, Inc., who will be donating equipment time and expertise and Dr. James K. Mitchell (Virginia Tech), one of the foremost experts on the aging phenomenon.  The field investigation will involve inducing liquefaction by explosives, vibroflotation, and vibroseis at adjacent locations. The former two techniques were selected because they are ground densification methods in which the aging phenomenon has been observed.  However, both methods introduce foreign elements into the soil: explosives - blast gases; vibroflotation - heavily aerated water.  On the contrary, the vibroseis (NEES equipment), only introduces seismic waves into the ground, and thus, will allow discernment of the contribution of blast gases and heavily aerated water on the aging phenomenon.  In conjunction with the field investigation, an aging study will be performed in the laboratory using soil and groundwater from the field site, with the purpose of discerning the scale and different stress state effects on aging.    There are several broader impacts stemming from the proposed research.  For society at large, this research will help minimize losses from earthquakes by improving the current methods for liquefaction risk assessment and mitigation.  Technology transfer will be ensured, as the corporate partner will have input on the testing plan, as well as direct access to the research findings, with other interested parties having access to the data/findings via the NEESgrid.  The educational impacts will not only result from the increased technical understanding of the subject matter, but will also result from the collaborative nature of the proposed research and the educational outreach program with Bates Elementary School, Dexter, Michigan.

Wight, University of Michigan Ann Arbor     It is proposed to use NEES testing facilities and associated simulation capabilities to develop new coupled wall systems and retrofit schemes for framed construction through the use of high-performance fiber reinforced cement composites (HPFRCC). This research was conceived from the idea that the next generation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures should utilize ductile cementitious materials in critical regions, rather than extensive reinforcement detailing to provide shear resistance and concrete confinement. A high-performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite (HPFRCC) that is ductile in tension, does not spall in compression, behaves like a confined concrete, and is capable of providing confinement to normal reinforcement, will be used. In addition to enhancing confinement and flexural behavior in plastic hinging regions, HPFRCC materials are capable of providing ductility and energy dissipation capabilities to shear critical members that are normally a difficult design issue for RC structures. The use of HPFRCC materials for such members will lead to less complicated reinforcement details, will be easier to construct, and will provide a high degree of damage tolerance, leading to superior seismic performance and reduced post-earthquake repair costs. The research will be conducted by a diverse and multidisciplinary team from three major universities, Michigan, Stanford and Illinois, with expertise in structural engineering, computational simulation, materials engineering, information technology and cyberinfrastructure deployment. Cooperative assistance with computation and simulation requirements has been offered by the MGRID and Sakai research groups at the University of Michigan.     Intellectual Merit: HPFRCC materials will be used as a tool to develop new coupling beam designs for RC structural wall systems and infill panels for seismic retrofitting of existing steel or RC framed structures. Shear wall systems are very popular for medium-rise structures in zones of high seismicity and the development of a coupling beam that is easier to construct than current diagonal reinforcing schemes, yet still can sustain large shear stress and displacement demands with good stiffness retention, will be a major original contribution. Also, there is a significant need for an efficient method to upgrade existing critical facilities that require structural and/or non-structural system protection. The development of ductile precast HPFRCC infill panels will result in an effective and practical method for enhancing the strength, stiffness and energy dissipation capabilities of deficient steel and RC frame structures, while allowing them to remain in full service during rehabilitation activities. Structural and materials engineering experts will collaborate on developing HPFRCC mixture designs that can be handled in a normal batch plant, trucked to the site and pumped to the casting location. Analytical models that accurately reproduce the behavior of HPFRCC under various stress states will be developed for simulation of structural behavior, for the control of the proposed pseudo-dynamic experiments, as well as for use by the earthquake engineering community in general. The combination of the computing power of the NEESgrid and MGRID, integrated with various structural simulation packages, offers a unique opportunity that will be pursued for the incorporation of highly detailed models in pseudo-dynamic testing of wall and frame systems.    Broader impacts: 1) One of the most significant broader impacts of this research will be the wider acceptance and use of highly damage-tolerant fiber reinforced concretes for enhancing structural performance during earthquakes. 2) The results of this research will provide the NEES community with the capability of using more sophisticated simulation models for hybrid testing of structural systems. 3) A multi-use environment based on the Sakai software platform (used in NEESgrid and course management systems across the country) will be further developed, where students and researchers will be able to do coursework and participate in experiments without negotiating separate tools, authenticating to different systems, or learning new interfaces. 4) A participatory experience for pre-engineering students at institutions affiliated with the Midwest Instructional Technology Center (MITC) will be created. Through the involvement of a diverse set of graduate and undergraduate researchers and outreach to students at small colleges, particularly women and under-represented minority students, a new generation of students  will be introduced to the use of high-performance structural materials, behavior of structures during earthquakes, and sophisticated structural analysis and simulation techniques.",James Wight|Sherif El-Tawil|Sarah Billington|Gustavo Parra-Montesinos

There is mounting evidence that liverworts (Phylum Marchantiophyta) were the first green plants to diversify on land some 500,000 million years ago and as such they are the oldest living lineage of terrestrial organisms.  This species-rich group of small green plants is remarkably diverse in structure, and includes extremely ancient relictual lineages as well as more recent radiations of closely related species. The antiquity of liverworts and the rich biodiversity at all taxonomic levels provide an unparalleled window into early land plant diversification. This collaborative effort brings together experts from around the world for a multidisciplinary, highly integrated approach that combines anatomical and developmental features with DNA sequence and genome structural characters to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire spectrum of liverwort diversity. Three general types of data will be compiled: 1) conservative morphological and genome characters to resolve deep ""backbone"" relationships, 2) anatomical/developmental data to resolve intermediate-depth lineages, and 3) morphological and DNA sequence characters to resolve relationships among a sample of 800 taxa representing all genera of liverworts.  A second major goal of the project is to integrate phylogenetic inferences and bionformatic efforts between this and other on-going NSF-supported projects, including several funded ATOL programs. These integrative activities include contributions to studies of genome structure and evolution across land plants, expansions of novel informatic tools to make methods, results, and implications widely accessible, and continued development of DNA sequence utilities that will benefit a broad range of scientists working on diverse organisms.          This project relies on the cooperation with and integration among research programs focused on resolving the green plant Tree Of Life. Integrative activities are substantive and consequential, and include expansions to phylogenetic databases and methodological/conceptual aspects of work toward resolving the Tree Of Life.  At least six post-doctoral associates and as many graduate students will be supported by the project, with substantial involvement of undergraduates as well. An effort to involve and retain individuals from underrepresented groups will be orchestrated through established federal programs that focus on such initiatives, including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the McNair Scholars Program. A solid mentoring infrastructure will be developed within each research team to provide support and professional experiences that ensure productivity and success of all participants. Outreach efforts include web presentations on the morphology and identification of liverworts for educators at all levels, development of web-based materials and a workshop targeting secondary school teachers, and increasing public awareness through weekend field excursions.",Yin-Long Qiu|

The principal investigator and his colleagues promote innovations consistent with PATH objectives, through a primary focus on Production (creating a paradigm shift for construction from site to factory), Building Enclosures (innovating a structural design concept using pre-manufactured stacked monocoque units) and Energy / Whole House Design (integrating low energy and sustainable technologies). They address the housing industry's inefficiencies and fragmentation, caused by the slow adoption of new housing technologies, by setting out a number of research objectives that promote a paradigm shift using automotive technology transfer methodologies in the design and procurement process for housing. Process based innovations will include technologies appropriate to industrial design by adopting Product Design Development Process Modeling associated with Life Cycle Analysis appropriate to industrial ecology to form the basis of restructuring the traditional supply chain process and supporting sustainability imperatives respectively. Alternative mass customization opportunities for manufactured housing systems and their interaction with production line activities will be explored, taking advantage of improved construction accuracy and sequences of assembly through multi-dimensional digital simulations using object oriented digital design. Component design innovation will include systems integrated thermally insulated panels that perform as combined wall and floor systems that will sustain passive energy exchange within the house enclosure. Energy systems will incorporate integrated performance based controls that will optimize on energy consumption. Their proposal for a new paradigm will require a step change in thinking by the industry and as such the project has identified a strategy for engaging with a broad range of industry partners. The project will be run as collaboration between university units, which build on a project prototype for a prefabricated and transportable house that is powered exclusively by solar energy.    Current housing manufacture exploits a short sighted, least common denominator market that maximizes profit at the expense of social and environmental quality. In contrast, the investigators seek to elevate the technological knowledge base in housing design towards a highly efficient design and manufacturing approach that uncompromisingly integrates environmental and social sustainability features. A technology transfer paradigm shift is proposed by the investigators that will transform traditional construction methods into a mass customized production process that will benefit society through improved property performance, which will directly impact national concerns about the environment, the state of the housing infrastructure and the improvement of low income housing communities. A new genre of affordable medium density buildings will be conceived that will be more adaptable, durable, and energy efficient as whole-life housing typologies. Their new paradigm for housing design and construction will initiate a social transformation from depressed low income groups towards a progressive home owner society that has more lifestyle choices, therefore encouraging the viability of mixed use developments which will serve as a model for creating socially sustainable communities. The project objectives are motivated by the potential to create opportunities to repopulate blighted urban city areas. Therefore the investigator and his team will be creating an initial focus on sites situated in the Detroit inner urban area, as a model for repopulating these denuded urban zones. Significantly, the principles of their proposal will be equally relevant to the re-densification of cities throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The project's pedagogical value will be diffused through student based design studios and research projects, set within this research framework across multi disciplinary boundaries, which form part of a social outreach program already in existence within the University.",Harry Giles|Steven Skerlos|Tom Buresh|Fernando Lara|Eric Dueweke

This trend can be expected to continue, as designers struggle to address challenges such as data overload, the need for increased expressive power of modern technologies, and support for time sharing and attention management in a variety of complex real-world domains.  To ensure the robustness of multimodal interface designs, it will be critical to consider recent findings from behavioral and neuro-physiological research, which suggest the existence of considerable crossmodal constraints on attention in the form of modality expectations, modality shifting, and spatial and temporal crossmodal links.  Despite their potential for leading to performance breakdowns in human-computer interaction with potentially catastrophic consequences, these constraints have received little attention in guidelines for, and the design of, multimodal interfaces.  In an effort to address this shortcoming, the PI's main goals in this project are: (a) to determine whether performance effects of crossmodal links in attention that were reported in laboratory research scale up to complex real-world domains; (b) to determine whether tactile and peripheral visual cues, which were not considered in most earlier research on multimodal information processing, but which are increasingly included in multimodal interface design, are affected by crossmodal constraints to the same extent as foveal visual and auditory system output; and (c) to establish the effectiveness of an adaptive approach to multimodal information presentation for exploiting the performance benefits, and eliminating the performance costs, of crossmodal interactions.  The particular application domain for this research will be Air Traffic Control (ATC), a complex data-rich environment where difficulties with processing multimodal information are contributing to workload bottlenecks, breakdowns in situation awareness, and operational errors.  The number of concurrent attentional demands in this domain continues to increase with the introduction of advanced automation technologies.  Faced with these challenges, air traffic managers at the Cleveland En-Route Traffic Control Center have indicated a strong interest in collaborating with the PI on this research.  They will conduct a contextual inquiry and focus groups with controllers, and allow controllers to participate in experiments, whose purpose is to inform the design and iterative refinement of a multimodal ATC interface that includes visual, auditory, and tactile cues, where parameters such as the timing, salience, and location of cues can be adjusted dynamically in an attempt to exploit the benefits and avoid the performance costs of crossmodal links in attention.  The investigation will take place in the first stage within the context of a medium-fidelity ATC simulation in the PI's laboratory, and will later move to the dynamic ATC simulation facility at Cleveland Center.    Broader Impacts:  The findings from this research will advance our knowledge and understanding of multimodal information processing and, more specifically, the nature and extent of crossmodal links between vision, audition, and touch.  The results will also inform the design of future multimodal displays for data-rich event-driven domains such as aviation, medicine, or process control, and thus promote the safety of operations in these workplaces and benefit society through the transfer and application of basic research to applied system design.",Nadine Sarter|

At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration system.    This project will develop, deploy and assess  social networking tools to enhance collaboration among members of TSEEN using the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure. The proposed project brings together researchers in information science, social science, and public health who have established strong collaborations with government partners on the development of networks to support transdisciplinary research in public health. The researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.    Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks, where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as visual-analytic tools), or keywords/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes. Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii) different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii) different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500) one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.    Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among large  communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance  Epidemiology Evaluation Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed research. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to the design and deployment of social network referral tools to support collaboration among other digital government efforts within public health and beyond. Further, the government and non-government partners in this project  are exceptionally well-equipped to incorporate into their regularly scheduled education, training, and outreach workshops the skill sets of collaborative fluency afforded by the judicious use of network referral systems. Finally, by definition, social network referral systems have the potential to increase the likelihood of drawing in more diverse constituents within the public health community (in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, seniority, disciplinary perspectives) than heretofore possible. This extended network will also offer opportunities for mentoring of previously disadvantaged members within these communities.",Thomas Finholt|

This combined methodology, called Patent Cartography, will leverage multiple taxonomies, related terms, network analytics, visualization, and user interaction to navigate, explore, and map the patent space.     As the rate of patenting has increased, so too has the problem of patent thickets, or dense webs of overlapping intellectual property rights that an organization must hack its way through in order to commercialize new technology. In certain industries characterized by cumulative innovations and multiple blocking patents, the existence of such densely concentrated patent rights can have the perverse effect of stifling innovation rather than encouraging it. A recent Federal Trade Commission report notes that in certain industries, the large number of issued patents makes it virtually impossible to search all the potentially relevant patents, review the claims contained in each of those patents, and evaluate the infringement risk or the need for a license. For many firms the only practical response to this problem of unintentional and sometimes unavoidable patent infringement is to file hundreds of patents each year so as to have something to trade during cross-licensing negotiations. In other words, the only rational response to the large number of patents in a given field may be to contribute to it.     Given that 200,000 US patents are issued each year, with new patents issuing each week, any attempt to analyze and comprehend the dynamic topology and interconnectedness of patent space will almost certainly have to be based on information technology. The process of patent search, however, has not progressed very much even with the advent of searchable patent databases. Although automated, the patent search process itself has not been reengineered and thus remains functionally similar to the patent search process developed in the nineteenth century.     While end-users do not have the necessary tools to conduct exhaustive patent searches, professional patent searchers are overwhelmed with an ever increasing workload driven by an increased awareness of the importance of intellectual property. The need for effective end-user patent search capabilities will only increase over time, yet the traditional search process must be reengineered for that need to be met.     Using sets of existing professionally-generated patent searches, this project will compare end-user searches conducted with existing tools with other searches conducted with the new methodologies. Several different classes of end-users have been identified, with different levels of previous knowledge and experience with the patent system, and this project will compare the search results produced by each class of user with the professional patent search results. At the conclusion of the study, we will have not only a better understanding of the applicability of Patent Cartography and visualization techniques to the process of patent search, but also an understanding of the impact of familiarity and experience with the patent system in harnessing the potential of Patent Cartography.     This project will expand the boundaries of document retrieval beyond simple keyword and category search into multidimensional analysis combining mixed initiative data and text mining with visualizations. The project will also combine content and network analysis and evaluate visualizations based on both proximity and dependency data. Search processes and search strategies will also be examined in the context of large document collections. The project will also develop models of task-based information searching, which has been generally under-explored. Finally, the project will develop an ethnographic account of the patent search process by observing patent search experts.     This project will extend the scope of research on searching, analyzing, and visualizing large document collections. Patents are one exemplary form of large digital library repositories that contain both structured and unstructured data to which these techniques can be applied. Other sources include Medline, Research Abstracts, repositories of the World Wide Web, and other enterprise repositories. This search process could be leveraged in health care, life sciences, pharmaceuticals, market research, competitive intelligence, knowledge discovery, and tracking technology maturity and innovation to name just a few.",Gavin Clarkson|Suresh Bhavnani|Michael McQuaid|Jeffrey Kreulen|Stephen Boyer

The mission of the American National Election  Studies (ANES) is to inform explanations of election outcomes by providing data that support rich  hypothesis testing, maximize methodological excellence, measure many variables, and promote  comparisons across people, contexts, and time. The ANES serves this mission by providing researchers with a view of the political world through the eyes of ordinary citizens. Such data are critical, because these citizens' actions determine election outcomes.     This research  continues the ANES mission for the next four years, but in new and better ways  than ever before. It builds on an ANES history that has made the project a valuable resource to  generations of social scientists. As has been true for every past presidential election in the ANES time  series, a presidential year pre- and post-election study will be conducted using face-to-face interviewing of a nationally representative sample of adults, with an unusually high response rate. This study will include questions specific to the election of 2008 and also questions that augment the ANES time series, which is now in its sixth decade. For the first time, moreover, scholars will be able to purchase interview minutes and additional cases on the time series study to enhance its breadth.    In many other respects, this proposal constitutes a substantial break from the past, outlining new kinds of data collection, new methods for choosing questionnaire items, a new management structure, new organizational procedures to promote the involvement of a broader set of scholars, and a fundamentally different kind of relationship between the ANES and its user community.  One new data collection effort will be a two-year panel study involving six core waves of data  collection with the same respondents, plus 15 additional waves of data collection. The first core wave will be in late 2007, before the primaries; the next three core waves will be spread over the months running up to election day; and the final core waves will be in November and May after the election. Data will also be collected during every other month throughout the life of the panel, but with a focus on matters that are not explicitly political, to minimize selective panel attrition or conditioning driven by interest in politics while producing lots of valuable information on respondents. The panel will allow scholars to study citizen politics in new ways and will illuminate how election year politics affect judgments of the new administration in the formative months of its term.    A second new data collection enterprise involves a partnership with the Ohio State University Center  for Human Resource Research. They conduct the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which has been interviewing a nationally representative panel of adults and their children for decades with breathtakingly long and varied questionnaires. Questions measuring political attitudes and behaviors will be included in these surveys for the first time, allowing the study of developmental and socialization experiences through the life-cycle and across generations.    To help scholars develop and validate new measurement tools for use in the above-listed surveys, an  ANES pilot study will be run in November, 2006, reinterviewing respondents from the 2004 ANES.  The components of this data collection plan each strengthen the others. Alone, each component will  allow a broad range of scholars to evaluate the robustness of old and new theoretical claims. In addition, each endeavor will be designed to facilitate coordinated analysis with all the other data collections. The specifics of the designs of all these studies will be determined by an array of scholars more intellectually diverse than ever before. Its new PIs and Board of Overseers hail from more universities and a broader range of disciplines than any of its predecessors.     This research project includes a new Internet-based procedure for soliciting, processing, reviewing, and providing feedback on proposals for study design elements from anyone who wishes to offer them. All this will be done with an unprecedented transparency to the user community. Because these activities will generate a huge amount of data, detailed plans have been designed outlining how the management of the study design, data collection, and data dissemination processes will be carried out by the experienced technical staff that is already in place. In addition to coordinating the questionnaire design and fieldwork processes, the staff will maintain and update the study's huge and multifaceted website by adding the newly collected data and also dramatically enhancing the study's electronic archives of previously-collected information dating back from the 1940s.    Broader Impacts:  By generating large, multifaceted datasets of high quality, the ANES will equip researchers to learn new and important lessons about the world of politics. These data will be distributed widely and quickly to serve thousands of scholars and to be used in classrooms around the world to enrich research and education. Americans want to understand how its democracy works. The ANES will help to inform the nation about itself, exploring the causes and consequences of voting behavior and electoral outcomes. With such knowledge, the polity will be better equipped to nurture and refine its system of government.",Arthur Lupia|

Different from conventional assessments of mathematical  knowledge (e.g., the SAT or Woodcock-Johnson assessment), these measures investigate the special  mathematical knowledge teachers use to work in classrooms with students. For instance, these measures  assess not only whether teachers know that 1 3/4  1/2 = 3 1/2, but also whether they can explain what  this equation means, can construct a concrete representation or word problem which corresponds to it, and  can understand and generalize from an unusual solution method for this problem. This proposal responds  to a number of challenges that have arisen while disseminating these measures to researchers.    Currently, the Learning Mathematics for Teaching project (LMT) disseminates pre-piloted forms and  technical information for evaluating teacher learning in K-8 number and operations, pre-algebra and  algebra, and geometry. Teacher learning opportunities, however, frequently focus on more narrowly  defined topic areas  for instance, rational number concepts and operations. Yet items capturing teacher  knowledge of rational number compose only one component of LMT's number concepts and operations  measures. Because these current measures include other topics, they are unlikely to be appropriately  sensitive to the content and effects of such professional development.    In response, this proposal argues for the construction of evaluation modules designed to be sensitive to  and allow research and evaluation in the following areas: rational numbers; proportional reasoning;  geometry; data analysis and probability. In all but the last topic area, for which LMT will create an  entirely new set of items, the project will review and supplement existing items, create a form composed  of items that capture key teacher competencies in these areas, pilot this form, then compose technical  materials that support these modules' use. These technical materials will include two parallel forms and  pre-equated raw-score-to-standardized-score conversion tables, to facilitate straightforward scoring.    This proposal also describes plans to improve the quality of dissemination training by exploring the  nature of problems that arise when outside evaluators use these measures, and describes work to improve  measures of teachers' knowledge of student learning around content.  Intellectual Merit    This proposal grows from a well-established measures development project. At every step in this project's  history, the provision of high-quality measures has coincided with  and in some ways, depended upon   progress in building theory about content knowledge for teaching mathematics, and exploring new areas  in measurement design and scaling. This will be the case in the work proposed here, as well.    Broader Impact    This proposal enhances the infrastructure for research on teacher learning. These measures can be used to  evaluate teachers' learning in pre-service teacher education programs; to make comparisons between  preparation in traditional teacher education programs and alternative routes to certification; to judge the  efficacy of professional development aimed at improving teachers' content knowledge for teaching; and  to estimate the effects of curriculum materials designed to improve teachers' knowledge of mathematics  and students. These measures are accessible to users with limited technical expertise, comparable across  programs and approaches to professional development, and of high technical quality.",Geoffrey Phelps|Deborah Ball|Stephen Schilling

Heat capacity is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that until recently has been impossible to measure at low temperatures on small volumes of synthetic material.  Synthesis of the desired mineral phases will be conducted in a multi-anvil apparatus and low-temperature heat capacity measurements will be conducted with a Physical Properties Measurement System.  Heat capacity measurements will be carried out on several mantle phases, including high-pressure polymorphs of olivine and feldspar.  These measurements will allow generation of the Gibbs free energies of these and associated phases from the extant enthalpy measurements and/or experimental phase equilibria.  Results of this study are expected to shed light on the stability of assemblages in the mantle and will allow calculation of new phase diagrams for high-pressure rocks that are metamorphosed during subduction and continental collision.  A deeper understanding of the increasing number of rocks known to have reached ultrahigh pressures and returned to the surface during mountain-building events or explosive volcanic action requires the evaluation of new reactions, to which this study will contribute materially.      This work contributes to a broader understanding of fundamental tectonic processes in the deep Earth.  Previous studies of mantle assemblages have been based on many simplifications, including relatively simple compositions.  Systems of expanded composition more closely represent the real mantle and the volcanic rocks that are generated there.  Future study of such complex systems is dependent on a thorough knowledge of the thermodynamics and phase equilibria of important mantle minerals including those explored in this proposal.  The phase equilibria provide important constraints on the structure and dynamics of the mantle, which is the source for the great majority of volcanic rocks and for many major earthquakes.",Eric Essene|

Many of these elements are of environmental concern and Au and Ag are economically important. Better understanding of the factors that control the substitution of these trace elements into arsenian pyrite is needed if we are to understand the processes that release elements into the environment and trap them in ore deposits. The project to be undertaken will clarify these factors by observation of the nanoscale mineralogy and geochemistry of material from a wide range of geologic environments. Previous work by the group has shown that the limit of solid solution for Au in arsenian pyrite from Carlin-type Au deposits is defined by a linear equation linking the concentrations of gold and arsenic. In the new project, the team will test whether arsenian pyrite in other types of ore deposits (epithermal, mesothermal, skarn, porphyry copper) also hosts Au and has similar As-Au solid-solution relations. They will also test whether other trace elements show similar solubility limits in arsenian pyrite and whether these elements occupy nanodomains when their concentrations exceed the solubility limit. Finally, they will test if compositional zones in arsenian pyrites are formed both by growth of crystal layers and by diffusion of adsorbed trace elements, whether true growth zones can be correlated from sample to sample, and whether they can be used to trace fluid pathways through individual deposits.  Nanoscale observations will be carried out by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), which is a Z-contrast imaging technique at the near-atomic scale.

To improve space weather prediction, this project combines a physics-based model of the ionosphere and thermosphere with targeted measurements, a process known as targeted data assimilation. The proposed research includes extensions of data assimilation algorithms to address nonlinear dynamics, model error, and computational complexity. Dynamically steered experiments involving the Millstone Observatory and EISCAT incoherent scatter radars will demonstrate the ability of targeted data assimilation to improve the quality and value of measurements for space weather prediction. The proposed research is relevant to NOAA. The project's  goal is to improve space weather prediction in the ionosphere and thermosphere. The ability to predict the effects of solar storms is needed to protect humans and technological systems. Humans in manned spaced flight, as well as in commercial aircraft, are affected by solar storms, and total radiation dosages are a growing concern. Technological systems are also affected. For example, magnetic field fluctuations induce currents in electric power lines, which can damage components of the power grid causing blackouts and substantial economic losses. The accuracy of GPS,widely used for military and commercial operations, is commonly degraded by these events. The proposed research will greatly benefit the incoherent scatter radar (ISR) community. Since ISRs require high power, they are extremely expensive to run, and thus every radar experiment must be chosen for maximal efficiency. This efficiency is difficult to achieve in practice, however, since radars work in different modes and scan different parts of the ionosphere. This project will improve ISR efficiency by allowing operators to observe what may be happening if the radar mode or look direction were changed. This methodology will fundamentally change the way radars are run, since operators will be able to make informed decisions on what science they can accomplish by changing modes. When an experiment is not yielding useful results, operators will be able examine model results that simulate alternative radar modes, and thus dynamically switch experiments. This ability will dramatically improve the efficiency of the radars.",Dennis Bernstein|Aaron Ridley

This system would lay a foundation for highly optimized implementations of fundamental signal and imaging processing computations that arise in many science and engineering problems, including image recognition, communications analysis, speech processing, querying, indexing, and retrieval from multimedia databases, and image segmentation of aerial, satellite, and astronomical images. The proposed multidisciplinary approach optimizes from algorithm specification, to mathematical representation, to software and hardware (FPGA) implementation, based on properties of data and unique requirements of   the environment and the target hardware device.   The novelty of the system is twofold: (1) it performs joint optimization  across mathematical, software and hardware (system-on-a-chip FPGA) domains; and, (2) it is a dynamic, data-driven system in that signal-processing transforms are tailored to algorithm requirements and input signals, for reduced distortion and increased compression, and the system can be queried and steered during execution. Implementations are based on the best mathematical formulation of the problem coupled with automated selection of the best implementation among a space of alternatives, through the integration of models relating mathematical properties to implementation  behavior. Both hardware and software optimization are treated in a unified way. It is anticipated that with these methods the design-time will be decreased by two orders of magnitude or more, compared to implementations derived in a traditional way. Because the proposed system can explore a broad range of implementations that exceed the capabilities of a human designer, the implementations derived by the approach pursued in the project may even exhibit lower resource costs and higher performance.

Silicon defects are a pressing problem for hardware parts, mainly because of the shrinking of transistors sizes down to a few tens of nanometers. The proposal attacks this goal from a few angles: first it develops a framework for the analysis of the impact and exposure risks associated with a range of silicon failures. In this context, the types of failures analyzed are:  1) soft-errors, that is, transient faults due to energy particles present in the atmosphere, which are estimated to be relevant for silicon technologies in the next few years;  2) manufacturing defects due to the imprecision of  manufacturing small scale transistor parts; and 3) wear-out failures, due to  the weakening of transistors as they approach nanometer sizes. The second goal of the proposal develops software to support the analysis and evaluation of a range of potential future scenarios, which include these types of failures.

It emphasizes the flexibility attained   when sources of production (e.g., workers, machines, plants, etc.) are   multi-functional. Examples of this include workers with multiple skills,   machines with flexible or reconfigurable capabilities, and supply chains   with flexible sourcing and distribution options. By having multi-functional   servers (sources), capacity can be dynamically allocated in response to the   realization of uncertain demand. Taking queueing networks as models of the   production systems, approximate deterministic metrics of flexibility are   used to accurately predict the best design from various alternatives.   Mathematical programming, queueing theory, Markov Decision Processes, and   discrete event systems simulation are employed. The research illuminates   the connections between general queueing networks with flexible servers and   the properties found in approximate, deterministic network models.    If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in   the design of service and manufacturing operations and supply chains that   deliver high-performance efficiencies and service levels despite uncertain   changes in technology, heightened consumer expectations, decreased vertical   integration of the supply chain, and intensified global competition.

For example: is the evolution of HIV virulence related   to rates of transmission among hosts? Which environmental factors most   strongly influence the rate of evolution, and what are the strengths   and directions of evolution? This broad class of questions all involve   adaptive evolution (i.e., the direction and strength of natural   selection). All existing methods share the significant shortcoming in   using a completely neutral model of evolution. That is, previous   methods fail to account for natural selection, despite the fact that it   is the central feature of interest. The method developed here is the   most comprehensive to date. It simultaneously accounts for random   evolutionary fluctuations (such as genetic drift), common ancestry, and   natural selection (under multiple adaptive regimes). Methods are   provided for formulating scientific hypotheses as explicit mathematical   models, each of which can then be fit to the data. Modern   model-selection theory is then to identify the best-support model or   models. Because in this approach, the causal factors of interest are   explicitly modeled and tested directly against data, scientists will be   able to use these methods to identify which aspects of the evolutionary   process are most important, describe the relative strengths and   directions of these evolutionary forces, and understand how they have   influenced the tempo and mode of evolution.    The comparative method is a fundamental tool in organismal,   evolutionary and ecological biology. It is used to identify and study   the factors which have been important in producing the diversity of   life we see today. Understanding the significant environmental,   functional, and genetic mechanisms operative in the past is critical   for planning conservation strategies for the future. It is also   important in planning effective strategies to control human disease.   For example, two fronts in the battle against HIV, predicting the   spread of drug-resistance and immune-escape mutations, rely on an   understanding of how HIV evolves in response to natural selection and   how HIV evolution differs within and among hosts. Beyond the   environmental sciences, it is now widely appreciated that studies of   function (at the organismal, biochemical, or gene level) require the   application of the comparative method.The funded research will provide   practical tools to enable comparative biologists to make stronger tests   of their hypotheses.",Aaron King|

The aim of the proposed project is to develop analysis and simulation tools to characterize the three-dimensional electrode microstructure and to understand microstructural evolution and the resulting electrochemical performance.      TECHNICAL DETAILS: A main aim of this research is to fully understand the relationships between electrode processing, structure, properties, and performance.  This will ultimately allow design of higher performance and more stable electrode microstructures, as well as providing processing information needed to achieve these structures.  The new methods and understanding will be included in new university course materials and in educational modules designed to reach a broad spectrum of age groups.

Organelle DB houses data for 25,000 proteins from 154 organisms spanning the eukaryotic kingdom. Each protein in Organelle DB is presented with its subcellular localization, protein sequence and, as available, a detailed description of its function (as culled from corresponding model organism databases). To facilitate data interoperability, all protein localizations are annotated using controlled vocabulary from the Gene Ontology consortium. Organelle DB is also a significant repository of biological images, providing roughly 1500 micrographs of yeast cells carrying stained proteins. Organelle DB is freely accessible at organelledb.lsi.umich.edu. At present, Organelle DB is a cross-species and cross-discipline resource consolidating our knowledge of the proteins comprising eukaryotic organelles and subcellular structures; however, it holds the potential to be much more. Organelle DB can serve as a channel through which we can provide an integrated knowledge base of orthologous data sets related to protein localization, while fostering the use of standardized data formats and the development of graphical interfaces for the visualization of biological data in non-text-based formats. In this award Organelle DB will be integrated with relevant external databases. Orthologous data sets from protein-protein interaction studies will be integrated with protein localization data in Organelle DB through links to and from the BIND database. Images of eukaryotic proteins visualized by live cell fluorescence microscopy will be incorporated into Organelle DB using the standardized data structure of the Open Microscopy Environment (OME). Organelle View, a prototype interface for the visualization of localization data in a non text-based format, will be made accessible through Organelle DB.

Recent studies suggest that the availability and bioactivity of IGFs are regulated by several specific, high-affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBPs belong to a conserved gene family of proteins that bind to IGFs in extracellular environments. Since the binding affinities of IGFBPs for IGFs are equal to or even greater than those of the IGF receptors, they can control the amount of IGFs presented to their cell surface receptors and may play key roles in determining the biological activities of the IGF signaling pathway. There is also in vitro evidence that some IGFBPs have intrinsic biological activities that are IGF-independent. This project is designed to test the hypothesis that different members of the IGFBP family are expressed in spatially and temporally restricted fashions and they each play distinct roles in regulating tissue growth and differentiation through IGF-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The current project has 3 aims. In the first aim, the mechanistic basis of IGFBP-3 action in regulating head skeleton and inner ear growth and differentiation will be investigated with special focus on the role of ligand binding and nuclear targeting. For this, native and mutant IGFBP-3 will be expressed in IGFBP-3 knocked down embryos for in vivo mechanistic studies. Aim 2 seeks to determine the structure of zebrafish IGFBP-4, map its spatial and temporal expression pattern, and investigate its physiological functions in vivo. In Aim 3, the mode of IGFBP-4 action and the possible role of proteolysis in controlling local IGFBP-4 action will be studied in vitro and in vivo. Aim 4 seeks to determine zebrafish IGFBP-6 structure, developmental expression, physiological functions in vivo, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its actions. The completion of the proposed studies will provide novel and important insights into the functions of IGFBPs and the mechanistic basis underlying their biological actions. For the first time, the functional significance of ligand-independent actions, nuclear localization, and proteolysis of an IGFBP will be examined in vivo. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms of growth regulation in fish will undoubtedly contribute to vertebrate growth physiology in general. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of growth regulation in zebrafish should help to understand human growth physiology and may have applications in aquaculture for efficient production of animal protein as well. This research project is also of importance for understanding the structural and functional evolution of the IGFBP gene family and will expand research infrastructure in Michigan and increase research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.",Cunming Duan|

Oxide supports (TiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3, SiO2) play a crucial role in the activity and selectivity of supported Au nano-catalysts. This project will employ a hybrid theoretical/experimental approach combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and well-defined surface science experiments to address the issue of chemical activity at metal/oxide interfaces.  The elementary chemical transformations of diatomic adsorbates (O2 and H2) will be addressed, as well as the underlying physical factors governing the enhanced catalytic activity at the interface of Au and reducible or irreducible oxides. The insights obtained in this project will present an excellent starting point in the development of a predictive theory of metal/oxide interface chemistry, which is of interest in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis, microelectronics, and chemical sensors.     The broader impacts of this CAREER project will be highly relevant to current technology since the chemistry of H2 and O2 over Au/oxide catalysts is important for low-T propylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and PROX (preferential CO oxidation). The utility of the combined use of experiment and theory to tackle complex issues in heterogeneous catalysis and materials science will also be exploited in the educational and outreach activities. The central educational objective will be to promote a molecular approach to science and technology with an emphasis on interdisciplinary learning. The educational objectives will be accomplished via: (1) multiple outreach activities (2) new course development, and (3) educational module development. The outreach activities will introduce cutting edge science and technology to local minority elementary, high school, and college students.  A new course will integrate state-of-the-art electronic structure calculation methods into the engineering curriculum.

The approach is to extend a relational database engine with sophisticated and powerful methods for querying on sequences. Extending a relational database engine, rather than build a stand-alone sequence query processing tool, is a much more challenging task, but is essential as it allows the end-user to combine the power of analytical facilities already provided by SQL engines with the added ability to query sequences. A crucial aspect of this approach is to have a clean query algebra that provides a powerful set of biological sequence querying features, and can be accommodated within the framework of an extended relational model. SEQ will be implemented by extending the existing Postgres database engine. The collaboration between the investigators (computer scientists and biomedical researchers) will also facilitate actual deployment of the SEQ system in a project that will analyze various genomes for transcriptional regulatory elements related to genes essential for eye development and visual function. The key intellectual contribution of this proposal is in the development of a declarative querying tool for managing biological sequence data sets in a relational framework. This effort naturally requires designing and implementing methods that span most of the layers of a relational database engine, including query algebra, query language, query processing algorithms, data storage methods, and query optimization methods. The SEQ project will lead to new computer science methods for sequence query processing in each of these database management aspects. A current preliminary prototype clearly demonstrates the tremendous functionality and performance benefits of these aspects in the SEQ approach. In addition to the contributions that SEQ will make to computer science research, the project will also directly assist in the analysis of downstream targets for a transcription factor critical for rod photoreceptor development and function. The broader impacts of this proposal are in enabling life scientists to query and manage sequence data using declarative and efficient querying methods, and to enable the processing of complex sequence queries with traditional relational querying. The project will result in a free open-source OSI-certified release of the SEQ system using the ECL license. This release will allow the entire life sciences community to leverage these powerful querying methods. We note that a number of model organism databases are starting to use relational databases (often Postgres) for managing sequence data; as an example see the Chado schema used by GMOD. Sequence analysis tools are very applicable to this broader range of users as the system will essentially add complex sequence querying functionality (with efficient performance) to Postgres. The broader impacts of this proposal include enhancing the nascent bioinformatics curriculum at the University of Michigan. The project will result in cross-training computer science PhD students in life sciences research, and include the training of at least one women PhD. This project will allow undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral staff, and faculty in the EECS department and the Kellogg's Eye Center at the University of Michigan to foster a close interaction in the methods that span the disciplines of computer science and genetics.",Jignesh Patel|Anand Swaroop|Atsuhiro Kanda

Previous molecular studies have shown that the family is descended from a single ancestor in the New World, where the distinctive morphology of the flowers is related to their pollination by oil-collecting bees. Those bees did not accompany the plant species that migrated to the Old World, where the floral morphology is more diverse. The three specialists collaborating in this research combine training and experience in both traditional systematics and modern molecular and analytical techniques, and many years of work in the systematics and evolution of the Malpighiaceae. They plan a set of four interlocking projects: 1) additional molecular sequencing to resolve the worst remaining problems in the family's phylogenetic tree; 2) use of DNA sequences, fossil evidence, continental history, and present geographical distributions to address the question of the path(s) followed by the ancestors of those seven paleotropical groups in their migration from the New World to the Old World; 3) application of morphological studies of disparity to paleotropical species and their neotropical relatives to evaluate hypotheses on the evolution of floral morphology; and 4) a revision of the generic taxonomy of the family and the placement of the resulting classification on a website, with phylogenetic trees, interactive keys, nomenclature, descriptions, illustrations, photographs, and distribution maps.    This study will bridge the gap between molecular studies and traditional morphological techniques. The resulting synthesis among investigators will be a paradigm for a new approach to systematics that will serve the needs of all those around the world who rely on systematists for the best, most modern classifications of tropical organisms: conservationists, ecologists, foresters, and laypeople. The website will provide a way to convey all the results of this work in a timely manner, and will allow for constant updating and amplification of the information provided. The studies of the relationships between New World and Old World species, and their migration routes, will be of great interest to biologists grappling with similar problems in other groups of plants and animals. Studies of morphological disparity will allow biologists to understand better how morphological stasis is maintained in the tree of life.

Recently documented short-lived (1 to 4 m.y.) episodes  of glaciation appear to coincide with large magnitude shifts in atmospheric pCO2, marine and continental  temperatures and relative sea-level suggesting a CO2-climate-glaciation link. This link, however, remains  untested. We propose an interdisciplinary study focused on significantly improving our understanding of  the evolution of the late Paleozoic climate system, and the mechanisms that triggered climate change  during the Earth's last period of transition from icehouse to greenhouse states. The research is designed to  test two hypotheses: (1) that atmospheric CO2 variability was the primary driver for repeated growth and  retreat of continental ice sheets, and, in turn, (2) that late Paleozoic ice sheets strongly influenced global  climate, particularly in the tropics. Specific basins in central and eastern Europe and western Argentina  have been targeted given their stratigraphic and paleogeographic coverage, presence of marine, paralic  and paleosol-bearing terrestrial deposits, and their existing biostratigraphy and potential for further  radiometric dating (i.e., multiple intercalated volcanic tuffs) and biostratigraphic analysis. This research  has three major objectives:  * To establish a radiometrically calibrated, chronostratigraphic framework (Gzhelian to early Middle  Permian) through the integration of new and existing bio-, cyclo-, and chemo-stratigraphic (87Sr/86Sr)  data with U/Pb dating of volcanic tuffs, and the application of these integrated data to multiple  quantitative tools (CONOP, RASC, CASP, GraphCor).  * To further develop and calibrate high-resolution, quantitative proxy records of paleo-atmospheric  pCO2, paleo-precipitation, and marine and terrestrial paleo-temperatures. This includes critical  evaluation and further development of new quantitative proxies as well as direct comparison of proxy  records to sedimentologic evidence for glaciations and 'warmings' in southern Gondwanan  successions.  * Development of a theoretical climate framework for the late Paleozoic glacial-interglacial oscillations  using three-dimensional climate models to quantify the sensitivity of ice sheets on Gondwana to  pCO2, determine the role of ice sheets in driving global climate change, and make climate predictions  that can be tested through comparison with the proxy records.  Broader Impacts: The proposed research will offer four major contributions to the broader scientific  community: (1) a reconstruction of the late Paleozoic climate system at an unprecedented level of  resolution and accuracy, (2) an important test of the pCO2-climate paradigm for climate evolution through  Earth history, (3) documentation of marine-terrestrial climate linkages at unprecedented temporal  resolution for the Paleozoic, and (4) the first test of proposed correlations of cyclothemic successions in  eastern Euramerican and North American basins, and of linkages to the Gondwanan glaciosedimentary  record. In addition, to the planned cross-disciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students, the  PIs will integrate their research efforts into three educational outreach programs designed to enhance the  research and teaching opportunities of underrepresented undergraduate students and high school science  teachers. We will make our data and model simulations available to the greater scientific community by  importing them into the CHRONOS System (and its partner website, PaleoStrat), a web-based interactive  resource with which PI Davydov is directly involved.",Christopher Poulsen|

Our first line of research proposes that detrital apatite (U-Th)/He cooling ages can act as sediment tracers, and thus be used to test whether a suite of steep catchments, in order of increasing size and complexity, are eroding uniformly or are dominated by point source erosion processes. Our second line of research compares the distribution of cooling ages from modern river sediments with those from older deposits, specifically river sediments preserved in caves, to investigate temporal changes in relief and catchment hypsometry. We use a 3D thermal model to account for the influence of the topographic bending of isotherms on interpreted detrital grain-age distributions from sediment.  In addition, we propose to use cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations in river and cave sediments to investigate spatial and temporal changes in catchment-average erosion rates. Detrital apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry and cosmogenic nuclides are easily integrated tools because they utilize different minerals from the same bag of river sand.  By developing and integrating these tools in detrital settings, and by exploiting a wealth of previous (U-Th)/He data and a set of well-dated caves, we investigate the topographic evolution of the southern Sierra Nevada, California, from the earliest Pliocene to today. Our integrated thermochronometric and cosmogenic approach is readily applied to other settings. For example, our development of the detrital apatite (U-Th)/He approach will determine the suitability of this technique for older deposits (e.g., sedimentary basins) for quantifying paleorelief and paleoerosion rates in orogenic belts around the world.    Broader Significance:  This project addresses fundamental problems in evolution of the Earth's surface in a mountain range of keen interest to geologists and laypersons alike.  Our research should help answer how steep mountain valleys in the Sierra Nevada erode, the rates at which they erode and produce sediment, and how the distribution of elevation within valleys has evolved in light of climate change (e.g. repeated glaciations) over the last 2 million years.  Furthermore, the geochemical tools we will develop should prove valuable in the overall effort of quantifying topography and erosion rate changes in mountain belts over longer timescales (>2 million years).   	Broader significance to the scientific community include development of a new application of a geochemical tool (apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry) and integration of this technique with other more conventional geochemical tools (e.g. cosmogenic isotopes).  Career development and training associated with this project includes training and preparation of a postdoctoral scientist for a career in academia.   The study will also facilitate at least one undergraduate student completing a senior thesis associated with this project. Public outreach and K-12 education will occur in the form of (1) education of National Park Service interpreters at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks charged with teaching park visitors about the geology and landscapes of the southern Sierra Nevada, and (2) involvement of an elementary school teacher to development an awareness of current research topics in the Earth sciences as well as new lesson plans and course materials.",Todd Ehlers|Greg Stock

In addition, the presence of a terrestrial helium-heat imbalance was suggested based on the observed low mantle He/heat flux ratio at the proximity of mid-ocean ridges. Recent work, however, indicates that the driving transport mechanisms for these two tracers are of a fundamentally different nature for a high range of rock permeabilities in the crust. It was concluded that low He/heat flux ratios in a steady-state regime do not reflect a He deficit in the crust or mantle original reservoirs, but rather, the combined impact of air saturated water, advection, conduction, and diffusion. Together with other noble gas measurements and determined noble gas temperatures (NGTs), part I of the proposed work will take advantage of these recent findings to test and develop the newly created He/heat flux tracer to identify the occurrence, both in time and space, of tectonothermal events in continental regions, and in the Michigan Basin in particular. Part II will take advantage of common tools in order to address questions in relation to NGT determination in ice-covered regions. The latter is a direct measure of the temperature at which groundwater equilibrated with the atmosphere during infiltration and offer a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of past climate in continental areas as well as to assess the impact of glaciation on groundwater recharge in mid-high latitude regions.  In addition to illustrating how He/heat flux ratios can be used in conjunction with NGTs to investigate the tectonothermal history of continental regions, this work will also contribute to an improved understanding of NGT determination in ice-covered regions. This work will impact knowledge in the fields of Mantle Geochemistry, Geophysics, Structural Geology, Hydrology and Paleoclimatology.

This project will clarify aspects of mammoth biology, the cause of mammoth extinction, and the nature of environmental change during the transition from the Ice Age to climates more typical of today's conditions. The new data that permit these advances come from mammoth tusks, the enlarged incisor teeth typical of all elephant-relatives and frequently recovered from the Arctic permafrost. Mammoth tusks formed through a life-long process of adding cone-shaped layers to the tusk base. This process was modulated by, and thus recorded, complex interactions involving climate, food resources, behavior, and reproductive history. By drilling cores of material from multiple positions along tusks and analyzing the structure and composition of the layers in these cores, we will assemble records of diet, climate, health status, migratory movements, and reproductive history. This yields a detailed picture of how mammoths responded to environmental conditions during their lifetimes, what changes were associated with their dramatic reduction in range, near the end of the Ice Age, and what changes preceded their final extinction. This project will involve fieldwork by University of Michigan and University of Minnesota Co-PIs and graduate students, along with Russian and European collaborators, in north-central Siberia, northeast Siberia, and Wrangel Island. We will collect new specimens, sample specimens in existing collections, and return samples for analysis at our home institutions. Analytical procedures will include (a) radiocarbon dating, to place each specimen in a temporal as well as a spatial context, (b) documentation of growth lines, to lay out the basic framework of life history, (c) oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen isotope analyses, to assess aspects of diet, climate, and physiology, and (d) strontium-isotope analyses to evaluate patterns of migratory movement. Mammoth tusks are a rich archive of natural history and environmental data, and this project coordinates a broad array of approaches for distilling this information and applying it to research questions in multiple fields. Collaborative aspects of this project support international cooperation in Europe and Asia, and the dramatic character of mammoths and mammoth tusks makes this work engaging for non-specialist audiences, in addition to the paleontologists, ecologists, archaeologists and climate modelers interested in the data.",Daniel Fisher|

Markets, which emerge as actors forge relationships and stake out positions that shape their future opportunities and outcomes, are social environments that define and coordinate economic action.  Within the USKE, different industrial markets arise as organizations seek novel information that will enable technological innovation through their networks while striving for the recognition of investors and analysts.    This project will demonstrate the important relationship between inter-organizational networks and institutional fields in three related analyses that seek to explain: (1) inter-industry variations in the effect organizational networks and identities exert on financial and innovative outcomes; (2) the behavioral sources of those distinct industrial markets; and (3) the appearance and effects of radical innovations that sometimes emerge when different industrial orders collide.

To contribute to this understanding, Binding MOAD (Mother of All Databases) will be mined to probe the biophysics of molecular recognition.  Binding MOAD is the largest possible collection of high-quality, protein-ligand complexes available from the Protein Databank (8200+ structures).  Areas that will be addressed include the maximum affinity of ligand binding, the degree of burial and packing within a binding site, the role of bridging water molecules, and the contributions of protein flexibility/induced-fit.  The impact of these studies is unique because the dataset is unique.  Binding affinity data has been obtained for ~2200 structures, an order of magnitude more than other binding datasets.  The affinity data in Binding MOAD adds a layer of depth to these studies that has been unavailable until this research.  Though many have mined subsets of the Protein Databank for various patterns, it has not been possible to relate these patterns to affinity.  Now, for the first time, binding affinity data can be broadly correlated to physico-chemical properties, and new relationships can be discovered that explain structure-function relationships and molecular recognition.  The insights that will be obtained by this research are fundamental to understanding how small molecules influence the function of proteins.  Patterns governing ligand recognition can be used to predict substrate specificity, inhibitor binding, allosteric control, enzymatic catalysis, and structure-function relationships of proteins.      Broader Impact of the Project: In addition to these critical new insights, this research gives rise to an online resource, www.BindingMOAD.org.  The dataset is available to enhance the research and teaching efforts at all universities.  As codes are developed to mine Binding MOAD, they will be incorporated as online tools to help users pull useful patterns from the dataset, targeted to their own uses. Furthermore, the research efforts will give rise to new educational tools for the website that further expand this resource.  The database will also be expanded through semi-annual updates, keeping pace with the explosive growth of the Protein Databank.  Binding MOAD is currently used for active-learning exercises in courses at the University of Michigan, and it can be used to educate and train students at any institution.  The resource and online tools will be used by a wide range of disciplines (structural biology, protein science, biophysics, medicinal chemistry, theoretical chemistry, computer science, and bioinformatics).  The project can also improve access to science for students with physical challenges or visual impairments.  These students can often conduct computational research even if they cannot do experimental work.",Heather Carlson|

The project advances graph compression schemes that are universal and independent of the application to summarize massive graphs at large scales.  These algorithms should be highly efficient, using a small amount of space and time to produce a compressed representation.  Furthermore, these algorithms should be provably correct.  In addition, the tools should be adapted to dynamic graph data.  They should learn a model of the graph from historical data.  Finally, this project will design tools that can infer graph properties from samples of a massive graph, since such a graph cannot be observed in its entirety.  In applications where sampling schemes can be devised, we strive to do so as effectively and as efficiently as possible.    <br><br>    We live in an information age.  Behind many of our technological, scientific, and economic forces are large volumes of data.  An increasingly important type of data is relational data or graph data. These data capture how entities are related to one another, how they interact with one another, or how objects are linked together.  All forms of communication amongst entities give rise to graph data, including the communication of source and destination IP addresses via IP packets in the Internet, people sending email to one another, web pages referring to one another, or proteins interacting with one another in large biological systems.  Many scientific, engineering, and medical applications depend on our abilities to model, to analyze, to process, and to synthesize this type of data quickly, in the face of changes to the data, and under imperfect information.  Indeed, our security and the security of the Internet may hinge upon our understanding of how entities (be they people or IP addresses) interact with one another.  Our current statistical and algorithmic tools for relational data are not adequate for massive graphs.  They have not kept pace with our ability to collect enormous amounts of data and our need to accurately and efficiently analyze that data.  We must be able to model, to compress, and to highlight the important features of graphs that are gigantic, that evolve over time (perhaps quickly), and that may capture a limited view of a larger graph.

There is widespread agreement that these constructions are context-sensitive: what utterances of them mean is a function in part of the mutual presuppositions between the speaker and hearer about what scenarios are relevant.  For example, sentences of the form ""It might be that p"" mean (roughly) that some of the relevant scenarios are scenarios in which p is true.  But sometimes a speaker may take for granted more than their hearers do (their presuppositions about relevant scenarios not matching).  If the conversation is to proceed the hearer needs to accommodate by changing her picture of what the common ground is, thus changing what he or she takes the set of relevant scenarios to be.  The dynamics of this process, what its constraints are, and how it interfaces with the compositional semantics of modal and conditional constructions, are not well understood.  This project focuses on accommodation both to advance what is known about these constructions and to advance the general understanding of how context and semantic value interact.  Since the confluence of context dependence and contextual dynamics at the point of accommodation implicates both the speaker's and hearer's beliefs about what is shared information, the project will also promote a more general understanding of natural language by relating semantics to larger questions about how agents reason about and exchange information about a complex, dynamic world full of other agents.",Anthony Samuel Gillies|

Six factors promoting reproductive tourism have been cited in the literature.  These include religious prohibitions, lack of expertise and supplies, safety, discrimination against certain categories of individuals, shortages and waiting lists, and costs.  However, these causes of reproductive tourism remain conjectural, as this phenomenon has never been studied empirically. Thus, the proposed study is the first of its kind to investigate the new global phenomenon of reproductive tourism on an empirical level.      This study will investigate and compare reproductive tourism in two highly mobile, migrant communities in the Arab world: 1) the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the current tourist capital of the Middle East; and 2) ""Arab Detroit,"" the largest Arab ethnic enclave in North America and the so-called capital of Arab America.  Both of these sites are home to ART centers that cater primarily to Muslim populations. ART center clientele include migrants who have settled in these communities for economic and political reasons, only to discover that they are infertile, as well as ""reproductive tourists"" who travel from distant countries with the intention of receiving medical advice, the latest technologies, and, in some cases, donor gametes.    In each site, data will be collected to test four major hypotheses concerning: 1) the causes of reproductive tourism; 2) Islamic attitudes toward bodily commodification and human gamete donation; 3) arenas of constraint on ART-seeking; and 4) gender and marital relations, as they affect and are affected by reproductive tourism. These domains of inquiry are important, given unique features of reproductive tourism in the Arab world: for  example, a Sunni Muslim ban on third-party gamete donation versus recent encouragement of donor technologies in Shi'a Islam.  In addition, the Arab Gulf is a particularly interesting site of reproductive tourism, given its oil wealth, large expatriate labor force, and high rates of arranged marriage, consanguinity, and polygyny. This stands in contrast to Arab Detroit, where a significant portion of the approximately 400,000 Arab residents:, including many recent war refugees from Lebanon and Iraq, endure impoverished lives, yet require reproductive health services.  	  This  research is  the first of its kind to examine the growing global phenomenon of reproductive tourism within the Arab world and also generally.  As such, it will contribute to multiple fields of study, including medical anthropology, the anthropology of globalization, science and technology studies, gender studies, and Middle Eastern studies in a post-September 11th, war-in-Iraq era. In addition, the empirical findings of this research are of great importance to social policy, given increasing calls for legislation of ARTs and reproductive tourism on a global level.  This study can provide insights into the experiences and concerns of reproductive tourists themselves, thereby shedding light on a world of global reproductive tourism that is burgeoning, but still shrouded in mystery.",Marcia Inhorn|

A MMP generally involves multiple operations to produce a product, which can be found in many industrial processes such as automotive body assembly, machining lines, progressive stamping, and semiconductor manufacturing. In a MMP, each operation adds inherent design variation when no fault occurs, and special assignable variation when a fault occurs, to the workpiece variation. The output workpiece of one operation is the input of the next operation. The final product variation is an accumulation of variation from all operations. Therefore, the characteristics of variation propagation is very complex in MMPs, depending on both product and process design. The research efforts in the project will develop methodologies to achieve on-target production with minimum variance by addressing both design and manufacturing concurrently. The research focus is to develop: (a) a math-based model to describe the variation propagation in a MMP; (b) an integrated methodology for variation management through design synthesis and optimization; and (c) statistical methods driven by engineering models for quick root cause identification and product defect prevention. In addition to research, new curriculums and courses will be developed. Various collaborative efforts with industry, international universities, and K-12 schools will be conducted in research and education in the project.  If successful, the project results will enrich the science base and technologies in variation reduction and process control methodologies for MMPs, which include: (a) analytical (rather than empirical) modeling of MMP variation and its propagation; (b) synthesis (rather than analysis) of product/process tolerance for optimal management of inherent design variation to minimize their impact on final products; (c) real-time root-cause identification (rather than change detection) for manufacturing process control and continuous improvement; and (d) prognostics (rather than defect inspection) for defect prevention throughout the manufacturing lifetime. The developed unified methodology will generate significant economic impacts in industrial sectors where MMPs are used.

Unfortunately, this process largely remains a qualitative endeavor, one that features reviews of the questions by experts, focus group discussions with a handful of participants, and small numbers of intensive ""cognitive"" interviews.  Many researchers have questioned the effectiveness of these methods for identifying problem items.  In addition, there is a disconnect between the qualitative data produced by these conventional questionnaire pretest techniques and the quantitative standards (such as reliability and validity) that the data are meant to address.  This project will systematically assess the potential of a quantitative method -- latent class analysis (LCA) -- for use in developing and testing survey questions.  The project seeks to answer several specific questions about the application of LCA models as a tool for evaluating survey questions by conducting a series of new experiments and analyses of existing data.

This project will advance basic knowledge about various strategies, including the use of latent class models, for questionnaire development.  It will show whether these models can assess the measurement characteristics of survey items even in the absence of external validation data (such as administrative records).  The project will compare the latent class models to conventional questionnaire development techniques and determine whether they can yield better questionnaires, reduced questionnaire development costs, or both compared to the traditional methods.

The standard assumption underlying  asymptotic analysis that treats N (number of cross-section units) as fixed and let T (the number of  time series observations) to tend to infinity is no longer appropriate for analyzing large data panels.  The theme of the PIs research is efficient use of information in a large panel of data, say, X. The PI's  work will be organized around three projects. Project A continues the PIs previous work in using factor models to reduce the dimension of X. With N large, there is a need to carefully downweigh noisy data. The more difficult problem is to deal with the cross-section correlation in idiosyncratic errors that are not pervasive enough to be called common factors, but are strong enough to adversely affect the precision of the estimated common factors. In this grant, the PI's seek to develop more  efficient principal component estimators to deal with both problems.  Project B continues to exploit the relevant information in X, but now the goal is to predict  some series, y, and the PI's step outside of the factor framework. The problem here is to pick out a set  of reasonably strong predictors for y, but that the predictors are not very highly correlated with  each other, or else there will be too much information overlap. The PI's will use penalized regressions to  study optimal shrinkage. The goal is to establish data dependent rules for the penalty parameters  in a time series setting. For example, stationary and non-stationary predictors will be penalized at  different rates. Both in and out-of-sample predictions will be considered.  Project C aims to develop an efficient estimator for panel cointegration in the presence of cross-  section common shocks, which drive the comovement of economic variables. The framework allows  for cross-sectionally correlated errors and encompasses the fixed effects model as a special case.  Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit Standard principal component estimates are now  used in many forecasting exercises and in policy analysis. Improved factor estimates will inevitably  impact these work. Project A should lead directly to better estimates for the number of factors,  which has a natural role in asset pricing models and in demand analysis.  In addition to providing results of immediate use to forecasters, Project B also impacts macroe-  conomic analysis, as many economic models involve expectational variables. Economic hypotheses  cannot be fairly tested when the forecasts/conditional expectations are not properly modelled. Fur-  thermore, instead of predicting y, a researcher might just want to predict if y is higher, lower, or stays the  same. The many predictors framework is potentially useful in broader contexts.  When working with economic data, the assumption that the errors are iid across units is un-  appealing. Project C tackles efficient estimation when the errors are cross-sectionally correlated.  The results will be useful for economic analysis involving data for countries/industries/firms.",Serena Ng|Jushan Bai

In addition to the theory, the study offers new insights into diverse research areas such as finance, social dynamics and structure, and social networks.      There are both theoretical and applied components of this study in the area of social dynamics and structure.  The purely theoretical component develops a general theory of the non-concavity of the value of information, when measured in its natural units of sample size.  Unlike prior work on the static value of information, this new theory derives the entire schedule of the marginal value of information.  Starting with a new model of variable quantity information, the first methods employed for option pricing are used to solve the problem.     The applied theory component of the study offers two new insights.  First, social change may be punctuated and sudden.  In this sense, the non-concavity is a major agent of change.  While developed for a static setting, it applies dynamically, leading society only periodically to reevaluate the wisdom of its choices.  This forces punctuated social change, where so-called (S,s) rules arise without any fixed costs, and thus small causes can have big effects.    Second, the collection of information at the individual level fosters the exchange of information with neighbors, creating a scope for multiple equilibria and coordination failures in the social production of information.  In a word, convexity creates a complementarity that encourages multiple equilibria.  Ignoring this dimension, the design of labor markets, urban planning, career counseling, and anti-segregation policies might be grossly misguided.  The results illustrate the potentially harmful role of mass media in curbing the incentives for decentralized information collection and exchange, and for promoting local uniformity in social behavior.    The broader and long-run impacts of this project are far-ranging.  For example, increasing returns inherent in the demand for information creates the potential for a generic market failure.  In addition, the exchange of information is arguably the main purpose of social networking.  Informational networks increasingly appear to play a major role in shaping key social phenomena, such as the diffusion or clustering of employment opportunities, voting patterns, and financial investment attitudes.  This project is the first ever to explore the social implications of the fundamental non-concavity in the value of information.    The educational impact of this study would spans multiple fields.  The development of a tractable, transparent, yet rigorous benchmark model of information provides a tool to illustrate and teach these phenomena in fields where the demand and exchange of information play a central role, such as sociology, public health, telecommunication policy, and education.  It enables researchers from these different fields to establish a common ground and vocabulary, and fosters inter-disciplinary work.  The insights that information can be usefully measured and that it initially may well have increasing returns, has broader impact for many fields studying informed human behavior--from sociology to psychology.  This research also informs optimal policy towards research and development.  Furthermore, the analysis of the informational foundations for punctuated social change provides a useful informational tool for those studying the history of science through Thomas Kuhn's paradigm in his (1962) ""Structure of Scientific Revolutions.""",Lones Smith|Jussi Keppo

This project consists of a set of experiments that investigate how the presentation of the survey request affects nonresponse and measurement error.  The experiments are guided by a theory of survey participation (the salience-leverage theory) that claims that people decide whether to take part in a survey based on whatever aspects of the survey are made salient in the presentation of the survey request and on how they evaluate those features.  Two initial experiments randomly vary the description of the topic and sponsor of the survey, with hypothesized effects both on nonresponse propensities and on reporting.  In the third experiment, survey design features that can mediate or reduce the error-producing influences of the survey topic and sponsor will be examined.  Thus, the project experimentally tests mechanisms producing nonresponse bias and measurement errors and, once these effects have been documented, provides guidance to the survey practitioner about how to reduce their impact.    While the research is theoretically motivated and features experimental control, there are important practical implications of the work for the federal statistical agencies and the larger survey community.  Sometimes estimates of key social indicators (e.g., the prevalence of rape or the frequency of defensive use of handguns) vary widely across surveys.  The effects explored in this project may help explain these discrepancies.  In addition, this work will a) help agencies conducting surveys anticipate when different sponsors may obtain different results, b) provide evidence about potentially harmful effects on nonresponse error and measurement error of emphasizing a single purpose of a survey, and c) produce evidence regarding design features that can reduce the effects of the presentation of the survey on nonresponse and measurement error.",Roger Tourangeau|Robert Groves

Animated agents are anthropomorphic software objects in the user interface that, in their most advanced implementations, produce gestures, display facial expressions, and move their eyes in coordination with their speech.  They have been shown to improve user performance in some task domains (e.g. tutoring).  When might this technology help or hurt survey data quality and respondents' satisfaction?  How sophisticated must the agents be in order to provide benefit--or harm?  In a web survey, an agent might motivate respondents to participate and complete the task, much like human interviewers do, and help respondents understand the survey questions as intended while allowing respondents to participate at their convenience, as in ordinary web surveys.  On the other hand, the presence of an agent might discourage honest responding to questions about sensitive topics, much as human interviewers have been shown to do.  In this project a series of laboratory experiments examine more and less human-like agents that ask questions about respondents' sensitive and non-sensitive behaviors.  The studies contrast data quality and user satisfaction in non-agent web surveys to those with interface agents that vary in their dialogue capability, the degree to which they provide visual and spoken cues about their internal states, and the degree of intentionality in their speech.  The agents are simulated with software that converts a video image of a live interviewer into an animation in real time; respondents thus believe they are interacting with a computer-generated agent even though there is actually a human behind the ""agent.""  In the experiments about non-sensitive behaviors, respondents answer on the basis of fictional scenarios so that the accuracy of their answers can be determined.  One possible outcome is that agents with greater dialogue capability will promote interactions that lead to more accurate understanding and thus more accurate answers.  In the experiments about sensitive behaviors, respondents answer about their own lives; more reports of sensitive behaviors indicate greater respondent candor.  One possible outcome is that agents with more movement (lips, eyes, and eyebrows) will lead respondents to feel less private and therefore to answer less candidly than with agents whose movement is limited.  Respondents' satisfaction is measured with a post-interview questionnaire; the impact of different agent features on how respondents communicate with the survey system is measured by detailed turn-by-turn coding of all dialogue.    The practical impact of this work will be more informed decisions by survey researchers in adopting agent technology.  Knowing when agents help and what features help the most can focus decisions about what interfaces to develop and which ones not to develop.  For example, if dialogue capability is more important to data quality and user satisfaction than other agent features, this could focus future development efforts on conversational competence of agents more than on visual realism.  The theoretical impact of the proposed work will be in two areas.  First, it will deepen our understanding of how verbal and non-verbal communication are interconnected, for example how verbal interaction is affected by the fidelity of the agents' facial display.  Second, by comparing human-computer and human-human interaction the project will advance knowledge of how attributions of intentionality and human agency affect interaction more generally.

However, the concept continues to remain incomplete. Two issues remain to be resolved to complete our understanding of mantle plumes and their role in the dynamical and geochemical evolution of the planet. The first, and the subject of vigorous controversy, is the very existence and survival of plumes in an internally heated, convecting mantle dominated by the large-scale flow associated with plate motions. The second relates to the degree of geochemical variation revealed by the isotopic signatures of ocean island basalts, which we identify as the surface expression of mantle plumes.  In order to address both issues, PIs Lithgow-Bertelloni, Cotel, Whitehead and Hart are conducting laboratory experiments on single thermal and compositional plumes in homogeneous and stratified fluids. The primary goals of the present experiments are first, to accurately measure and characterize the buoyancy flux throughout an evolving plume as a function of the initial heat flux, and fluid composition, and second, to analyze the effects of shearing induced by the large-scale circulation on plume breakup and on stirring within the conduit. The emphasis lies in the use of new non-intrusive optical techniques (Particle Image Velocimetry, Laser-Induced Fluorescence, light deflection, and thermochromic liquid crystals for Digital Particle Image Thermometry).  These can directly measure the three-dimensional flow structure in addition to giving the simultaneous measurements of composition and temperature.    Over the next three years the PIs intend to provide rigorous scaling relationships to illuminate   -	The conditions that lead to steady plumes and steady-state conduits or plume breakup upon ascent  -	Spatial and temporal variations in plume structure as it relates to seismic imaging  -	The scales at which entrained material survives and interacts in thermal and thermochemical plumes  -	The link with the isotopic geochemical variability of ocean island basalt.  The funded project involves close collaboration between four PIs with widely varying scientific and technical expertise ranging from geophysical fluid dynamics to geochemistry. Hence, the results of these experiments are likely to be of interest to diverse segments of the Earth Sciences community.

This technique has the potential to develop an all solid-state cryocooler for a variety of applications such as sensor cooling. To date, solids have been cooled from room temperature to 208 K (temperature difference T = 92K). We propose to enhance the cooling performance using nanopowders, to T = 170 K. Absorption is increased by (a) increasing the population of participating electrons through dopant concentration optimization, (b) increasing the number of photons in the interacting volume by photon localization in nanopowders, and (c) increasing the number of participating phonons by phonon density of states optimization using nanoparticle size effect. This enhanced laser cooling performance will be demonstrated by a combined theoretical, computational and experimental investigation.  To our knowledge, this will be the first attempt of laser cooling in nanostructured solids, and the first time to bring laser cooling performance to cryogenic temperature range.

Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between increased morbidity and increases in measured ambient particulate concentrations.  The high number concentration and small size of nanoparticles lead to high rates of deposition deep in the lung. The ultrafine particles (< 0.1 micron) have been found to promote acute pulmonary response, and they impair the ability of the macrophages (the scavenger cells in lungs) to engulf and remove particles from the extracellular milieu.  Therefore, nanoparticles emitted by combustion sources are a very serious health concern because of both their size and the carcinogens with which they are associated. It is therefore important to characterize the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric particles.   Combustion is the main process through which man continuously injects particles into the atmosphere.  More importantly, these particles are produced at the smallest sizes physically possible in the form of clusters with nanometric dimensions The key feature of this proposal is its innovative multiscale characterization of nano-particle formation in combustion environments, through the use of novel simulation methodologies at disparate (spatial/temporal) regimes.  The use of atomistic models, such as Molecular Dynamics, can allow us to follow the transformations that occur during nanoparticle formation in a chemically specific way, providing information on both the chemical structure and the configuration of the nanoparticles and their agglomeration.    Carbonaceous nanoparticle agglomeration is influenced by large length and time scale motions that extend to mesoscopic scales, i.e., one micrometer or more in length and one microsecond or more in time.  In order to increase the time and length scales accessible in simulations and be able to simulate nanoparticle assembly, it is necessary to describe the particles on a more coarse-grained (CG) level.  The primary research objective of this proposal is to study nanoparticle coagulation and assembly using an unique multi-scale coarse-graining approach. With this methodology the effective forces between whole groups of atoms in the molecular system are mapped into much simpler effective forces for coarse-grained sites on the molecules (or nanoparticles).  These resulting forces are, in effect, the potential of mean forces between the coarse-grained sites (i.e., groupings of atoms). As a result, the effective phase space of the system is significantly reduced in size, as are the number of costly force calculations. The CG model will allow the simulations of the nanoparticle systems in this project to bridge upward in both length and time scale, so as to better access the properties influenced by those scales.  This approach provides a connection between the various time and length scales in the nanoparticle self-assembly problem, together with an unprecedented opportunity for the understanding of the atomistic interactions underlying carbonaceous nanoparticle structures and growth.    The integrated multi-scale simulation approach provides a detailed, molecular level description of the structure of fine particles, which are generated during the combustion of hydrocarbons.  With the results obtained using this novel approach, it will be possible to significantly broaden this research into important directions, such as the influence of these particles on human health and global warming.  The integration of experimental studies and theoretical simulations, in multi-level time and particle size scales, will increase the overall understanding of nanoparticle formation and transformation.  This is an important aspect of the intellectual contribution, beyond the increased scientific understanding at any one scale.  The research activities proposed will advance discovery through the development of computational models that will elucidate for the first time ever the mechanisms of nanoparticle formation in a chemically specific way.  The broader educational impacts of the proposed project will be significant as well, through the direct involvement of graduate students in the research project, as well as outreach activities in scientific education and to underrepresented groups. The research and educational activities combined will advance understanding through the teaching of computational chemistry and molecular modeling, which will provide students the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the physical and chemical processes involved using these multimedia-based approaches for effective teaching.",Angela Violi|

For the past 30 years four major conjectures have guided this area: Marden's Tameness Conjecture, Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture, the Bers-Thurston-Sullivan Density Conjecture and Ahlfors' Measure Conjecture; all have been resolved in the last four years.  The solutions of these conjectures have introduced new techniques into the field and opened the door to deeper investigation and the exploration of new directions.  In this Focused Research Group, the principal  investigators propose to use these new techniques to deepen their understanding of the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, both of infinite and of finite volume, to explore further their still mysterious deformation theory, to pioneer new directions for research in the field, and to develop connections with related branches of low-dimensional geometry and topology.    Since the time of Poincare, topologists have pursued the idea that certain spaces called 3-manifolds might be simply described.  In the 1970's, Thurston's geometrization conjecture showed topologists the power of bringing geometry to bear on this problem, and opened the possiblity for broad connections between topological, geometric and dynamical features that arise.  Using technical tools arising from recent breakthroughs, the PIs hope to interconnect further these different perspectives on the field, and expose early career mathematicians and graduate students to the new range of problems emerging from this fertile area.  The Focused Research Group will fund small conferences during its first and final year focused on emerging research areas, with introductory workshops to be run on the day prior to the beginning of the conference.

The Navier-Stokes equations constitute the basic mathematical model of fluid flow and are believed to contain turbulence among their solutions. Turbulent transport and mixing have important applications in, and implications for, many areas of applied physical sciences and engineering and present a number of outstanding challenges for theoretical physics and applied mathematics. The investigations will be carried out utilizing modern applied analysis, computation and numerical simulation with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers working under the direction of Principal Investigator Charles R. Doering at the University of Michigan. The project has three major components:   . Mathematical methods previously developed by principal investigator and collaborators for the study of turbulent transport in the Navier-Stokes and related equations will be extended and applied to the advection-diffusion equation and turbulent mixing. This analysis will place limits on mixing efficiencies for passive scalar fields in terms of bulk and statistical features of the applied flows, and indicate key features of particularly efficient or inefficient stirring strategies.   . Theoretical and mathematical issues in thermal convection will be studied via rigorous analysis and direct numerical simulation. Modern enhancements of the analytical techniques pioneered by the principal investigator will be developed and applied to open problems including homogeneous convection, Rayleigh-Benard convection with free-slip boundaries, infinite Prandtl number models and flows driven by internal heating with applications in geophysics.   . The turbulent energy cascade and enstrophy generation will be investigated for solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Variational approaches capable of bounding turbulence driven by time-independent body-forces will be extended and applied to time-dependent and broadband (fractal) forcing. Work in progress will continute to determine maximum enstrophy generating flow-field configurations, how they are related to structures observed in fully developed turbulence, and their role in the development of singularities.   With regard to the intellectual merit of this activity, knowledge gained from this project will contribute to fundamental understandings of mathematical models in fluid dynamics that are of direct relevance to many branches of applied science and engineering. In the long term this research wll aid the development of practical techniques for simulation, prediction and control of physical processes with applications ranging from meteorology to materials manufacturing.

Within the nuclei of most atoms, the neutron remains stable, but when freed from the nucleus, it is unstable. Free neutrons are an important tool for study of subatomic physics, because the decay and interactions of free neutrons reveal the interactions of its constituents and decay products.  Neutrons also have spin, a quantum mechanical property of fundamental particles. Spin is responsible for the nuclear magnetism exploited, for example, in NMR and MRI. The spin states also affect the decay and interactions of neutrons, and so the control of neutron spin becomes useful for more detailed study of subatomic interactions. In the proposed research, free neutrons produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory, at the new Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and at the nuclear reactor at NIST will be used in experiments that control the neutron spin. The results will reveal weak interactions and possible new physics beyond the Standard Model that summarizes known elementary particle interactions. The neutron spins in a beam of neutrons will be manipulated by selecting predominantly one spin state with a spin filter based on laser polarized 3He. The neutron spin can be reversed using magnetic fields that couple to the nuclear magnetic moment. Very precise measurement of the neutron polarization (i.e. the excess fraction of the selected spin state) and precise spin reversal are required to mitigate false effects that may arise in these experiments. Several of the techniques used in these experiments will be greatly improved over those of previous experiments.    Three major experiments will be undertaken. The objective of the first is measurement of the weak interaction effects on the absorption of neutrons by hydrogen. The weak interaction is characterized by absorption and emission of particles that have a handedness that correlates the spin orientation with the direction of motion. This handedness allows observation of the weak interaction amidst the much stronger interactions of neutrons and protons. Definitive characterization of the weak interaction between the neutron and proton is crucial to fully understanding the forces that bind the nucleus. This experiment will take data at Los Alamos before moving to Oak Ridge in 2007. An experiment at NIST aims to report the discovery of a rare mode of neutron decay, radiative decay, in which a photon is produced along with the neutrino, electron, and proton emitted in most neutron decays. The third experiment will be designed and apparatus built to detect the dependence of the direction of proton emission with respect to the decaying neutron spin. This proton direction dependence depends on the relationship of the multiple quantum paths from the initial neutron to the final decay products. It is affected by the intrinsic interactions among the fundamental particles that make up the neutron and proton and the emitted electron and neutrino. Advanced techniques of spin state selection, precision polarimetry, and spin flipping will be applied with the objective of precisely measuring the handedness of neutron decays. When combined with other neutron decay measurements these measurements will also probe physics beyond the Standard Model.    This work probes deep intellectual questions about fundamental issues in science. The aim is to collect data that will aid in understanding elementary particles and their interactions, but the techniques have much broader impact. Laser polarized 3He and 129Xe experiments can be applied to biomedical research, materials science, and quantum information research.  This project is an unusual training ground for undergraduate and graduate students. The technical challenges combined with the deep intellectual issues provide motivation and develop technical skills. Undergraduates will gain research experience working along with graduate and post doctoral fellows. Graduate students emerge broadly capable and move on to prepare for faculty or national lab positions. This work has also led to development of new courses for nonphysics majors, to a set of public lectures on Nuclear Magnets and Neutrinos and to communicating science to the interested general population. In the context of probing fundamental problems of physics, exciting in its own right, the hardest problems produce the most innovative solutions with spin-offs unimaginable at the outset. Atomic clocks, enhanced MRI, and probing the origin of matter all follow from the control of nuclear magnetism and neutron spins.",Timothy Chupp|

Roughly speaking and by analogy with the commutative situation, the category of graded modules modulo torsion over a noncommutative graded ring of quadratic, respectively cubic growth should be thought of as the noncommutative analogue of a projective curve, respectively surface. This intuition has lead to a remarkable number of nontrivial insights and results in noncommutative algebra. Indeed, the problem of classifying noncommutative curves (and noncommutative graded rings of quadratic growth) can be regarded as settled and the motivating theme behind  much of this proposal will be to understand noncommutative surfaces. A large class of these algebras can be classified in terms of the ``naive'' blow-ups developed in collaboration with Keeler and Rogalski. Although these blow-ups are constructed in a manner reminiscent of  commutative blowups, and depend upon geometric data, their structure is quite unlike the classical objects. A major portion of the project will be to further understand these objects and to extend their applications. The other major theme of the project will be in applications of this general theory to specific classes of algebras. A particularly useful technique, here, is to ``complete'' the category of modules over a noncommutative algebra to those over a graded algebra and then to apply noncommutative projective geometry. This has, for example, been used to relate rational Cherednik algebras in type A to Hilbert schemes,  and to Haiman's work on the n! conjecture. The project will continue this research to gain a deeper understanding of these important algebras and their relation to other areas of mathematics, for example to integrable systems and to the study of invariant eigendistributions on symmetric spaces.    Algebraic geometry, which is one of the oldest areas of modern mathematics, has its origins in the study of polynomial equations; for example a plane curve is the set of solutions of a polynomial equation in two variables. This leads to a rich interplay between that geometric object and the (commutative) algebra of  the associated polynomials. Noncommutative algebra, which is a much younger subject, also has its origins in the theory of equations, in this case matrix equations, and in recent years has become increasingly important in many areas of mathematics (for example the theory of differential equations) and physics (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a classic illustration, but more subtle non-commutativity occurs, for example,  in string theory). It has become apparent in recent years that there are definite, though often rather subtle, geometric structures hidden in these noncommutative objects and the interplay between the two has led to a rich theory, actually several theories, in their own right. These are collectively called noncommutative geometry.",J. Tobias Stafford|

Ulsoy and P.W. Nelson  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI  48109      Delays are inherent in many physical, biological, economic and engineering systems.  In particular, pure delays are often used to ideally represent the effects of transmission, transportation, and inertial phenomena. Delay differential equations (DDEs) constitute basic mathematical models for such real phenomena.  The principal difficulty in studying DDEs lies in their special transcendental character.  Delay problems always lead to an infinite spectrum of frequencies.  Hence, they are often solved using numerical methods, asymptotic solutions, approximations (e.g., Pade) and graphical approaches.  In this project a new analytic approach, based on the matrix Lambert function, for the complete solution of a system of linear constant coefficient DDEs is developed and expanded.  The method is validated, for stability, free and forced response, by comparison to numerical integration.  The method is also applied to an engineering problem where delay is significant: regenerative chatter in a machining operation on a lathe.  The matrix Lambert function based solution approach for DDEs is analogous to the use of the matrix exponential for the free and forced solution of linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equations.  The proposed research will seek extensions of the method, based on our recent results, to more general time-delayed systems. Specifically we propose to study systems with multiple delays, time-varying coefficients, and specific nonlinearities. Systems with multiple time delays and nonlinearities arise quite naturally in engineering and biology and yet little attention has been paid to their analyses. Our method should provide a framework for others to use in studying these complicated systems. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the potential development of specialized methods, based upon the matrix Lambert function approach, for solutions to important problems in systems of delay differential equations (e.g., observability and controllability criteria, controller and observer design, multiple delays, time-varying coefficients, or nonlinearities) that would facilitate the analysis of dynamical systems characterized by such equations.  The new method developed in this project will be demonstrated and validated by application to significant problems in science and engineering, for example, the dynamic modeling of HIV with delay and to regenerative chatter in the milling process.      The proposed research on the analytical solution of delay differential equations using the matrix Lambert function promises to be of wide interest to the mathematics, engineering and science communities.  The application to HIV will be of benefit not only to researchers in related fields, but will also benefit patients under medical care.  For example, the proposed method will be used to establish appropriate lab testing and drug therapy procedures for HIV treatment.  Similarly, the chatter stability results will be of benefit to the manufacturing industry.  Those results will enable manufacturers to determine the appropriate spindle speeds and depth-of-cut for their machines for chatter-free high-productivity operation.  The project will serve as a doctoral thesis topic for an interdisciplinary graduate student, who will be co-advised by the two PI's, who are faculty in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics departments respectively, and will also involve an undergraduate student, from an underrepresented group in science and engineering, to develop examples and software using the methods developed in this research.",A.

Particularly,  it is concerned with estimates analogous to those of the  Phragmen-Lindelof theorem which gives uniform upper bounds for  pluri-subharmonic functions that are bounded above at the real points  of the complex Euclidean space and satisfy an asymptotic linear growth  rate.  A new geometric condition, that the variety is nearly  hyperbolic, is proposed to characterize such properties.  The new  condition gives a precise sense in which the variety has many real  points, and is intermediate in strength between having a full  dimensional set of real points and admitting a projection map with  real fibers over real points.         The project aims to determine the geometric properties of  algebraic and analytic varieties in Euclidean space that determine  when the analytic functions on the variety have properties similar to  those of entire functions on Euclidean space.  It is motivated by  connections with the properties of solution operators for systems of  constant coefficient partial differential operators and convolution  operators on global smooth functions.  The goal is to give algorithms  for deciding whether or not specific operators admit solutions and  solution operators on spaces of infinitely differentiable functions  and distributions.

The research program is motivated by the scientific and engineering significance of attitude control problems, the lack of prior research on global attitude control with control constraints, and by prior theoretical and experimental research of the principal investigator on attitude dynamics and control.  The key feature of the 3D pendulum, as for all attitude control systems, is that the set of all possible attitude configurations is a compact, noncommutative Lie group.    The control problems to be investigated fall into two categories: algorithms and computational methods for open loop optimal and near-optimal attitude control maneuvers and Liapunov-based methods for closed loop attitude stabilization using feedback.  In each category of attitude control problems, new results will be globally valid without requiring use of local attitude charts or coordinates.   A physical implementation of a 3D pendulum, referred to as the triaxial attitude control testbed (TACT), is the basis for the experimental part of the research.  The TACT, consisting of a rigid base body supported by a near-frictionless air-bearing pivot, is an excellent laboratory-based research tool for studying the practical aspects of attitude dynamics and control.     The research is motivated by important attitude dynamics and control problems that arise in diverse scientific and engineering fields.    Important applications of constrained attitude dynamics and control include robotic devices such as gantry cranes and construction equipment for transporting rigid bodies loads; advanced ground-based pointing and tracking systems; and numerous space applications including inertial platforms and spacecraft attitude stabilization and maneuvers.  The research also has important connections with full body problems in celestial mechanics, such as the mutual dynamics of binary asteroids and the near Earth passage of asteroids.   The research on global attitude control of the 3D pendulum, with control constraints, is motivated by these applications and it will seek to develop spin-off results in several of these areas.",Nathaniel McClamroch|

In the theory of overconvergent classical modular forms,  the canonical subgroup of Lubin and Katz (for a p-adic analytic family of elliptic curves) has been an important tool. The recent interest in p-adic modular forms beyond the classical case has motivated several different constructions of canonical subgroups for abelian varieties,  and recent work of the PI has led to another higher-dimensional theory   that, at least in its geometric aspects, has a wider range of applicability than the other approaches. The PI proposes to use deformation-theoretic methods to make explicit certain abstract estimates in the theory, and to draw   arithmetic consequences for p-adic families of automorphic forms.  In another direction,  the PI and co-workers have used methods from   deformation theory and rigid-analytic geometry to develop a theory of a   new global parity obstruction to randomness properties of prime   specialization of inseparable irreducible polynomials over  certain coordinate rings of curves over finite fields.  This has given   rise to families of elliptic curves with unexpected rank behavior  over global function fields (under some standard conjectures) and seems   likely to have further Diophantine applications  to Mordell--Weil ranks for families of abelian varieties over global   function fields. The PI proposes to develop a better  understanding of this basic arithmetic phenomenon and to work out some   further consequences for ranks in families.    Number theory is among the oldest subjects in mathematics, since it is   ultimately concerned with the relatively concrete  problem of studying properties of whole numbers.  Such problems can   take on the form of finding whole number solutions  to systems of equations in many variables, or problems relating to   properties of primes, and so on. Typically one has to bring in some deeper structural information (provided by geometric, algebraic, or analytic ideas) to make progress on such questions, and in the last several decades a very wide range of sophisticated geometric techniques have been developed to attack these problems.  Moreover, though the initial motivation comes from within pure mathematics, security of  electronic telecommunications has come to be related in an essential way to many of these number-theoretic problems (such as  prime factorization and studying points on curves over finite fields)   and the geometric concepts used to attack them.  This proposal focuses  on both geometric and prime factorization questions that arise in   several number-theoretic settings, aiming to develop some  new theoretical methods and to apply them to specific problems.  In   addition, the PI proposes to continue his long-standing tradition of supervising high-level number theory research by talented high school students and giving talks to larger groups of students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.

Intellectual Merit of this project will be the (1) development of biosensors based on energy of emission (not intensity) and (2) understanding the rules of interactions between the nanoparticles and nanowires.     Broader impact of this project is an enabling technology for the fields of microfluidics and biosensing, which will lead to the development of new potent drugs and new diagnostic tools.  The proposed devices will also help to carry out more sophisticated water quality control, and new tools for biomedical research.    Additionally, the project has educational efforts associated with the sensor research with middle/high school students and exposing them to the fascinating world of nanotechnology.

The proposed integrated microsystem will have an array of chemical actuators capable of controlling the diffusion of proteins into tissue.

The system will continuously monitor the state of the transcription factors and adjust distributed dosing of proteins. The PIs will address a fundamental open question in developmental biology: is a Turing / Meinhardt reaction-diffusion model appropriate to describe mesodermal patterning in Zebrafish? We will explore how the Zebrafish embryo generates the complex patterns of differentiation that lead to a mature organism.

Generally, interactions between polymer chain  segments and interfaces impose enthalpic and entropic penalties on the chain structure, and these  effects may be manifested in properties at length scales beyond the size of a chain, up to tens of  nanometers (nano-scale). Properties such as the viscosity, chain diffusion coefficients, D,  glass transition temperatures, Tg, phase separation temperatures of mixtures and copolymers, as  well as morphological instabilities are known to exhibit film thickness dependencies. To date, a  comprehensive understanding of such size-dependent phenomena in polymers remains elusive.                            The foregoing provides the basis for three problems examined in this proposal. (1) One  goal is to understand how interfacial forces influence the chain dynamics and to understand the  connections between chain dynamics and the film thickness dependent changes exhibited by the  Tg in homopolymer and in miscible polymer-polymer systems. The strategy of our proposed  experiments is predicated largely on the notion that the glass transition is a manifestation of  underlying dynamical features in the system. (2) We also plan to examine how the concentration  and spatial organization of nanoparticles affect the morphological stability, chain diffusion and  average Tg of polymer-based nanocomposite thin film systems. (3) Finally, we examine the role  of interfacial energetics and intermolecular interactions on the late-stage (coarsening) structural  evolution in unstable and metastable thin polymer films on substrates.                                                                   Intellectual merit: In simple liquids, the relation between diffusion and viscosity is  established within the context of the Stokes-Einstein equation. With regard to bulk long-chain  polymeric melts, the Doi-Edwards theory describes the interrelation between diffusion and  various viscoelastic processes exhibited by these materials; the temperature dependence is  understood in terms of the WLF (or equivalently the Vogel-Fulcher) equation. In thin films,  however, the situation is unclear. Through a series of experiments, guided by predictions based  on simulations and theory, connections between the thickness dependent quantities are examined  for thin film polymer-polymer mixtures. The second part of this proposal is devoted to  developing an understanding of the influence of polymer/nanoparticle interactions on the glass  transition and on dynamics (segmental dynamics and morphological instabilities) in thin film  polymer-nanoparticle nanocomposites. Questions regarding the effect of interfaces, coupled with  size-scale dependencies, are unresolved, though simulations suggest strategies to examine them.  Our goal for the third problem, is the development of an understanding of the role of interfacial  energetics and intermolecular interactions on late-stage coarsening processes in morphologically  unstable and metastable thin , supported, polymer films.                                                                                         Broader Impact: This is an interdisciplinary program cross-cutting different fields, from  physical chemistry of surfaces (wetting and self-organization), processing of thin films  (morphological stability, viscosity, glass transition) to two dimensional coarsening phenomena  (an issue also of interest for the processing thin films for microelectronics and is part of the  broader ubiquitous phenomenon of coarsening). While it is true that we now understand a great  deal about how to tailor properties of bulk polymers through blending etc. we are at a stage of  infancy with regard to thin films. The thickness dependencies of the phase transitions, selfassembly  and various morphological changes that result from the actions of intermolecular forces  are endemic. An understanding of these issues will help us to develop new rules to design or to  tailor properties of thin films for various applications. Clearly, the questions addressed in this  proposal have scientific and technological implications. Students participating in this project  develop an interdisciplinary background in areas that range from physics, materials and chemistry  to engineering.",Peter Green|

This proposal  calls to bolster the training of post-docs and graduate students  in all of these areas by deepening and broadening it and  providing them with ample opportunities to excel in their  research.  Five faculty members (Mario Bonk, Richard Canary, John  Erik Fornaess, Juha Heinonen and Ralf Spatzier) will lead this  project in collaboration with eleven other senior faculty.

Geometry, topology and dynamical systems are core areas of  mathematics. Geometry investigates the shape of spaces, through  invariants such as curvature.  Topology explores the properties  of spaces which remain invariant under deformations such as the  number of holes in a surface.  Dynamical systems concern the  evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time.  Especially in recent years, they have developed in mutually  beneficial interaction.  Case in point are topology, geometry and  complex dynamics in low dimension which in many aspects mirror  each other.  Many of the most exciting developments in these  areas are truly interrelated, and benefit from each other either  by idea, analogy or actual tool.  At the same time, connections  with other fields such as algebraic geometry and mathematical  physics have strengthened dramatically.  These developments have  been amazing in their breadth and depth, and demonstrate the  vitality of these areas.  This project will train young  researchers in these exciting and interconnected fields, and will  help insure their future health and continued interaction.",Ralf Spatzier|John Fornaess|Richard Canary|Juha Heinonen|Mario Bonk

These stability results will add credibility to the use of the Kerr metric in detailed astrophysical models.

It investigates the stability of black holes under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations.  Such understanding is of great importance for predicting the nature of gravitational radiation originating in outer space.  The stability problem will be considered in a manner parallel to the observations made by astronomers, leading to a better theoretical understanding of numerical modeling of solutions of Einstein's equations.  The project also aims to put the question of extracting energy from a rotating black hole on a firm theoretical basis.  The extraction of energy from a rotating black hole was proposed in 1968, but until recently the question was far too difficult to be studied.

Proposed research includes the study of the dynamics and stability of LR systems (systems with left-invariant Lagrangian and right-invariant constraints), the properties of nonholonomic integrators, navigation and stabilization problems for systems with controls applied to internal degrees of freedom, applications of variational integrators to the method of controlled Lagrangians, dynamics of infinite-dimensional nonholonomic systems, integrable nonholonomic systems, and the use of overdetermined coordinates in mechanics and control. The investigators also plan to use geometric methods to develop a systematic approach to the construction of coordinates in the phase space that take into account intrinsic properties of a system under investigation and thus allows the researcher to write down equations of motion in a simple and compact way. This approach should be helpful both in understanding the dynamics of a system and in doing numerical simulations which respect mechanical properties.      The dynamics of systems with constraints is important in various industrial and scientific applications. Examples of such constraints include rolling and sliding, chained rigid links, rotor dynamics on rigid bodies, and coupling between elastic rods and rigid bodies.  There are numerous instances in industry, engineering and science where such constraints arise: robotics, the dynamics of wheeled vehicles, and the motion of satellites in space are examples. In applications, stabilization of steady-state motions (such as the straightforward or circular motion at a constant rate) is often desired -- for example in achieving a desired robotic or autonomous vehicle motion. Our methods should be helpful in achieving such motions and in general in analyzing and prescribing the motions or robotic and autonomous vehicles.

The first is to study measured  metric spaces with nonnegative Ricci curvature in a general sense. Many of the known  results about Ricci curvature for smooth spaces have extensions to nonsmooth spaces.  However, there are also many results known for smooth  spaces, for which the nonsmooth extension is unclear. The proposed research will  explore the extent to which the curvature properties of nonsmooth spaces resemble those of smooth spaces. The second main topic is Ricci flow.  The Ricci flow, introduced by R. Hamilton in the 1980's, is a way to evolve the  ""shape"" of a space by means of its Ricci curvature.  Recently, Perelman has made  spectacular use of the Ricci flow to address the most important problems in three-dimensional topology.  The long-time behavior of the Ricci flow is largely unknown and will be addressed in the proposal. In addition, the extension of Perelman's results to three-dimensional orbifolds will be considered.    Overall, the proposal is concerned with the idea of curvature.  Historically, curvature was first considered for curves in the plane, and then for  curves and surfaces in three-dimensional space.  Riemann showed how to make sense of the curvature of a smooth space of arbitrary dimension. In  fact, there are various notions of curvature - the sectional curvature defined by  Riemann and the Ricci curvature, which is an averaging of the sectional  curvature.The Einstein equation of general relativity is phrased in terms of Ricci curvature. Ever since Riemann's time, there has been interest in making sense of the curvature of nonsmooth spaces.  Alexandrov gave a good notion of what it means for a nonsmooth space to have nonnegative sectional curvature.  Recent work, in collaboration with Cedric Villani, has  given a good notion of what it means for a nonsmooth space to have nonnegative Ricci curvature.  The definition is in terms of  ""optimal transport"", a subject which has a history in applied mathematics.  Part of the research in the proposal uses ""optimal transport"" to  study the geometry of nonsmooth spaces.  Going the other way, ideas from  geometry will be used to address issues in ""optimal transport"".",John Lott|

Its principal goal is the  investigation of the dynamical and geometric structures of  ""higher rank"" systems.  Such systems appear naturally in  dynamical systems, geometry and even other seemingly quite  differnt areas such as number theory.  The investigator will  study rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and  semisimple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal  of classifying such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical  hypotheses.  In particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic  abelian actions, and actions by semisimple groups and their  lattices preserving affine and geometric structures.  The  investigator will also investigate rigidity properties of actions  of discrete groups in rank one semisimple Lie groups.  In  addition, he will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially higher  rank ones) and their geodesic flows.  Geometric, dynamical and  group theoretic tools will be used in this research.    Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively young fields  that investigate the evolution of a physical or mathematical  system over time (e.g. turbulence in a fluid flow).  New ideas  and concepts from dynamics such as chaos and fractals have  changed our perception of the world fundamentally.  Dynamics and  ergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and analysis for  these investigations.  Dynamical systems have had a major impact  on the sciences and engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance  has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for  computer science.  Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used  as far afield as cell biology and meteorology.  Geometry is one  of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies  curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their  shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.  Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now  studied for its close ties with physics and other sciences and  applied areas (computer vision e.g.) as well as internal  aesthetic reasons.  Geometry and dynamics are closely related as  some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and  geometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems.  One  main goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems  commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes  brought on by the other.  Important examples of such systems  arise from geometry.",Ralf Spatzier|

In this proposal, the IP plans to study the large scale geometry of  S-arithmetic groups and to prove the integral Novikov conjecture in surgery theory and K-theory for them. Since many natural S-arithmetic groups such as SL(n, Z[1/p]) contain  nontrivial torsion elements, this proposal emphasizes a generalized integral  Novikov conjecture. S-arithemtic groups act naturally on products of symmetric  spaces and Bruhat-Tits buildings. The PI also proposes to study compactifications of Bruhat-Tits buildings. Another closely related class  is the class of mapping class groups, which act on the Teichmuller spaces. The PI also plans to study the integral Novikov conjecture for the mapping class groups by using suitable compactifications of the Teichmuller spaces.          Symmetry is a fundamental notion in science and art.  In fact, it has played a pivotal role in modern physics.  Among infinite discrete groups, arithmetic groups are special and important. For example, the groups underlying the symmetry of  tiles, wallpapers and crystals form a class of arithmetic groups.

First, the effects of polydispersity in arm and backbone length on the linear viscoelasticity of well defined entangled H polymers, which have two branch points and four arms, will be studied. Recent models show that H-branched polymers should have rheology that is very sensitive to polydispersity, so that these studies, along with corresponding theoretical work, will allow strong tests of these theories to be carried out, and help in the development of a more accurate theory of branch point motion.  Second, using model materials from Dow Chemical Co., linear viscoelastic data will be obtained that will be sensitive to higher order effects of branch point motion and used to test the ability of an existing algorithm, the hierarchical model, to predict accurately these data. The third problem will be to test the principle of universal scaling of linear and nonlinear rheological properties in polymer solutions, which holds that all such properties, when measured at a fixed value of the ratio of c/ce, the concentration to the entanglement concentration superpose, when plotted in dimensionless form. This concept will be tested thoroughly by measuring sets of linear and nonlinear data for different molecular weights, at several fixed values of c/ce and by extending these tests to binary blends of linear polymers.     NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    	Over 200 billion pounds of polymers are produced commercially worldwide, and shaped into a wide variety of products.  The shaping processes depend on their flow properties, or rheology, which, in turn, depends on molecular characteristics, such as molecular weight distribution and branching distribution. Thus, there is a huge industrial interest in better defining the relationship between polymer molecular structure and rheology. The proposed work will increase knowledge of this relationship, leading to polymers that are designed better at the molecular level.  Insights from this grant, and past grants from the same NSF program, will assist in collaborations the proposer has with Dow Chemical Co. and Procter and Gamble. A new book, co-authored by the proposer, Molecular Structure and Rheology of Molten Polymers, published this year, contains work from the previous NSF grants, and the work to be carried out under the new grant will similarly be well publicized, both to U.S. industry and overseas, through international collaborations.  The work data will also lead to improvements in a commercial software package IRIS, for predicting rheological properties of polymer melts, that is used widely in industry.",Ronald Larson|

The identification of new alloying approaches that provide strengthening and stability at these temperatures, within the constraints of casting processes that are viable for automotive-scale production, remains a critical materials challenge. The relative lack of fundamental understanding of the behavior of potential high temperature magnesium alloys systems, compared to that for other structural alloy systems, has been identified as a critical obstacle to significant progress in the search for new lightweight, high temperature magnesium systems. To address this a collaborative research program (FRG) between the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin, with strong collaboration from Ford Motor Company and General Motors is initiated. Key gaps in the fundamental understanding of solidification, phase equilibria and deformation mechanisms in selected magnesium alloy systems will be investigated in order to establish a strong foundation for the design of alloys that meet the multiple demands required for potential use at high temperature. This will be accomplished by: (1) selection of promising systems on which future alloy development programs are likely to be conducted, (2) establishment of full thermodynamic descriptions of these systems through a combined modeling and experimental effort, (3) evaluation of key aspects of the solidification behavior of these systems under realistic casting conditions and (4) investigation of mechanisms of high temperature deformation creep. Two quaternary systems, Mg-Al-Ca-Sr and Mg-Al-Ca-Nd, will initially motivate the research and will permit us to build on existing academic and industrial collaborations. Anticipated outcomes include (1) definition of microstructural modification strategies for improvement of creep properties, (2) identification of higher order elemental additions that can be used to alter solidification paths for critical microstructural control, (3) realistic approaches for improving the stability of intermetallic phases near the grain boundaries, (4) refined thermodynamic descriptions and alloy design tools and (5) new quantitative approaches for evaluation of solidification and casting behavior of Mg-based systems. NON-TECHNICAL: The research program is designed to stimulate a more concentrated national research effort on high temperature cast magnesium alloys, by serving as a nucleus of research activity and university/industry collaboration. The educational experience of the undergraduate and graduate students in the program will be greatly enhanced by interactions with industrial personnel as well as by direct access to their unique research facilities, particularly those of the Ford Motor Company and General Motors. A particular strength of the core collaborative group is the physical proximity of the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin to each other and to the U.S. automotive manufacturers (and suppliers). The program would bring the U.S. academic activity on lightweight Mg alloys closer (but certainly not equivalent) to observed levels of research effort in Asia and Europe. The program will also enhance academic courses within the core MSE curricula at both Michigan and Wisconsin. Finally, resources from this program relating to energy efficiency and lightweight materials will be made available to the ASM International High School Teachers Camp, which is hosted annually at the University of Michigan.",J.

To fabricate such devices, small channels with particular light-guiding and light-amplifying properties are created on a glass plate, by changing its chemical composition along specific patterns near the surface.  Adding elements that are most effective from optical and photonic points of view is curbed due to poor compatibility with the glass structure.  This research is to develop a novel technology for the eventual manufacture of planar waveguides, based on ion beam implantation of the optically active elements into a precursor of the glass.  A new manufacturing process is expected to improve the performance of planar waveguide devices manifold and help facilitate new technologies, such as optical computers and data storage.  In carrying out this project, future engineers and scientists are trained in glass science and computational materials research.  The findings of this work will enter the public domain and contribute to the body of information used in public and industry outreach activities.  TECHNICAL DETAILS:  The focus of the proposed investigation is the insertion of atomic and nano-sized particles into a glass matrix to achieve particular functions, such as light guiding or photoluminescence.  Non-equilibrium processing routes, combining low-temperature sol-gel synthesis and ion implantation, will be explored to create porous and dense amorphous structures that can accommodate optically active embedded species at concentrations and spatial distributions that significantly improve the performance of planar optical waveguides compared to current capabilities.  The fundamental aspects of how precursor chemistry, implantation doses, and processing schedules affect the structure and properties of the waveguide materials will be investigated through in-situ structural characterization using concurrent Brillouin and Raman light scattering measurements, complemented by MD simulations, Rutherford backscattering, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and photoluminescence measurements.

While much research effort is directed at preventing such a failure, the fundamental understanding of shear-band behavior is still incomplete. The goal of this work is to obtain a deeper understanding of the relationships between the structure and properties of shear bands, and the dependence of both on thermal relaxation. This goal will be achieved by a combination of targeted experiments and modeling. Shear bands will be formed under varying conditions, and their structure and thermal and mechanical properties will be characterized. Experimental techniques to be used include conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, nanoindentation, spring-back measurements and conventional mechanical tests. Chemical disorder will be explored as a source of diffraction contrast in transmission electron microscopy. The use of a synchrotron x-ray nanoprobe for shear-band characterization will be explored. The high amount of free volume at shear bands offers an opportunity for studying the behavior of metallic glasses in a highly unrelaxed state. Experiments aimed at direct characterization of the local properties of shear bands will be performed. Deformation modes in samples containing shear bands will be explored for a range of strain rates. The high stability of bulk metallic  glasses will allow an extensive study of the effect of relaxation on properties. One goal will be a determination, based on several properties of the extent to which the ""memory"" of shear bands can be erased by relaxation.

Their high elastic limit and yield strength are attractive for structural applications, which have become a reality with the development of bulk synthesis. The broader impacts are scientific, technological and educational. The expected results will improve the fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship in metallic glasses. They will contribute to the knowledge base for structural applications of metallic glasses. These studies will help educate and train graduate students.

In such matter, new particles emerge with very unusual properties. For example, in most conductors electrical current is normally carried by electrons with a well-known charge of e. In superconductors, current is carried by pairs of electrons with a charge of 2e. By contrast, in fractional quantum Hall liquids, current is carried by unusual particles with fractional charge of e/3, e/5, and so on. Since electrons are known to be indivisible, the emergence of such fractionally charged particles has been one most fascinating manifestations of many electron quantum phenomena. This project will study these fascinating new particles using devices called single electron transistors. The single electron transistor can be turned on and off by a single electron, and is thus the most sensitive charge sensor in existence. Using this type of a highly sensitive transistor, magnetic properties of quantum Hall liquids will also be explored. On the educational side, the project will provide excellent training for participating graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor physics and nanoscience. In addition, an outreach activity will be mounted in collaboration with a local science museum to promote the interest of K-12 students in science and engineering.       ******TECHNICAL ABSTRACT******  This project will address some long-standing fundamental problems in two-dimensional electron systems. Excitations of fractional quantum Hall liquids are predicted to carry fractional charge and obey unusual fractional statistics different from those of fermions or bosons. Fractionalization and statistics of quasiparticles will be studied using single electron transistors in an antidot geometry, which will allow the researchers to perform both noise and Aharonov-Bohm type interference experiments. The statistics of the carriers will be addressed by first loading the edge states around the antidot with a controllable amount of charge and then by monitoring the phase change in an interference experiment. The use of single electron transistors to study bulk transport properties in quantum Hall liquids will enable investigations deep in the insulating regime where conventional transport measurements cannot be performed. On the educational side, the project will provide excellent training for participating graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor physics and nanoscience.

The goal of this project is to examine the removal of mantle lithosphere from under the Sierra Nevada.  The PIs assert that the Sierras are an excellent place to look because delamination appears to have happened rather recently, and may still be happening.  Preliminary studies indicate possible mantle ""drips"" at both ends of the Sierra.  The proposal(s) seeks to identify the removal process and the fate of the delaminated portion ..., i.e. the drips.  Through combined magnetotelluric (MT), geochemistry, geomorphic studies and geodynamic modeling, integrated with existing and proposed passive seismic data, the PIs seek to gain understanding of how mantle lithosphere is removed, and the conditions that facilitate such removal.  The hope is that this understanding can be applied elsewhere.  Removal of mantle lithosphere may have played a key role in regions with histories and structures as diverse as the southern Sierra Nevada, the Alboran Sea, the Tibetan Plateau, the Apennines, the Appalachians, central Andes, the Carpathians, Precambrian South Africa, the North China Craton, and the Basin and Range.  However, in many of these other regions where mantle lithosphere may have been removed, the removal is either too old or in an environment too complex, or logistically too difficult to expect a record as clear as in the Sierra.  The proposed project will build on the results of two previously funded CD projects, the Southern Sierra Continental Dynamics Project (that found that the southern part of the range was supported not by thick crust, but by a hot, low-density upper mantle) and the Sierran Paradox Experiment (that discovered that eclogite had been removed from the base of the crust in the latest Miocene or Pliocene time).    A strength of the project is the PI's intent to conduct a joint analysis of MT and seismic data.  As stated, this joint analysis will use a more quantitative coupling of MT and seismic results based on the underlying physical properties which produce the observables (e.g.  petrophysical behavior of mantle olivine and pyroxene based rocks with and without water).  The PIs seek to tie seismic velocities and electrical resistivity via poisson's ratio, attenuation, and anisotropy.  Such a joint inversion method, particularly if it can provide some measure of mantle hydration, would advance the ability to geophysically image the mantle lithosphere.      This project is paired with a project that has been funded by EarthScope (Sierra Nevada EarthScope Project - SNEP) to conduct a seismological investigation with the FlexAray component of EarthScope in the central Sierra Nevada.  The PIs of SNEP are G. Zandt, T. Owens, and C. Jones.  Currently focused on the northern edge of the region where lithosphere is known to have been removed, the seismological work will place limits on the extent of lithosphere removal and delineate the seismological structures resulting from that removal.  This CD project explores the variations in geological and other geophysical observations across the same region with the goal of identifying those features clearly associated with removal of the lithosphere.  Although each of these studies will yield useful results without the other, the combination of them should exceed the sum of the separate parts.",Marin Clark|

Over millions of years, these plates deform at their boundaries as well as internally, producing plate-bounding shear zones such as the San Andreas Fault, basins, and mountain ranges. Much of this deformation occurs seismically, which generates an earthquake hazard in regions that are experiencing deformation. Ultimately, the forces that drive these dynamic surface processes originate within the Earth's deep interior, which flows as it convects. While Earth's surface plates are the surface expression of this convection, the details of how their motion and deformation is related to the motion of the convecting mantle is not well constrained. Yet, it is essential to understand this plate-mantle interaction, which ultimately controls plate tectonics and the surface deformation that we observe. This project is designed to constrain the interaction between mantle flow, tectonic stresses, and plate motions.  	PIs Conrad and Lithgow-Bertelloni are using spherical finite element models of viscous mantle flow to predict the forces that the mantle exerts on the base of Earth's tectonic plates. These forces are then used to predict two fields that can be observed from the Earth's surface. First, plate velocities are predicted by balancing the forces on each of Earth's tectonic plates. The comparison of predicted motions to observations lead to further improvements in the numerical model. Second, the PIs compute the stresses experienced by an elastic lithosphere that is subjected to basal shear tractions associated with mantle flow and plate motions. These stresses are statistically analyzed against observations of lithospheric stress made in boreholes, from moment tensor solutions for earthquakes, and from geological observations of lithospheric deformation.  	To quantitatively assess the degree and variability of plate-mantle coupling, the PIs focus on the influence of viscosity heterogeneity beneath the elastic lithosphere. The material strength of the rocks beneath the lithosphere is thought to vary between geological provinces. For example, oceanic and thin continental lithosphere may be underlain by low-viscosity asthenosphere that is weaker than the upper mantle while old continental shields may reside over thick, strong cratons that protrude deeply into the upper mantle. These extreme lateral variations in viscosity greatly influence the coupling between the mantle and the lithospheric plates. In doing so they affect plate motions, patterns of lithospheric stresses at the surface, and the long-term geological deformation of continents. The PIs are developing rigorous models of lithosphere-mantle interaction, calibrated against a variety of observations. Specifically, the PIs hope to further illuminate the range of material properties that characterize the sub-lithospheric mantle, and to gain a better understanding of how the mantle controls surface deformation and the background stresses associated with seismic hazards.  	This funded project involves the close collaboration between the two PIs with varying scientific and technical expertise ranging from numerical modeling to geology. Hence, the results of these experiments are likely to have a broad impact and to be of interest to diverse segments of the Earth Sciences community.

Models of 3-D seismic structure take a central place in the research of Earth scientists from a wide range of disciplines.    The traveltime (of a body- or surface wave) is the most popular data type in tomography. Traveltimes are available in seismological catalogs, or they can be measured in a relatively straightforward manner. Moreover, traveltimes can be related to velocity heterogeneity in a linear fashion, simplifying the tomographic inverse problem. Millions of traveltimes constitute modern data sets. However, do tomographic models explain other attributes of wave propagation and how do simplified wave theories compromise model accuracy? These are the questions we are addressing in our research.    We are analyzing 3-D Spectral-Element Method (SEM) wave simulations [Komatitsch and Tromp, 1999; Komatitsch et al., 2002] to investigate how 3-D seismic models can be improved using observables that are traditionally not used in tomographic inversions.    (1) Body wave amplitudes  We have demonstrated [Ritsema et al., 2002; Komatitsch et al., 2002] that the pattern (but not the amplitude) of SS/S amplitude ratios can be explained by shear velocity heterogeneity in the mantle for model S20RTS. We are investigating whether these body wave amplitude ratios can be used to constrain the  (lateral) gradients of shear velocity in the mantle, which we suspect to be underestimated by tomographic models.    (2) Frequency-dependent body wave traveltimes  We are observing a systematic variation of body wave traveltimes between 20-100 mHz. While such a variation is expected on theoretical grounds [Dahlen et al., 2000], we are using SEM simulations to investigate whether this signal can be used to constrain the amplitude and spectrum of heterogeneity in the mantle.    (3) Resolution of ""small-scale"" heterogeneity  We are analyzing SEM waveforms to conduct new resolution tests that explore whether ""small-scale"" (i.e., < 200 km) structures produce observable traveltime or waveform variations. We are particularly interested in constraining the mantle structure of Iceland, a region overlying an anomalous mantle upwelling.    Broader Impact: The research is supporting the training of a Geophysics student in seismological data analysis and advanced scientific computing.

The focus is  on systems which arise by averaging the multidimensional Euler  equations of fluid dynamics. The averaging process produces  source terms that are inherently in nonconservation form, whose   presence has major consequences for the theory as well as for  computations of solutions. Computational difficulties include   nonuniqueness of solutions, loss of strict hyperbolicity, lack of   guiding principles in discretizing nonconservative products and    difficulties to compute accurately near steady-state solutions.   The aim of this project is to understand, from a numerical view   point, how these various characteristics are interconnected,   to identify numerical features that need to be respected  and provide design principles which lead to simple and efficient  numerical schemes. This research program will be carried out by studying  a series of nonconservative models, and offer numerical frameworks within   which the computational difficulties may be addressed:  (i) a   relaxation approach addressing the loss of hyperbolicity, and   inaccessibility of eigenstructure; (ii) discrete averaging models,   giving accurate estimates on closure terms and providing unambiguous   approximations for nonconservative products; (iii) hybrid algorithms   for two phase flows, which preserves the correct jump conditions across   discontinuities in coefficients. As an application, the methods will be   used to study two layer exchange flow between reservoirs, and extended  to multilayer shallow water flows through a channel contraction.   Analytical predictions are available and will be used for validation.      Physical equations of the type considered in this project are used to   model a wide range of fluid flows. They are used to model large scale   atmospheric and oceanic flows over terrains, and to describe ground flows   in porous media. They model river and coastal flows, dam breaks   and flooding, such as the flow in the Rigolets strait connecting   the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Ponchartrain near New Orleans. They are used   in hydraulics, to describe and control exchange flow between reservoirs.   In multiphase flows, they model the dynamics of droplet suspensions such   as sprays in environmental applications, or cloud dynamics, which may be   important in visibility military applications. Alongside experiments  and theory, numerical simulations constitute a major tool of study in   these applications areas, and the issues addressed in this project are   fundamental to their development. To date, numerical methods for balance   laws are still facing major challenges, and provide incomplete and   unsatisfactory answers. The directions outlined in this project address   these challenges, they are original, they are new and they emphasize   general design principles that can be exported to other systems of   similar structure. The completion of the proposed project is expected   to have a significant impact on computational practices in these   communities.",Smadar Karni|

These are mixed-phase clouds that contain both ice particles and supercooled liquid droplets, and can occur between 0C and -40C. Whether a cloud is composed of ice or liquid is crucial for determining how much of the incoming radiation from the sun it reflects back to space and therefore crucial for climate prediction. The PI is interested in how dust aerosols and smoke from biomass burning or other anthropogenic aerosols acting as ice nuclei influence the microphysical and radiative properties of these clouds as well as the extent to which precipitation formation processes are altered. To achieve this goal an aerosol model has been coupled with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) General Circulation Model (GCM), Community Atmospheric Model (CAM). As part of the PI's present research, she has implemented ice crystal mixing ratio and number concentration prognostic equations in the NCAR CAM in order to study aerosol-cirrus-climate effects, based on a new parameterization for the effects of dust, soot, and sulfur aerosols on these cold clouds. This study will extend this parameterization to treat deposition nucleation and contact nucleation in warm ice clouds (T > -40C). Data developed during the forthcoming Ice in Clouds Experiments (ICE) will be used to guide the development of the parameterization. A cloud parcel model with size-resolved microphysics will be used to both simulate conditions during ICE and to develop the ice nucleation parameterization. This parameterization will then be included in the ice phase microphysical processes in the CAM model. CAM coupled to the IMPACT aerosol model will be used for simulations for the present-day and pre-industrial climate to assess the effects of anthropogenic aerosols. The PI will also examine the possibility of trends observed in dust concentration and their effect on ice clouds and climate. Available data from satellite and lidar observations will be used to evaluate her results.    In addition to the project outlined above, the PI plans to continue her collaboration in the European-based Quantify Project. Quantify is a European-funded project under the Sixth Framework Programme with 40 partners and 8 separate work packages. The main goal of QUANTIFY is to quantify the climate impact of global and European transport systems for the present situation and for several scenarios of future development. The PI's main effort in Quantify will be to compare the predictions of her coupled aerosol/climate model (the IMPACT model coupled to the NCAR CAM model) with ice microphysics to the predictions of a cloud-resolving model from the Danish Meteorological Institute.     The intellectual merit of this project lays in its contribution to an understanding of the possible role of both dust and anthropogenic ice nuclei in indirect effects on climate.     The broader merits of the project lie in its contribution to the science that is useful for policy decisions. Moreover, graduate students will participate in the research, so that this project will contribute to graduate training. Additionally, during March 2007, Penner will be teaching the ""clouds and precipitation"" course at Michigan. Real time data from the ICE experiments planned for this time frame will be used in an end-of-term project to acquaint students with the role of field experiments in understanding ice nucleation phenomena.",Joyce Penner|

These mites, in the family Pyroglyphidae, are the primary cause of house dust allergy in millions of people. Pyroglyphid mites belong to a larger group of mites, the Psoroptidia, which includes almost exclusively parasites, living permanently on the bodies of birds and mammals. Most workers regard the Pyroglyphidae as the ancestral group for many parasite lineages, simply because this family includes the only non-parasitic psoroptidian species, i.e. the house dust mites and their relatives living in bird or mammal nests.  Another hypothesis suggests the house dust mites have evolved from permanently parasitic ancestors, violating the evolutionary truism once a parasite, always a parasite.  The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the parasitic mites form a single evolutionary lineage. Nucleotide sequence data from 12 different mitochondrial and nuclear genes obtained from at least 140 species representing most of the higher level diversity of psoroptidians and their relatives will be analyzed using the latest techniques. Furthermore, a number of new species have been and will be discovered during this study. These will be described and a new classification of the Pyroglyphidae proposed.    This project will also provide training in systematics, molecular phylogenetics and parasitology to undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students. Over 20 undergraduate students and six doctoral and postdoctoral students have been trained in the PI's lab over the course of the last two funding cycles, over half of them women and several belonging to underrepresented minorities.

These capabilities depend on two foundational techniques.  Virtual-machine introspection allows the system to understand the execution  of a virtual machine as it executes or replays, without perturbing that  execution or replay.  Virtual-machine replay allows the system to re-execute  a past time interval of the virtual machine instruction-by-instruction, yet  at only a few percentage overhead in time and space.    The ability to browse the past execution of one's computer can benefit  society by providing new capabilities to administrators, users, and  programmers.

Leading technology experts have started warning computer designers that device reliability will begin to wane heavily in the next five to ten years. This will lead to skyrocketing manufacturing costs and severely shortened product lifetimes. To address such an important and imminent problem, this research focuses on the development of effective, low-cost mechanisms to protect a computing system from silicon defects, both those occurring during manufacturing and those that occur while the device is in operation in the field. The objective is to provide solutions that detect the occurrence of a failure, correct any affected computation, and repair the hardware silicon fabric, all with minimal cost and performance impact.     To assess the upcoming exposure to silicon defects, this project includes the development of a high-level silicon reliability modeling infrastructure, based on high performance simulation software and high-level modeling of the failure mechanisms. Once this exposure is analytically evaluated, the core of the research investigates solutions which attack the problem by exploring a novel combination of cost-efficient online defect testing and novel memory management. These two powerful technologies combined have the potential to lead to solutions that provide at least as much reliability as traditional approaches, but at significantly lower cost. Initial studies suggest that such solutions are much less expensive than previously proposed defect-tolerance techniques, due to the time and space efficiency of the underlying mechanisms.",Valeria Bertacco|Todd M.

The prime example is the cell phone, but the emergence of many new classes of such devices is expected.  These devices will improve on the cell phone by moving advanced functionality, such as always-on Internet access, high-definition streaming video, and human-centric interfaces with voice recognition.  One of the key ingredients to pervasive computing is wireless communication.  Mobile devices must be able to seamlessly interface to whatever communication services are available as they are moved from location to location, such as different cellular networks and wireless local area networks.  Software defined radio (SDR) promises to deliver flexible solutions by implementing wireless protocols wholly in software.  SDR executing on programmable hardware substrates facilitates the inter-operability, flexibility, and support for new features that pervasive computing requires.  Further, SDR prevents getting locked into fixed and outdated standards that traditional hardware-centric solutions are often faced with.  This project focuses on hardware and software innovations to create platforms for SDR that are both programmable and scalable to the projected bandwidth requirements for the next ten years. Innovation in a single direction is not sufficient to accomplish these goals.  Rather, a multi-layered approach, consisting of innovation hardware, compiler, and algorithms, is used.    Across these three dimensions, this project will develop general techniques for decomposing signal processing algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism, compiler technologies orchestrating the execution of communicating sequential tasks on multicore computing systems, and platform-wide power-aware architectural techniques for supporting SDR on mobile computing devices.",Scott Mahlke|Trevor Mudge

However, these tools are generally aimed at ordinary or weighted least squares regression and do not account for stratification, clustering, and survey weights that are features of data sets collected in complex sample surveys.  The ordinary least squares diagnostics can mislead users because the variances of model parameter estimates will usually be estimated incorrectly by the standard procedures.  The variance or standard error estimates are an intimate part of many diagnostics.  This research will adapt existing diagnostics for use with survey data, and, where necessary, develop new ones.  This project also will study the properties of existing linear regression diagnostics when they are applied to complex survey data.  Extensions are needed to cover both clustered and unclustered data.  The particular techniques to be studied are: leverages for linear regression and their heuristic cutoffs for influence; distributions of leverages, including histograms and quantiles; modification of unit-deletion measures of influence on model parameter estimates and predicted values and the rules-of-thumb used to identify influential observations; change in standard error estimates due to deletion of an observation or groups of observations; and extension of collinearity diagnostics, including variance inflation factors and variance decompositions for parameter estimates.

Others are much more open-minded and deliberative by their nature.  Most of us, of course, fall somewhere in between.  Whether a political event, speech or news story stimulates in us a thoughtful mulling over of alternatives or triggers an impulse to rally around a particular partisan flag depends on how issues are framed and linked with familiar linguistic and pictorial symbols, particularly those that signal threat or stimulate enthusiasm, anxiety or aversion.  This is the focus of this project.    This study undertakes an analysis of three possible responses to new political circumstances: 1) seeking additional information, 2) seeking a balance of information from multiple perspectives, and 3) exhibiting openness to compromise.  In initial research, strong evidence of the importance of the distinction between an anxious and an aversive response to new information was uncovered.  This leads to a rethinking of the overused and potentially misused characterization of 'negativity' in political rhetoric and advertising.  This research was based on the study of a single issue, at one point in time and with a student population.  In this study, our initial results are tested - over time, over a diverse population and over a range of political issues including 1) economic well being, 2) physical health, 3) physical safety and security, 4) threats to core values, 5) threats to ethnic and religious identity, and 6) threats to national identity.  This work is designed to establish a fresh line of scientific inquiry on human attention and inattention to complex political stimuli utilizing novel measurement strategies and research design.     The project involved a systematic content analysis of 120 real-world news stories from which 30 sets of evocative 'stimulus stories' were developed in the form of manipulated online news narratives.  These materials were presented to student and non-student adult subjects including video, text and graphic images as a test of a new, personalized, computer-based 'News Machine.'  This analysis included validity testing and focus group research to better understand the dimensionality of this domain and the character of short-term individual responses to risk.     In the second year, we selected ten now relatively well-understood stimulus sets for a 10-week, four-wave panel study of a nationally representative sample of 900 adults in coordination with Knowledge Networks Inc. The use of the relatively rare panel design and a field rather than laboratory setting permits the analysis of more realistic behaviors resulting from exposure to political news under different conditions.  Real-time online information seeking behavior is assessed through an innovative methodology pioneered by Knowledge Networks.  Individual versus collective responses to news stimuli are also a subject of measurement development.

First, the researchers study the economic and social consequences to countries of having a large number of political parties competing in national-level elections, especially parties that represent sub-national geographic areas.  Second, they collect and archive election returns for many of the world's democracies at the electoral district level.  Both tasks are valuable.  The former enhances the understanding of the consequences for countries of specific political systems characteristics.  The latter enable the researchers to conduct their own research and also enable other researchers, journalists, and intelligence analysts to conduct their research on the politics of other countries.     Most centrally, the researchers investigate whether having a large number of political parties competing has important consequences for the country's population.

With this knowledge the researchers enhance our understanding of which institutional features lead to more or less political parties, which in turn can lead to improved lives for people in democracies.   In other words, by linking formal political institutions to political parties and then to policies and the policy outcomes, researchers gain leverage in understanding the consequences of institutional design, especially for new and developing democracies.    As part of this project, they will be gathering and archiving constituency-level election data for use by the broader research community.  They will create the Constituency Level Election Archive (CLEA), a public archive that benefits those studying comparative elections and parties, or those needing data on parties and party systems to study other aspects of politics, culture, economics, and society.   This archive is a unique, useful, accessible source of constituency-level election data from many of the world's democracies.     This project has four kinds of broader impacts.  First, findings from the study inform policy-makers about the important causal connections between institutional design, party system characteristics, and policy-making.   Second, the researchers make their data widely available through the CLEA archive.  This enables scholars, policy analysts, diplomats, and intelligence analysts to use the data to study the causes and consequences of party system characteristics, and to analyze election results for other purposes.    Third, the data collection portion of this project involves a great deal of collaboration with graduate and undergraduate students.",Kenneth Kollman|Allen Hicken

This 2010 project will generate a 'parts list' of peroxisomal matrix and membrane, using bioinformatics and proteomics, followed by fluorescence microscopy and protein fractionation. Further, the functions of peroxisome-targeted proteins will be analyzed with various assays on sequence-indexed T-DNA insertion mutants. Finally, peroxisomal protein complexes and networks will be explored, using gel-based methods in combination with mass spectrometry. Approximately 300-500 genes encoding peroxisomal proteins will be associated with biological functions, which is a critical step toward developing a comprehensive model for plant peroxisome function. This project will provide the scientific community with a much-needed comprehensive inventory of peroxisomal proteins and a large set of tagged reporter constructs for follow-up studies. All information will be integrated into the AraPeroX database (http://www.araperox.uni-goettingen.de/) and mirrored on the project website http://www.peroxisome.msu.edu. Information and materials generated will be available to the public in a timely fashion through our project website, TAIR, and ABRC. Given that different cell compartments are often linked via peroxisomal functions and that peroxisomes are crucial during stress responses, this project will benefit several fields in the plant community and achieve synergistic impact with other ongoing 2010 projects, such as the plastid functional genomics project. Results from this research will also expand our knowledge of eukaryotic cell biology and provide useful information to engineering crop plants for increased stress resistance and improved oil production.    Broader Impacts: Research and education will be integrated by multidisciplinary training of undergraduates, high school students and teachers, and teachers from primarily undergraduate colleges. The data, resources, and techniques generated in the project will be useful to a broad community of scientists.",Laura Olsen|

The present instrument offers full range of scanning probe (SPM) techniques ideal for research areas ranging from material science to polymer characterization. The liquid imaging package included in the instrument expands its applicability to biological research and the optional MFM mode of imaging will facilitate its application in the research involving magnetic materials. This instrument will be used to support several interdisciplinary research programs including (1) in situ synthesis of metal nanoparticles on monolayer templates, (2) vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays on metal and semiconductor surfaces to develop a new sensitive and rapid DNA-detection method, (3) nanostructures generated from self-assembly of diblock copolymers to create DNA/protein nanoarrays, (4) single molecule-based activity of metal binding protein like Metallothioneins (MTs) or metallothionein-like (MT-L) proteins in yeast, (5) research on spintronics and (6) dilute magnetic semiconductor materials. Development of such a program will lead to unique opportunities for undergraduates to participate in multidisciplinary research areas of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology and also promote the participation of under-represented minorities in biological and physical sciences. As an outreach program, the proposed instrument will provide an opportunity to develop new science activities/workshops to introduce the interdisciplinary aspect of biology and nanotechnology to high-school students in the Detroit metropolitan area, and will also create opportunities for them to actively participate in summer research.     Lay Abstract    Nanotechnology is the use of novel and unusual properties, phenomena, and processes that occur when size is reduced to 0.1 to 100 nanometer (one nanometer is one billionth of a meter), and the advent of nanotechnology brings together physics, chemistry, material and biological sciences. It has already brought and further promises to bring new devices that will revolutionize many areas of our technology. Nanobiotechnology is an emerging area of science which connects nanotechnology to biological systems. An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), which is considered as the ""eye of nanotechnology"", is an integral part of this interdisciplinary area of science owing to its unique capability of direct observation and understanding of nanometer scale molecular structures present in chemical and biological systems. The AFM in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-D) will attract prospective students intending to work in the interdisciplinary research areas involving physical and biological sciences like nanotechnology/nanobiotechnology. In addition, this instrument will have a major impact on our plan to develop a number of courses involving nanotechnology and will further expand the opportunity of undergraduate student participation in faculty research programs. The AFM will also be of great support to the current outreach program of the department with local community colleges and to improve the K-12 science education of Detroit metropolitan area.",Krisanu Bandyopadhyay|John Thomas|Vaman Naik

STEP's goal is the creation of faculty change agents through intensive faculty study of key processes in the career trajectory of scientists and through intervention activities. The proposal draws on the social science literature regarding unconscious bias, accumulation of disadvantage, critical mass, and theories of organization and seeks to contribute a new model for intensified institutional change.  The project goal is to engage groups of male and female STEM faculty in a program of self-education and commitment to becoming active change agents within their academic institutions.  The program will bring together several successful activities developed in the course of the UM ADVANCE Institutional Transformation project. This project will contribute a new model for intensified institutional transformation by engaging senior faculty in an intensive (concentrated) and extensive process of becoming change agents within a network of faculty committed to the same goals, and supported over time.    Broader impact: The program will directly reach 300 STEM faculty drawn from UM, the Midwest region, and nationally. The first cohort of UM faculty will participate in networks of later participants, some of whom will also take actions nationally within their disciplines, increasing the impact on the STEM fields. All faculty participants should become better advocates within their institutions and serve as models and leaders for colleagues. Because faculty participants will be operating in departmental teams and larger networks, they will also model alliances of men and women scientists and engineers. The project will include the development of a companion website that will serve several purposes. It will provide information about the model developed through this project, including resources, reading lists, and a toolkit for developing similar programs at other institutions. In addition, it will manage a discussion board to allow participants to maintain connections developed through participation in the program and provide opportunities to share information and as well as help one another problem-solve particular challenges.",Abigail Stewart|Constance Cook|Janet Malley

John O'Shea and Alex Barker and a team of American and Romanian colleagues will conduct a multi-year project of archaeological testing and excavation at the site of Pecica Santul Mare in western Romania.  The project builds on a highly successful pilot season, also funded with NSF support.  The research team brings together expertise in geology, metallurgy, material science and biology, as well as expertise in Bronze Age and Dacian archaeology, to investigate the age and character of this pivotal archaeological site.      The great tell at Pecica holds a unique place in the history of European archaeology.  As one of the earliest excavated Bronze Age tells in Eastern Europe, its long sequence of occupation provided the standard for dating the later prehistory of Middle and Eastern Europe.  The calibration of the Pecica sequence using modern dating techniques such as radiocarbon dating will greatly enhance the research value of Pecica's unique long sequence of occupation and will serve to recalibrate existing collections from literally hundreds of archaeological sites across Eastern Europe.  In addition to its chronological significance, Pecica was an important early center for the manufacture and distribution of metal work during the Bronze Age.  As such, the site can provide a laboratory for documenting the organization of early bronze metallurgy and trade as well as for understanding the character of social change during the Bronze Age.      The Pecica project will generate a plethora of important scientific results.  The project will establish a secure chronological framework for Pecica and the eastern European Bronze Age, and will document how the rise of metallurgy and trade during the Bronze Age contributed to changes in the organization and complexity of society within continental Europe.  In addition, the excavations will provide the first systematically collected evidence for the subsistence and economic basis for these large Bronze Age settlements, and for the technology of metal production.    Among its broader impacts, the study will foster international scholarly collaboration in a region that until recently was isolated from most research in the English-speaking world.  The collaborative work will enhance the sharing of expertise and techniques among American and Romanian researchers and provide major training benefits for American and Romanian students.  The project also will ensure that a controlled sample of archaeological materials from this historic, but endangered, site is preserved for posterity.",John O'Shea|

Recent research has not demonstrated a strong relationship between nonresponse rates and nonresponse bias.  Nonetheless, best practices argue that researchers should attempt to maximize response rates.  One voiced concern about practices involving nonresponse reduction is that reluctant people in the sample, successfully brought into the respondent data set through persuasive efforts, may provide data filled with measurement error.  However, no study has looked at links among the propensity to be a respondent, true values on a question of interest, and the respondent's measurement error properties for that question.  The research will fill this gap by addressing three questions.  First, under what circumstances is nonresponse propensity related to the survey variables of interest?  Is noncontact or refusal nonresponse more likely to induce nonresponse bias?  Second, what is the relationship between nonresponse propensity, nonresponse bias, and measurement error?  In particular, how do properties of questions and characteristics of respondents affect the nexus between nonresponse bias and measurement error?  Is nonresponse propensity arising from noncontact or that from refusal more susceptible to a correlation with measurement-error bias?  Third, can traditional statistical adjustments or analytic techniques remedy the problem?  Data from two national and two regional surveys will be analyzed to answer these questions.  The research will demonstrate when placing resources into nonresponse reduction is outweighed by increases in measurement error on key statistics.  The research also will suggest changes to be made during field collection or in postsurvey adjustments that jointly account for two error sources: nonresponse and measurement error.     Sample surveys are the mechanism by which key indicators of the nation's well-being are created and through which mechanisms of personal and societal changes are tested.  Understanding error structures of sample surveys - both in terms of when errors occur and the mechanism behind their occurrence - is critically important because conclusions made from surveys could be dramatically wrong.  As nonresponse rates continue to rise, survey organizations are increasing their persuasive efforts in an attempt to maintain a representative sample on which inferences can be made.  If these persuasive efforts actually lower the quality of data, then the additional funds for these efforts are misguided.  The findings from this research will inform survey practitioners in how to conduct surveys and obtain better quality data and the scientific community that uses surveys to understand when survey-derived findings may be at risk.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.

The organizations include USAID, the World Bank, two Ecuadorian indigenous organizations, and an Ecuadorian municipal government.   Democracy promotion has been an important consideration in American  foreign policy and also at the forefront of demands by social movements in many parts of the world. But because the democracy literature  focuses primarily on formal regime change and political institutions, it leaves largely unexamined local meanings and everyday practices. This project is designed to fill that gap by examining the many meanings of participatory democracy.    In this multi-sited and multi-year project, the researcher will employ use  ethnographic and historical approaches to examine three key dynamics: 1) how USAID and World Bank discourses and policies are interpreted and deployed by the aid agencies working in Ecuador; 2) how the indigenous movement and local indigenous organizations are understood among the World Bank and USAID staff, and conversely how these social movement organizations view and interact with the development agencies; and 3) how the municipality of Cotacachi  makes sense of and seeks to transform these circulating discourses and policies as it collaborates with agency staff on local projects. Her research methods include participant-observation, interviews, cultural consensus analysis, and archival research. This research is important because it has direct implications for clarifying the aims, methods, and approaches of foreign aid, public policy, development programs, and social movements  oriented toward promoting democracy. It also will contribute to contemporary social science research that tries to integrate data on a single issue but at different levels of scale.

The project studies the co-evolution of knowledge capabilities and industry structure by investigating the automotive airbag industry in the U.S.  Several characteristics make this industry a good example for industry emergence in the high-tech sector. First, the product is complex and knowledge intensive, and combines multiple knowledge domains (mechanical, chemical, electrical/electronic, software, and textile), and thus its evolution presents an interesting case for studying the path of knowledge building and combination. Second, the industry experienced rapid growth over a relatively short time period. After twenty years of delay due to legal maneuvers between government and the auto industry, the automotive airbag industry grew from non-existence into a multi-billion dollar industry in less than fifteen years.  The project has two major objectives.  First, firms' knowledge creation strategies will be documented and categorized by mapping their patenting activities from 1970-2000. To do this, a database that includes all patents filed in this industry, and all patent citations will be created. For coding purposes this patent data set will be augmented with data from archival sources. This quantitative information, particularly the citation patterns, will allow investigation of the paths of knowledge creation  (its flow, additions, and combinations) over time. Second, through combining the data on knowledge creation paths with data on firm success, such as firm survival and market share, the role of knowledge creation for firm success, and ultimately for the evolution of the industry structure, will be investigated.  The project will build theory by (a) describing the paths of knowledge creation in emerging high-tech industries, and (b) explaining the effect of these knowledge creation strategies on firm performance and industry structure. Considering technological, economic, strategic, and legal aspects, the project will contribute to a better understanding of the co-evolution of technological innovations and the related industry structure.  The improvement of the understanding of both the role of knowledge for competitiveness in emerging industries and its path of creation will help to increase the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing firms.

In close collaboration between applied mathematicians and physical oceanographers, model predictions will be validated with in-situ data collected from recent/on-going/future field campaigns and satellite radar images. High accuracy numerical integration of the Euler equations will be implemented and will offer further cross verification of the internal wave model for a series of prototypical test cases. Specifically, this research activity will: (1) generalize and improve newly derived  first principle models to describe two-dimensional internal waves propagating in a multi-layer system approximating continuous density stratification; (2) verify the models with fully nonlinear numerical solutions of the Euler equations for several crucial  physical processes; (3) incorporate new parameterizations of energy dissipation by internal wave breaking and bottom friction, guided by available laboratory experiments and new direct numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations;  (4) incorporate coupling with models for surface signatures and radar backscatter, and compare these with South China Sea radar data; and (5) set the basis for the validation of the models with three sets of field experimental data (ASIAEX, WISE/VANS, NLIWI) in the South China Sea focusing on genesis and evolution of internal solitary waves.     This highly interdisciplinary project will provide a comprehensive but practical tool for predicting and monitoring internal wave activity in the ocean. Such a component of ocean dynamics has recently become more accessible to direct observation thanks to technological improvements in instrumentation. With these advances, it is now possible to appreciate that extreme events, such as the large internal waves with amplitudes of up to 140 m observed in the South China Sea by the Asian Seas International Acoustics Experiment (ASIAEX), occur frequently and carry tremendous energy which can result in, among other things, the generation of strong currents and ensuing mixing and distribution of heat and other ocean tracers. Accurate prediction of these dynamical features of the earth coupled ocean and atmosphere system is becoming more and more important as human activity expands and is increasingly affected by, and affects, the evolution of this system. The education of future researchers in this area requires further sophistication and flow of information between the mathematical and geophysical application.

The approach will be to develop a novel surgical thermal management system with real-time in-situ tissue temperature monitoring and feedback control to minimize the collateral thermal tissue damage in prostatectomy, hysterectomy, and neurosurgery. The system will use temperature sensors placed near structures of interest to provide temperature feedback and maintain a safe thermal dose, thereby avoiding tissue damage. Finite element modeling and inverse heat transfer solutions will be solved to predict the temperature profile in tissues during the prostatectomy and other surgical procedures. These models will serve as the foundation for the control algorithms of the surgical thermal management system.  The system will be proven in the ex-vivo model.    If successful, this research will minimize thermal damage in surgery and increase the post-operative quality of life for 600,000 women and 167,000 men who annually undergo hysterectomy and prostatectomy procedures in the US, respectively. Thermal damage to neurovascular bundles has been targeted as playing a major role in post-operative incontinence for men and women and impotence for men.

As the device integration level reaches the projected terasbit scale (1012 devices/cm2), novel, radical changes in device structures and architectures will be needed to facilitate the escalating demands of defect tolerance and massive interconnects associated with nanoscale devices. Reconfigurable architectures, in particular, crossbar structures in which the active components are hysteretic resistors formed at the points where two nanowire arrays crossing each other, have emerged as a leading candidate. The crossbar scheme offers inherent defect tolerant capability, as the circuit can be easily rerouted around defect components. The simple two-terminal active device structure makes it suitable for aggressive scaling, with the potential that both logic and memory functions can be integrated in the same entity. In a typical crossbar structure, arrays of metallic nanowires are used as both the interconnects and the contact leads, and self-assembled molecules are proposed as the active, hysteretic component. However, switches based on molecules suffer from serious issues such as low yield, slow switching speed and low on/off ratio, which greatly affect their application potential.    In this proposal, we present an alternative, solid-state based system that precisely addresses these issues, by utilizing an a-Si/c-Si heterostructure as the active component in a metallic nanowire crossbar array. Compared to molecule based devices, the Si heterostructure devices offer comparable scalability down to nanometer scale, while exhibiting nearly ideal properties for hysteretic switching, such as high yield, fast switching speed, well-defined thresholds and high on/off ratio. Furthermore, intrinsic rectifying behavior, a property that eliminates crosstalk and is highly desirable in the crossbar scheme, can be achieved in our device structure through proper material engineering. The proposed Si heterostructure crossbar arrays will offer up to terabit-scale density in a defect tolerant, reconfigurable architecture, while being fabricated on a reliable platform that is also compatible with available Si technology. In particular, high density, non-volatile memories with integrated decoder devices that interface the nanoscale components with microscale electronics will be demonstrated. General logic applications based on the crossbar structures will also be explored, with emphasis on a hybrid crossbar/CMOS approach.     The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary in nature, and requires close collaboration with chemists, materials scientists, and computer scientists. The research component of the activities described in this proposal will be closely tied to educational and other activities intended to broaden the impact of the proposed research. The research will provide educational and training opportunities for a graduate student who will be exposed to state-of-the-art experimental techniques and given a chance to present his or her results at appropriate conferences. Undergraduates will be routinely involved in the research as well. For example, first and second year undergraduates, who would not otherwise be exposed to cutting-edge research, will be directly involved through U-M's UROP program. Summer research opportunities will also be offered to undergraduates through U-M's SROP program and NSF's REU program.

Since human activity has been causing significant increases in the concentration of atmospheric aerosols, it is extremely important to understand the effects of aerosols on climate. Understanding the role of natural aerosols and how they are influenced by humans is important to the quantification of aerosols' radiative forcing on climate. Recently found evidence suggests that dust electrification and the resulting electrical forces play an important role on dust lifting. This aerosol-climate problem is being addressed by developing a physically-based dust lifting model and using it to study the effects of electric forces on dust lifting and transport by regular wind-blown saltation, dust storms, and convective plumes and vortices. The model is the first to include dust electrification and the potentially important effects of electric forces on dust lifting. The model will be made available to the scientific community as soon as it is developed and tested.    Electric fields as high as 100-200 kV/m have been measured in all types of natural dust lifting processes such as wind-blown saltation, dust storms and convective vortices. Laboratory research shows that these electric fields can directly lift soil particles from the surface. Calculations show that these electric fields can greatly reduce the threshold wind speed necessary to initiate saltation. Saltation is the process by which larger sand particles are moved by the wind and bounce on the surface, ejecting smaller dust particles into the air. Electrostatic effects may enhance this process. They are being measured in field and laboratory settings. These observations form the basis for including electrostatic effects in a parameterization for the dust lifting and transport by convective plumes and vortices in weather and climate simulation models. This dust flux parameterization includes the transport of both natural and man-made aerosols from the atmospheric surface layer up to the top of the convective layer.    The research has several broader impacts on science and society. Besides studying an important scientific problem key to our understanding of global climate change, the dust lifting model and dust flux parameterization will be available to the scientific community for use in a wide variety of modeling contexts. An educational website is being developed with simple physical explanations of the formation of convective plumes, dust devils, and dust storms. This website compares weather phenomena on Earth and other planets. It will be expanded to include explanations of saltation, dust electrification, and the effects of electric forces on dust lifting.

For the first time, this quantification of coupling will be used to understand when the two problems can be solved sequentially (i.e., design the artifact first, then its controller) so as to simplify the design process (i.e., disciplinary decoupling, and reduced product development times via parallel design) and when they need to be solved simultaneously (i.e., combined design of the artifact and its controller) to arrive at superior performance.  Again, for the first time, the quantification of this coupling will be used to investigate several important conjectures: (1) tightening performance specifications increases coupling; (2) controllability of the plant is related to coupling; (3) increased uncertainty increases coupling, and there exists a tri-lateral coupling between the artifact design, modeling and control problems.  The results of the research will be applied to compelling applications, such as fuel cell vehicles and MEMS.  The results of this research are expected to yield, not only a method for quantifying coupling between plant and controller design, but also to provide general methods and principles of design based upon the trade-off between convenience of decoupling versus best system performance achievable with a more complex co-design approach.  The synergistic integration of mechanical, electrical, electronic, computer, optical, and control disciplines what has become known as mechatronics characterizes the design of modern engineered systems.  Mature technologies, such as automobiles, are gradually yet radically changing through increased controls in powertrain (e.g., controls for idle speed, air/fuel ratio, spark timing, exhaust gas recirculation, valve timing, cylinder displacement and automatic transmissions), vehicle dynamics (e.g., anti-lock braking and traction control, cruise control, four wheel steering, active suspensions, drive-by-wire) and active safety (e.g., airbags, electronic stability control, headway control).  Effective and practical introduction of new energy technologies, such as fuel cells, depends critically on designs with proper control functions.  Applications of breakthrough technologies, such as MEMS and biotechnologies, to real products may not be possible without a harmonious integration of the design and control functions.  The term ""co-design"" (combined design) refers to the fact that the design of the ""plant"" (or ""controlled system"") in the controls jargon and of the ""controller"" must be done in a combined, integral manner. This project aims to provide an important theoretical foundation for such co-design: a quantification of the coupling between the design and control functionality based on optimizing the overall system performance. Successful results of this research will have widespread impact on the design of a variety of mechatronic systems (e.g., automotive controls, fuel cells, MEMS).",A. Galip Ulsoy|Panos Papalambros

This  study concentrates on the process that describes the reactant and water dynamics in a  proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. While computational fluid dynamic models  have been gainfully used to represent this process and aid in the design of fuel cell  systems, they are difficult to calibrate for large stacks and too complex for control design.  Any model-based control scheme used for water management must adequately trade-off  simplicity while still being able to predict the dynamic behavior of the vapor and liquid  phase transport, and consequently electrode flooding.

Savage   Institution:  University of Michigan  Proposal Number: 0625641  Title: Pharmaceutical and Commodity Chemical Synthesis in High-Temperature Water    Intellectual Merit:     High-temperature liquid water (HTW) is attractive as a reaction medium for organic chemical synthesis because it is inexpensive, abundant, non-toxic, renewable, environmentally benign, and has desirable chemical properties.  Several different commercially relevant syntheses have been demonstrated in HTW, but many more targets of opportunity exist.  Pharmaceutical reactions, for instance, are attractive targets because this sector of the chemical industry generally produces more waste per unit mass of product than any other sector.  After discussions with chemists at Pfizer, the PI has decided to explore three especially attractive chemical reactions in HTW.  These are a Friedel-Crafts reaction with ""green"" Lewis acids catalysts to synthesize tetralone, the deprotection of phenolic methyl ethers, and Suzuki coupling to make new C-C bonds. These three reactions are relevant to the manufacture of several different pharmaceutical products.      In addition to the research noted above that examines new chemistries in HTW, he will also revisit syntheses that have already been demonstrated in HTW.  These systems include the partial oxidation of p-xylene to make terephthalic acid (in collaboration with BP), aldol condensation, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation.  The purpose here is to improve these HTW syntheses so they might become economically competitive with current processes.  A limitation currently restraining implementation of HTW-based reaction technologies is that the solubilities of organic reactants are often too low to give volumetric production rates that can compete economically with existing processes.  A recent advance, however, has suggested a possible route for overcoming this barrier and increasing the productivity of HTW-based processes without sacrificing the environmental benefits.  This advance is the demonstration that solubility in water is not required to get fast reaction rates in water. In fact, for some reactions, heterogeneous aqueous-organic systems (vigorously stirred immiscible aqueous and organic phases) provided greatly accelerated reaction rates relative to the homogeneous conditions typically employed.  To date, this effect has only been demonstrated at near ambient temperatures.  The PI will explore whether it can be employed in HTW.    This project will examine the partial oxidation of p-xylene to make terephthalic acid, aldol condensation, Friedel-Crafts reactions, Suzuki coupling, and ether hydrolysis.  If successful, the research will lead to chemical reaction processes that are at least as productive as current ones, but are significantly more environmentally friendly.  Removing the current barrier of low reactant concentrations in HTW will allow these technological advances to occur.      Broad Impact:    The PI will work with the UM Technology Transfer Office to make available the technological advances.  The benefit of this work will extend to the chemical industry and the general public (by having less environmental risk associated with the manufacture of chemical products).  The project will also provide training for a graduate student and about six undergraduate students.  Additionally, the PI will continue his practice of incorporating his research results into the undergraduate and graduate classes he teaches at Michigan, so there will be benefits related to the integration of teaching and research.",Phillip Savage|

Under this methodology, two or more self-calibrated, outdoor wireless video cameras are initially placed at a project site and collect video-streams. Using the construction materials and shapes visual recognition methods that the investigator has previously developed, each project related entity on the cameras' field of view is identified as an ""interesting"" pattern to track. The pixel area that it occupies in each camera is marked. Based on each entity's area centroid and epipolar geometry, the corresponding entities on each camera's view are matched, to determine the 4D position of each entity. Established tracking techniques are then used in each subsequent frame of the video stream to track the movement of the identified ""interesting"" entity while it operates within the cameras' viewing spectrum.         Tracking of project related entities, such as materials, equipment and personnel, has been a significant topic of research for the last decade. Trackers, and especially automated trackers, are useful in progress monitoring and inventory control applications for construction sites, materials management, collision/accident prevention tools and security applications. Tracking records can also be used in activity sequence analysis for optimal path determination and processes redesign. Existing vision-based tracking technologies can be divided in model-based and user-driven approaches. The major advantage of model-based techniques is that they are highly efficient and precise in following the modeled targets. The limitation is their need for fairly elaborate entity models. Correspondingly, the major advantage of user-driven approaches is their wide-range applicability while their limitation is the lack of prior knowledge of the tracked entities' characteristics and the need for a user to select the ""interesting"" entities manually. Therefore, in a construction site where large numbers of different material types, personnel and equipment are involved, one would need to create elaborate models for each type of entity that needs to be tracked, or manually select each entity to be tracked every time that entity would enter a camera's view. These are the limitations that the proposed research addresses by automatically recognizing the related entities and directing a generic tracker to follow them accordingly. As a result, this research is expected to substantially increase the efficiency and quality of the information technology processes involved in civil infrastructure construction and in manufacturing. This in turn will result in cost and time savings, will improve the competitiveness of the U.S. construction industry, and will reduce life cycle costs of civil infrastructure.",Ioannis Brilakis|

At the same time, perimeter firewalls and NAT devices designed to protect networks are becoming porous to many of the threats they were designed to defend against. The end result has been a proliferation of undetected malicious activity inside network perimeters. To combat the rise of threats inside the network and the lack of visibility into sub-networks, this research seeks to construct a set of techniques for building a topologically-accurate map of unused and unreachable addresses (darknets) inside a network, and then using that map to deploy a pervasive detection system. The key insight that enables the approach is integration with routing, policy, and host management systems that already understand part of the address topology. This topology information will be used to construct a high-level map of address usage and then place darknet sensors at thousands of different locations inside the network to detect threats inside the network perimeter and threats outside trying to penetrate in. Using multi-dimensional data mining techniques we will then develop a framework for analyzing the huge volume of data produced by the detectors. In summary, this research effort introduces a novel approach to increase the visibility and effectiveness of Internet threat detection systems by developing methods to automatically discover network topology and use that knowledge to deploy pervasive network sensors that enable new detection capabilities",Farnam Jahanian|Jignesh Patel

This goal will be achieved by building and validating a set of linked models that account for producer and consumer behavioral responses to GHG reduction policies, and integrating these forecasted market responses into a novel framework for predictive life cycle and material flow analyses (LCA/MFA). Our major tasks will be: 1) to model vehicle design options and materials use for their costs and performance; 2) to evaluate the market penetration of these options by modeling their performance in the context of market-based and regulatory policy instruments, producer objectives, and consumer preferences; and, 3) to evaluate the consequences of market responses on global materials flows and life cycle emissions.   The proposed research exists at the interface between engineering design, applied economics, social research, public policy, and sustainable development. The scientific impact will derive from the formulation of techniques, methods, and models in each of these disciplines that will help us understand the relationships between technology policy, technology adoption, and unintended environmental and materials flows consequences.  Scientific impact will also arise from how these tasks are holistically integrated into an interdisciplinary meta-system.  The broader impact of this proposal will be derived in part from the construction of a computational environment that will allow analysts to optimize technology and policy decisions with respect to costs, market acceptance, materials flows, and environmental impacts.

Unique online tools and educational materials are being developed to support inquiry teaching in organismal biology based on a well-established and popular online natural history database, the Animal Diversity Web. Students using these materials are guided to searches and self-directed inquiries of natural history data in activities designed to illustrate core concepts in organismal biology and ecology. Project staff are working with talented instructors at seven institutions in the Great Lakes region to design activities that fit directly into a wide range of biology courses, including ecology, general biology, animal diversity, evolution, and behavior. These educational activities are being supported by an online, collaborative workspace that includes materials to guide faculty and students in the development of queries and tools to facilitate the analysis, synthesis, and presentation of results. The flexibility of these tools allows their use in a wide range of undergraduate educational settings. This project's online tools and workspaces are being designed to be freely available to instructors at all levels in any part of the country and are encouraging participants and other interested educators to share exercises and experiences. The online components are modular, not content-dependent, so other online digital resource sites can incorporate them into their own educational support efforts. The effectiveness of these inquiry activities is being evaluated through testing of modules by faculty experts, and through examination of student reactions to the activities, gains in content knowledge, and gains in their ability to reason from and use data to support claims.

In contrast to conventional assessments of mathematical knowledge (e.g., the SAT or Woodcock-Johnson assessment), these measures investigate the special mathematical knowledge teachers use to work in classrooms with students. One of the key outcomes of this work from the point of view of the NSF Math and Science Partnerships (MSP's) is the flexibility afforded by a library of more than 300 items ranging across the content areas of number concepts, operations, patterns, functions and algebra, and geometry, allowing project directors and evaluators to custom tailor assessment instruments to meet their specific needs and the content and effects of professional development efforts. This proposal seeks to fully exploit the extensive library of items developed as part of the LMT project and the psychometric information gathered using IRT as part of that effort through the creation of a web-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT) assessment. Computerized adaptive testing dynamically assesses subject performance in a particular domain by sequentially selecting items from the library in order to maximize the precision of measurement. After a subject has responded to a selected item, her/his scale score is updated, and a new item is chosen to match her/his updated scale score estimate. This process is then iterated until a specified level of precision is reached. The additional precision and reduction in testing time and effort afforded by computerized adaptive measures of teacher knowledge should enhance the ability of MSP project directors and evaluators to judge the efficacy of professional development aimed at improving teachers' content knowledge for teaching; and to estimate the effects of curriculum materials designed to improve teachers' knowledge of mathematics and students. These CAT measures will be accessible to users with limited technical expertise, comparable across a wide variety of programs and approaches to professional development, and will employ the most modern and technically up to date approaches for CAT assessments.",Stephen Schilling|

It is generally assumed that in Pangea, Gondwana's Northwest-African margin was adjacent to North America's Appalachian margin; this reconstruction is called Pangea-A. However, for times before the Late Triassic the available data from paleomagnetism derived from Gondwana and Laurasia do not agree well with the Pangea-A fit, which have led scientists to either question the validity of these data or to propose a different fit, called Pangea-B. The main problem with the Pangea-B reconstruction is that everyone agrees that by Late Triassic time, the fit was that of Pangea-A, which implies that Pangea-B transformed into Pangea-A in Permian or Triassic time. The relative movements to accomplish this change consist of a surprisingly large 3500-km or greater dextral mega-shear between Gondwana and Laurasia. For such a mega-shear, little geological evidence exists, and geologists have therefore ignored the Pangea-B proposal. Relevant Late Permian and Early Triassic paleomagnetic data have thus far remained of demonstrably inferior quality, and we intend, therefore, to collect new paleomagnetic data for this time interval to test Pangea fits, and to determine whether a change from Pangea-B to Pangea-A occurred before or after the Late Permian, if it did occur at all. The majority of the new collections will be from Argentina, where stratified volcanic rocks exist that will likely yield reliable results.     The supercontinent Pangea is a very fundamental and prominent aspect of the ancient geography of the Earth, and the accuracy of its configuration is of interest to anyone studying Earth Science. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is any evidence for a Pangea reconstruction in Late Permian-Early Triassic paleomagnetic data, in which northwestern South America was located adjacent to the Appalachian margin of North America. Such a Pangea-B reconstruction is rather different from the classically and widely accepted Pangea-A fit in which northwestern South America is, instead, adjacent to the Texas margin of North America. The available paleomagnetic records for Permian and Early Triassic time surprisingly seem to favor Pangea-B, which has puzzled geologists for decades. If Pangea B existed, then it must have undergone a large wrenching movement during either the Permian or the Triassic. This study intends to establish whether the previous, rather preliminary results that favor Pangea-B are supported by carefully determined new paleomagnetic data. If Pangea-B is found to have existed, the study will by inference have obtained evidence for enormous lateral fault movements, of the order of 3500 km in length or more, the likes of which are not documented for any time in the post-Pangea history of the Earth, that is, in the last 200 million years.",Rob Van der Voo|

These lessons include improved coordination of joint activity at a distance, more effective transfer of procedural knowledge across distributed sites, and accelerated practical application of research findings.  A key intellectual contribution of this project is demonstration of how to realize benefits of CI-based tools without special individual or organizational circumstances, such as dependence on CI-savvy individuals.      In terms of broader impacts, our project will expand use of ECC in civil infrastructure systems (e.g., bridges, tunnels, roadways, pipelines) with a corresponding decrease in the vulnerability of these systems due to deterioration through normal wear-and-tear or catastrophic events like earthquakes.  Additionally, our project will inspire and motivate researchers to organize more activity via cyberinfrastructure where barriers to participation are reduced.  For example, students are able to interact directly with leading reseachers via blog, chat and discussion tools that are included in Sakai.

Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, biophysical chemistry and materials chemistry.",Carol Fierke|Mark Banaszak Holl|Ayyalusamy Ramamoorthy|Adam Matzger|Melanie Sanford

Spatial and temporal patterns in microbial species and their roles in natural ecosystems are controlled by their dispersal attributes (e.g., whether by wind or water) and local growth conditions, but the relative importance of these factors is unknown. This research will characterize these two fundamental controls on the distribution of microbes in Arctic lakes, streams and soils, and will reveal how seasonal, annual and long-term shifts in the populations of microbial species relate to the rapid climatic changes that are occurring in this region.     The complex nature of microbial biodiversity is important for understanding human health and disease, and for understanding the consequences of our warming world. Bacteria and other microbes ultimately control the production of carbon dioxide and methane, potent greenhouse gasses, in all ecosystems. In the Arctic there are currently low but rapidly increasing temperatures, thawing permafrost, and much accumulated organic matter all creating a situation ripe for increased bacterial respiration (conversion of organic matter to carbon dioxide). These collective factors could greatly alter regional and global carbon budgets, and hence feedback to further climate changes.

Titanosauria is the most diverse (40+ species), long-lived, and widely distributed sauropod lineage, but its evolutionary relationships remain poorly understood. This study will survey the global diversity of titanosaur anatomy and bone microstructure to resolve questions of titanosaur evolution and life history, and development. Anatomical data we collect will allow construction of the first well-supported hypothesis of titanosaur genealogy. Bone microstructural data will allow examination of growth rates and developmental traits across a diverse range of titanosaurs, which include gigantic and dwarf forms. Synthesis of these data will allow assessment of body size evolution and life history traits within Titanosauria, which will be central to future examinations of the evolution of titanosaur feeding specializations, locomotion, and paleobiogeography.

This will be accomplished by studying the genetic changes that are responsible for differences in body color among fruit flies of the same and different species. The genes responsible for pigmentation differences between individuals will be identified, and then examined closely to figure out how they have changed to create flies with different colors and patterns of pigmentation.  A combination of genetic analysis (i.e. mating flies with different body colors), transgenic analysis (i.e. moving genes between individuals or species), and analysis of pigmentation in natural populations will be used to accomplish this goal.    Understanding how pigmentation evolves in fruit flies provides information about how the evolutionary process works in general. Genes specify the characteristics of all animals, and differences within genes can create differences between individuals. Because all genes follow the same rules, the types of genetic changes responsible for differences in fly pigmentation should also be responsible for the evolution of other traits, including those that differ between humans and chimpanzees.",Patricia Wittkopp|

Al-Hashimi both of the University of Michigan whose research will advance the area of protein design by engineering some of the novel properties of fluorocarbons into biological molecules. This will be achieved by synthesizing proteins that contain extensively fluorinated ('fluorous') analogs of hydrophobic amino acids in their hydrophobic cores. Fluorous amino acids are predicted to stabilize proteins against unfolding by heat and organic solvents and to facilitate protein: protein recognition through specific fluorocarbon-fluorocarbon interactions. Fluorinated versions of a dimeric RNA-binding protein, Rop, will be synthesized in which the hydrophobic core of Rop will be repacked with the fluorous analog of leucine, hexafluoroleucine. This protein is small enough (63 residues) to be efficiently synthesized by peptide synthesis, which will allow fluorous amino acids to be introduced site specifically. Rop protein has been extensively used as a model system for investigating protein stability and folding, and as a template for protein re-design. These data will serve as a useful reference for the present study. A variety of physical techniques (such as circular dichroism, microcalorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation) will be used to investigate the effect of fluorination on the biological activity, structure and stability of fluorous Rop proteins. An important innovation will be the use of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) NMR measurements to perform detailed comparisons of the effect of fluorination on the structure and conformational rigidity of the protein.

Leptin signals to the brain information about long term energy balance, and thus influences critical aspects of the life cycle such as growth and reproduction in many species. Additionally, the prevalence of obesity in developed countries in recent years has focused intense interest on leptin and other factors that influence appetite and energy metabolism.   Dr. Denver's lab reported the first definitive identification of the obese gene and the functional characterization of leptin in a nonmammalian species, the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Until now, virtually nothing was known about the biology of leptin outside of mammals. The overall goal of this research is to understand the functions of leptin in a cold blooded species, Xenopus laevis, whose lineage diverged from that of modern mammals over 200 million years ago. The frog has been, and continues to be an important model organism for the study of animal development. Using molecular, physiological and developmental approaches, the major questions to be addressed in this research are: 1) Does leptin play an evolutionarily conserved role in long term energy balance in frogs, and thereby influence critical aspects of the amphibian life history such as metamorphosis, growth and reproduction? 2) Where and when in the frog's body is leptin produced, and where are leptin's major sites of action? 3) Does leptin influence tadpole brain development, alter tadpole growth and the timing of metamorphosis?  This project, which will offer unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, will provide a foundation for understanding the functional evolution of this important vertebrate hormone, and establish the frog as a model system for the study of leptin actions in early development.

A future is envisioned in which large networks of increasingly autonomous embedded systems operate robustly and reliably. Increased levels of automation will require to on-line represent and process huge amounts of data for the design of control schemes that guarantee safety while maintaining performance. A bottleneck in advancement in this direction is complexity. Complexity is established by the natural scale of the system and by the interaction of the physical devices with logic-based control, which create a large number of system behaviors.  Current methods in the control synthesis in embedded and hybrid systems usually assume small system size and perfect state measurements. While in some cases such assumptions are satisfied, several realistic applications have large system size and imperfect or partial measurements.     To address these problems, this NSF CAREER project is developing a dynamic feedback approach (state estimation plus control) for the monitoring and recovery of multi-agent systems modeled as infinite state transition systems with logic and timed transitions. This approach relies on partial order theory as a key enabler to overcome computational difficulties arising from large system size and from the interaction of continuous evolution and logic. By exploiting partial order structures on the set of states and inputs, this method provides an efficient alternative to enumeration approaches and exhaustive searches, which are common practice in embedded programming.

The main goal of this project is to develop an essential understanding of the impact of large scales on the performance of wireless networks. In particular, the project examines how the finiteness of resources (memory, computational power, etc.) at individual nodes affects the overall network performance. The developed understanding is then used to design a set of algorithms that support efficient operation of large-scale networks of nodes with very limited resources. The algorithmic aspect is particularly important given that some of widely considered algorithms require excessive resources at individual nodes and, hence, are not scalable. However, the project demonstrates the existence of algorithms that require only negligible resources but achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that completely new protocols are needed to support operation of large-scales wireless networks.     In contrast to the majority of earlier studies that examined either large networks with unlimited node resources or small networks with limited node resources, the focus of this project is on relationship between the network size and node resources. Most of the considered problems are impractical to be addressed experimentally due to a considerable cost of building large-scale prototypes. Moreover, even simulating such systems is often very difficult because of computational limitations. Thus, a comprehensive research agenda is based on an analytical framework that overcomes the difficulties imposed by large scales.",Petar Momcilovic|

The objective of this CAREER project is to develop and apply novel NMR methods for characterizing RNA dynamics from picosecond-to-millisecond timescales. At the heart of these methods is a domain elongation strategy that provides a means for interpreting spin relaxation data and residual dipolar couplings in terms of site-specific dynamical parameters. These methods will be generalized to allow studies of larger RNAs and used to investigate the network of internal motional modes that drives conformational adaptation in the transactivation response element (TAR) RNA upon recognition of cognate targets. This will then be followed by dynamic studies of a larger (80 nt), more complex thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch RNA domain from E. coli mRNA which represents a new class of regulatory RNAs that regulate gene expression by switching conformation upon target recognition. These investigations will yield the first site-specific characterization of internal motions in RNA providing fundamental new insight into how structure and dynamics come together to create function. By deepening our understanding of the physical principles governing RNA functional dynamics, this research will also benefit applications seeking to rationally control RNA activity, including the design of RNA sensors. The methodology can easily be adapted to study dynamics in DNA molecules.     The main objective of the educational component is to foster greater awareness within the community about the excitement that surrounds scientific research and discovery. To this end, a one-day forum will be organized once a year at the University of Michigan that is open to the community and free of charge that presents and celebrates several major discoveries specifically as they pertain to the PI's research field of structural biology. From Linus Pauling's characterization of the chemical bond to the story surrounding the discovery of the DNA double helix, the forum will strive to explain in laymen's terms the intellectual strides that led to the discovery, and explore the human, historical, and cultural stories behind these achievements. The forum will include lectures followed by tours of state-of-the-art facilities used in biophysics research. The forum will be summarized in a pedagogical handbook which will be made available to the public via the internet. The forum is expected to enhance existing interactions between the Department of Chemistry and Biophysics Research Division at the University of Michigan and middle and high school students and teachers in the Ann Arbor and surrounding areas. In addition to one graduate student, this research project will be carried out by two undergraduate students currently in the PI's laboratory. This will help sustain a strong tradition of training undergraduate students in the PI's laboratory.

The implementation of PBEE requires both the fragility of structural systems and the probabilistically quantified seismic hazard to be known in order to establish the annual probability of specific losses due to seismic events. However, the probabilistic quantification of the seismic hazard is highly uncertain in regions where the return period of moderate-to-large earthquakes is significantly longer than the historic earthquake record, such as in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and the central/eastern United States (CEUS) -- we know moderate-to-large earthquakes occurred in these regions, we just do not know how large the events were or how often they occur. Paleoseismic techniques, particularly paleoliquefaction investigations (i.e., the study of liquefaction features from pre-instrumental earthquakes), are the most plausible way to extend the earthquake record into prehistoric times. Such techniques allow both the recurrence time and characteristics of moderate-to-large earthquakes to be established and, thus, remove a major impediment to implementing PBEE in these regions. The impact of the project will be the significant reduction of the seismic risk of newly designed and constructed standard and hazardous facilities. The project is particularly timely as the nation (as well as the world) renews their interest in the construction of nuclear power plants, which if to be realized safely requires proper quantification of seismic hazard. For regions of the US where the new plants are likely to be located (e.g., CEUS), reliable paleoseismic data are absolutely essential for assessing seismic hazard. In addition to graduate students from the University of Michigan (UM), undergraduate students from both UM and Valparaiso University will participate in a demonstration exercise in which a paleoseismic investigation of the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone will be performed. Also, as part of this project, the PI is initiating an outreach program for military veterans. The reason for establishing this outreach is that veterans tend to possess many of life's skills that will enable them to succeed in academics. The vast majority of enlisted veterans come from the lower socio-economic echelons in the US, and a large percentage of veterans are underrepresented minorities, as compared to the general population.",Russell Green|

University of Michigan Ann Arbor  Proposal Number: 0644648    CAREER: Development of Geostatistical Data Assimilation Tools for Water Quality Monitoring      In a time when anyone can check weather forecasts online to know whether they should plan a picnic for the upcoming weekend without the risk of rain, why is it not possible to log on to check whether the water at the local beach is expected to be free from e-coli on that same day? The development of water quality forecasting systems is essential to long-term sustainable water resource management. In anticipation of this goal, new tools are needed to merge water quality data in statistically rigorous manner while making optimal use of the information provided by the available measurements. Unlike weather monitoring and forecasting, water quality assessment will always suffer from a relative sparsity of data due to the difficulty and expense associated with data collection. As a result, a probabilistic framework is essential to the success of any water quality prediction framework, because the impact of the uncertainty associated with sampled water-quality related parameters needs to be taken into account throughout the analysis.  A significant gap in knowledge preventing the implementation of a probabilistic water quality forecasting framework is the lack of methods for assimilating the disparate types of data in a water quality monitoring network. If a data-driven statistical description of the distribution of water-quality-related parameters could be obtained, then this information, once coupled to numerical models of water flow, transport, and chemical and biological interactions, could form the basis of a water quality forecasting system. The assimilation of spatial data into numerical models brings about a number of statistical problems that fall naturally into the realm of geostatistics. The main research goal of this project is to develop the statistical and numerical tools needed to make optimal use of sparse and imperfect water quality monitoring data, by overcoming basic limitations associated with their analysis, such as physical constraints, support and scaling issues, uncertainty assessment, and computational issues. These research goals are closely connected with the educational plan and broader impacts of this project, which center on the broad dissemination of research results to a multidisciplinary audience, the development of innovative educational materials, and the strong emphasis on the recruitment and retention of women in science and engineering.  Intellectual merit: The research objectives of this project center on novel statistically rigorous tools for  making optimal use of limited water quality monitoring data, through innovative use of auxiliary information. our specific features typical of water quality data will be addressed. (1) Geostatistical Markov chain Monte Carlo geostatistical tools will be developed for incorporating known physical constraints and assessing their impact on water quality parameter distributions. (2) Available data often have different physical scales, making datasets incompatible with one another even if they are measuring the same quantity. This project will develop tools for geostatistical downscaling applicable to water quality and related data. (3) To deal with large volumes, types and sources of water quality data, a Kalman filtering and smoothing statistical framework will be built for sequentially updating estimates of water quality parameter distributions. (4) Tools for merging multiple data streams will be developed, building on results from the second and third objectives. Field data will be used to test and validate the individual tools developed as part of these first four objectives. (5) In the last phase of the project, the developed statistical tools will be applied concurrently to a pilot field study.",Anna Michalak|

Biological molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins have unique specificity in recognition. But fast and reliable detection of these diagnostically important biological molecules remains a significant challenge especially given the difficulty in devising an effective label-free and sensitive detection strategy. On the other hand, conjugated polymers (CPs) can respond very sensitively to a variety of environmental stimuli via changes to their physical properties, e.g. changes in color and fluorescent emission.  Earlier studies have expended signal amplifying property of synthetic CPs for high sensitivity in many molecular sensor designs. To develop highly sensitive and highly selective biosensors for these biomolecules, this award will devise bio-conjugated polymer hybrid materials where biological materials are the recognition receptor and CPs are the reporters generating a sensory signal. These studies will address the most important design principle to combine a biological receptor and a conjugated polymer so that a selective recognition event at the receptor site can produce a sensitive, amplified signal from the conjugated polymer reporter. The most valuable knowledge that would come out of these studies will be molecular design principles of conjugated polymers and bio-conjugation and an assembly/fabrication strategy for the development of self-signaling and signal amplifying biosensor arrays. The relationship between the chemical structure of a conjugated polymer and its assembly with biological receptors and their effects on sensor sensitivity and selectivity will be systematically investigated to reveal the necessary design principles. The design considerations of each component to allow for properties necessary to the molecular sensor will provide insight in molecular biosensor design.  The proposed studies will promote molecular-level understanding in students at various levels on the relationship between organic/polymeric molecular design and the properties of such materials through incorporating results from the proposed research into ongoing curriculum and outreach program development. The main components of the proposed research cover broad disciplines of science including molecular design, chemical synthesis, polymer synthesis, molecular self-assembly, device fabrication, and performance characterization. These multidisciplinary components will be integrated into a larger educational effort to (1) offer engineering students a solid foundation of molecular design principles, structure-property relationships, synthetic methodology, and the assembly of organic and polymeric materials, (2) promote engineering students' abilities to devise advanced novel soft materials and associated devices, (3) prepare engineering students to conduct multidisciplinary research involving materials and biology.

While the negative effects of climate variability already distress a large number of the poor around the world, it is expected that future changes in the climate regime will affect populations in the global south even more disproportionately. Although knowledge systems have been extensively theorized as a determinant of adaptive capacity, there has been relatively little empirical research specifically focusing on the role of knowledge in adapting to climate. What role has knowledge, in particular science generated knowledge (or technoscientific knowledge), played in past adaptations to climate stress? What role can it play to build adaptive capacity to future climate change? The study combines qualitative and quantitative methods to explore hypotheses both about patterns of knowledge use across river basin councils and about the role of technoscientific knowledge and governance in building adaptive capacity in these basins. This study aims to contribute to the literature on climate adaptation and human dimensions of global climate change as well as to social and economic planning for the mitigation of both destructive climate-related impact (drought, flooding) and social problems related to inequitable resource distribution, predatory water use and exclusionary decision-making processes.",Maria Carmen Lemos|

Globalization, with open flow of information, goods and people all over the world, brings benefits to all.  However, it also creates challenges for the nation. For example, in engineering education many countries now emulate the successful US engineering schools and curricula, and are producing an order of magnitude more engineers, of comparable quality, than the US. Global companies can employ such world-class engineering talent, often at 20-30% of the cost in the US, and are moving manufacturing, design and even research activities to such locations.  The economy and prosperity of the nation will depend on our ability to respond effectively to such a changing environment, especially in core engineering disciplines such as mechanical engineering.  The challenge is how to educate a mechanical engineer that provides five times the value-added when compared to the global competition, i.e., the ""5XME"".    The workshop will identify the attributes that mechanical engineering graduates will need to achieve the transformative goal of a ""5XME.""   The primary goal of the workshop and report is to provide recommendations to NSF/CMS, and other funding agencies, regarding needs and priorities for future investment in mechanical engineering research and education.

To answer this question, graduate student Laura Heineman, supervised by Dr. Marcia C. Inhorn,  will investigate the interaction of transplantation with the daily lives of adult transplant recipients and their caregivers.  This study focuses on three untested assumptions that: 1) transplantation, as a practice, is both founded upon and affecting cultural norms in the U.S.; 2) kin relations, cultivated in the home through activities of giving care, are a major component of transplantation's impact on daily life; 3) the arenas of constraint created by social stratification figure significantly in interactions between transplantation and human relatedness.  These assumptions will be explored at a major transplant center in the U.S. Midwest that employs a care model which focuses on the use of family and friends to meet patients' care needs both during and after hospitalization.      The researcher will employ a variety of ethnographic and social science research methods, including semistructured, unstructured, genealogical, and life history interviews; participant observation; fieldnote and visual documentation; and review of  health policy documents.  She	builds upon recent kinship theory, which examines multiple forms of relatedness beyond bio-genetic relations.  Comparisons will include: 1) patients and caregivers who are related by ""blood,"" marriage, or adoption, versus those who are ""kin-like,"" but not related in these ways (to understand what constitutes ""relatedness"") and 2) the experiences of transplantation in the hospital, versus those of transplant caregiving in the home (to ascertain the role of the home in kinship and transplant care).  These data will be evaluated in light of constraints faced throughout the transplant process.    The research is important because it  will be useful for  improving  health policy, outcomes for transplant patients (and others with serious, long-term illness),  support for caregivers, and communication between  medical professionals and patient populations.  At a time when alternative forms of relatedness are highly contested (e.g., same-sex marriage and family-making via new reproductive technologies), studies such as this are crucial to understand the mechanisms by which kin relations are created, solidified, questioned, or changed.  The research also will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist.",Gillian Feeley-Harnik|Laura Heinemann

The largest and longest running ANES data collection is a two-wave panel conducted in the months immediately before and after the 2008 elections.  The surveys are conducted face-to-face in the respondent's home and are part of a time-series that expands over 50 years.  Previous studies provide significant information on foreign policy (with an emphasis on terrorism in recent years), a range of feelings and perspectives about government (that could serve as a basis for understanding attitudes that are potentially related to domestic terrorism), and the relationship between religion and various aspects of social action.  The project augments the 2008 ANES by allowing the survey to ask more questions on both the pre-election and post-election interviews.  More broadly, these data collection enhances the ANES Time Series and provides a strong and credible basis from which to derive further understanding of issues such as preparedness, attitudes towards certain groups (particularly electorally relevant groups and religion), and further understandings of the likely roots of domestic terrorism and variations in domestic support for various homeland security initiatives..",Arthur Lupia|Jon Krosnick

Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability using low-energy nuclear reactions with short-lived beams such as 6He, 8Li, 7Be, 8B, etc.. These studies are a continuation of a very successful program to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier.  Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity of the continuum is one of the characteristic, defining features of weakly-bound systems.  The work will be carried out primarily with the TwinSol facility at the University of Notre Dame (UND), although the RNB facilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and (possibly) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory may also be utilized for specific experiments.  We also propose to make use of the nearly unique capabilities of the beams and experimental equipment available at UND to very accurately measure the (3He,n) reaction on Ge isotopes.  The data obtained from this experiment, when combined with the results from other experiments already underway at Yale University, will enable a much-improved value for the nuclear matrix element relevant for neutrinoless double  decay of 76Ge.  This in turn will allow for a more accurate determination of the mass of the neutrino.    The broader impact of the proposal on graduate, undergraduate, and high school education, as well as the development of a technologically literate workforce, is as follows.  The proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Michigan (UM) and the University of Notre Dame, together with faculty members and students from several other (primarily undergraduate) schools located in close proximity to UM and UND.  The ""hands-on"" training of these students in the use of advanced, state-of-the-art computational methods, nuclear accelerators, radiation detectors, vacuum and cryogenic techniques, and superconducting ion-optical magnetic systems has already had an important impact on the development of a technologically-literate workforce.  Finally, we will continue and expand a highly successful program that involves high-school students from the socio-economically-challenged New Buffalo, MI school district in physics-related research. This program has three components: the development of a nuclear-physics curriculum at NBHS that satisfies State of Michigan standards in this area, a yearly tour of the Notre Dame nuclear physics laboratory by all the physical-sciences students at NBHS, and a one-week residential ""nuclear physics summer camp"" for selected (and highly-motivated) NBHS students interested in learning about careers in physics.

First, with Mustata, he will investigate in detail a procedure by which one associates a convex body to a linear series on a projective variety. Introduced in passing by Okounkov, this construction has the potential to shed important new light on the structure of linear systems. A second set of problems involves using multiplier ideals and related tools from higher dimensional geometry to study some questions of an essentially local nature. Specifically, Lazarsfeld hopes to resolve some conjectures of De Fernex, Ein and Mustata relating algebraic invariants of an ideal, and to prove in all dimensions a result about attenuation of singularities of graded families of ideals suggested by a theorem of Favre-Jonsson concerning currents in the plane.     Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest and most central fields of mathematics, deals with the geometric study of the solutions of systems of polynomial equations. It touches on many other fields of mathematics, ranging from number theory to topology, algebra and complex analysis. It has found important applications to problems in such diverse areas as coding theory and theoretical physics. The particular questions that Lazarsfeld will study involve relating questions in algebraic geometry to geometric properties of solid bodies in space and to special collections of polynomials.

To mention just a few instances, they turn up in the following situations: as limits of smooth objects (spaces such as Riemannian manifolds, or smooth functions); as asymptotic ""spheres at infinity"" of finitely generated groups, objects that reflect the behavior of the groups at large scales; or in the fine-scale structure of sets, even in concrete and practical circumstances (irregular crystals, for instance, or other materials). The principal investigator studies questions that relate to singular objects and their geometry, and he does analysis on such objects. Specifically, he seeks to understand the extent to which the concepts of classical differential (first-order) analysis can be introduced into such spaces. For example, one would like to have a well-defined Sobolev space of weakly differentiable functions on certain singular spaces. It is also important to understand which potentially very singular spaces can be parametrized by ""nice"" spaces (say, by Euclidean spaces) via transformations that distort the basic metric structure only within fixed bounds. The principal investigator and his students are developing new tools for approaching this type of problem. Finally, the question of parametrization by a Euclidean space can be replaced with the requirement of embedability in some finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The methods that emerge from the project should clarify this problem as well.    The proposed research relates to applications in two ways. First, singularities (or impurities) occur everywhere in nature, from the local microstructure of materials to the large-scale features of the universe. Understanding and dealing with such singularities is one of the central objectives of modern mathematics and science. The principal investigator has made contributions to the solution of this problem in cases where the singularities can be analyzed and then transformed, with minimal cost, to better behaved models. Second, although not directly related to the project, there are potential applications of the research to theoretical computer science, where large and complex data sets need to be transformed and stored in simpler form.",Mario Bonk|

Their work has led to many interesting questions related to these spaces and also about some of the singular surfaces with small geometric invarients. Prasad proposes to work on these questions. He has also been working with Andrei Rapinchuk to find the extent a locally symmetric space of finite volume is determined by the set of lengths of its closed geodesics, or its spectrum. Their work led them to define a new relationship between ""large"" (Zariski-dense or arithmetic) subgroups which they call ""weak commensurability"". They have shown that weak commesurability of two arithmetic subgroups of a simple Lie group, whose Dynkin diagram does not have symmetries, implies that they are commensurable. They are now investigating the situation when the Dynkin diagram does have a symmetry. Prasad and Rapinchuk have used theorems in transcendental number theory, and a widely believed conjecture due to Schanual, to show that if the quotients of the symmetric space of an absolutely simple real Lie group by two arithmetic subgroups have same set of lengths of closed geodesics, or have the same spectrum, then the two arithmetic subgroups are weakly commensurable. So their results on weakly commensurable arithmetic subgroup can be used. Prasad proposes to obtain analogous results for locally symmetric spaces arising from comples semi-simple Lie groups. In a comepletely different direction, Prasad has associated a natural Levi-subgroup to a given irreducible admissible representation of a reductive p-adic group. He will investigate what role this subgroup plays in the representation theory.   Prasad has an ongoing collaboration with Rapinchuk to simplify, unify and complete the results on the congruence subgroup problem. They plan to write a book on this topic in near future.    Recent work of Prasad with Sai-Kee Yeung on certain interesting geometric objects known as arithmetic fake projective spaces has led to an explicit construction of all of them and helped to determine many of their geometric properties. Their work has also led to some important questions about related geometric objects. Prasad's recent work with Rapinchuk has deep implications for a particularly important class of geometric structures known as locally symmetric spaces.  These spaces arise from symmetric spaces, which as the name suggests, have a lot of symmetries. This work of Prasad and Rapinchuk has introduced a new notion of ""weak commensurability"" of large subgroups of the group of symmetries and studies its consequences in geometry and group theory.  There are still some serious unresolved questions on which they will work.  They also plan to write a book on the famous congruence subgroup problem to describe a new unified approach to settle it.",Gopal Prasad|

The problem of gaps between sums of two squares will be tackled in a new way,  which if successful could be developed into a major new tool for the study of  the coefficients of automorphic functions in short intervals.  Sieve methods  will be studied not by {it ad hoc} choices of sifting functions but rather by  allowing the sieve to reveal where its extremal configurations lie.  The goal is  to determine, in all dimensions, the optimal upper and lower bounds.  The local  distribution of zeros of the zeta function will be studied by locating optimal  kernels to use in conjunction with pair correlation information.     Statistics relating to the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions as  one averages over different arithmetic progressions will be determined.     For several decades, Hardy and Littlewood maintained a list of research  problems.  Among the problems remaining on their final list is to  derive a better upper bound for the gap between numbers that can be expressed  as a sum of two squares.  Here better means simply better than the trivial  bound one obtains by the greedy algorithm.  This problem is to be attacked  in a new way, and if the approach is successful, then the method may apply  in greater generality.  As was pointed out by Selberg, the problem of sieving efficiently is  fundamentally a problem of linear programming.  Existing sieves are  somewhat ad hoc, and in most cases the bound obtained is either not  optimal or at least not known to be optimal.  It is proposed to  emphasize the linear programming aspect of the problem, and to identify  extremals, for both the primal and the dual problems.  This is to be  done first in the simplest of situations, and then in successively more  challenging ones, so that eventually one will be able to identify  extremals in realistic problems of great interest.",Hugh Montgomery|

In addition to applying set-theoretic ideas to this branch of algebra, he is looking for new set-theoretic concepts and results motivated by algebraic problems.  He is exploring the connection between universal algebra (in Lawvere's category-theoretic formulation), the theory of classifying topoi, and the theory of unification (which plays a prominent role in some areas of computer science).  The connection is already understood in the case of absolutely free algebras, but further exploration is needed in the more general case of algebras subject to nontrivial identities.  Unification in the presence of identities is in general a troublesome topic, and it is hoped that the connection with other, better understood areas can clarify it.  The proposer is also studying a topos-theoretic approach to extending the notion of Borel functions to higher types.  Such an extension is useful for the theory of cardinal characteristics of the continuum.  Borel functions at the base type (real numbers) already play a major role in this theory, but so does an operation of sequential composition that necessarily leads to higher types.  The proposer is also studying several questions at the border between constructive logic, category theory, and game semantics.  This research includes an attempt to amplify the connection between games and free (or co-free) bicomplete categories, axiomatization of game-semantical validity, and a game-theoretic principle that may be fruitfully added to intuitionistic logic.  Finally, the proposer is studying several questions in set theory, most of which are connected with ultrafilters and in particular with the equivalence relation of near coherence on ultrafilters.  There are also some questions in infinite combinatorics growing out of considerations in abelian group theory.   	The project builds on the proposer's past experience in several areas of mathematics --- set theory, category theory (especially topos theory), abelian group theory, game semantics, constructive mathematics, and computer science --- in order to address problems bridging these areas.  Almost all of the topics in the proposal connect two or more of these areas.  In each case, it is reasonable to expect that ideas and styles of reasoning from one area can benefit other areas.  Among the potential outcomes of this research are: (1) a better understanding of unification, which is an essential ingredient of logic programming, (2) a clearer view of constructive mathematical reasoning as based on strategies in certain sorts of debates, and (3) applications of a context that resembles traditional set theory in many ways yet avoids the phenomena sometimes regarded as pathological.",Andreas Blass|

A major technological hurdle to global energy sustainability is the replacement of environmentally harmful and rapidly depleting energy sources with ecologically responsible and renewable sources.  Solar power is one promising avenue to clean energy; however, the relative efficiency, availability, or cost of solar power as compared to polluting power sources such as fossil fuels can preclude its widespread application. In terms of efficiency of solar cells and solar concentrators, the majority of energy (up to 95%) is converted to waste heat. The pairing of thermoelectric devices with solar cells and/or solar concentrators is a promising route to recovery of otherwise wasted energy. To this end, this project involves study of nanostructured materials for efficient conversion of both light and heat from the sun to electricity, as well as the development of a thin-film layer transfer technique to reduce materials cost.  Thus, if successful, the ion-cut-synthesis approach would enable efficient conversion of both heat and light to electricity, providing a possible solution to the challenge of cost-efficient energy sustainability.",Rachel Goldman|Michael Thouless|Katsuyo Thornton

The impetus for this research draws largely from the elegant simplicity with which designs in nature exhibit complex three-dimensional motion through continuous deformation. The research will result in a systematic method to create conceptual designs of compliant mechanisms by combining elemental building blocks which are derived from flexible biological systems. A six-dimensional hyper-geometry will be used to capture the essential motion properties for the characterization of a building block library. This mathematical framework will enable identification of the members of the building block library from nature, quantitative comparison between motion requirements and the building block characteristics, and systematic decomposition of the design synthesis task. Various biological mechanisms and engineered systems will be explored to deduce potential building blocks. Additionally, the six-dimensional hyper-geometry will be used to facilitate the intelligent decomposition of a larger design synthesis task into more tractable sub-tasks which may be addressed by elements of the building block library.     If successful, the results of this research will enable the practical realization of compliant systems in three dimensions. This has potential to greatly broaden the scope of applications where the benefits of compliance may be exploited. Furthermore, the potential benefits of the research to the broader engineering community are grounded in an intuitive approach which builds designer insight. The results of this research will be accessible to the broader engineering community in the form of software-based design tools to aid in visualization and automation of tasks, web-based learning modules, and a ""wiki""-like encyclopedia to aid in compliant mechanism design.",Sridhar Kota|

A novel idea to apply the FSP for addition or building of material will also be investigated.  Experimental analysis will enable better understanding of the bulk- and alloy material mixing and flow in the friction stir zone.  The intelligent spindle with temperature and force sensing capability will be adopted in this research.  Using advanced in-process monitoring and control of temperature and force can optimize the SFW process.    If successful, this research can lead to three additional broad impacts of FSP.  First is the friction stir repair of cracks.  Current friction stir welding leaves a hole of the tool tip shape after retracting from the surface.  Using the material additive process, the hole can be filled and components with cracks can be repaired, possibly on-site.  Second, this process can potentially lead to FSP-based rapid prototyping to build functional part from simple geometry.

Lithography for micro- and nanofabrication is of utmost importance for exploiting such structures as well as their new applications. Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) has emerged as a very promising technique over the past decade for nanostructure fabrication. On the other hand, the current process and throughput in NIL is still far from meeting demands of practical applications in many areas. Commercially relevant applications in the areas of biochips, data storage, and flat panel display mostly require much higher process throughput to justify the cost and manufacturing requirement associated with entering the nano"" regime. High-speed imprinting based on the original nanoimprint schemes have fundamental limitations from a material and process point of view. It is the objective of this proposed research to address the bottleneck in nanofabrication by developing continuous Roll-to-Roll NanoImprinting Lithography (R2RNIL) technology. The R2RNIL technique inherits the high-resolution feature of the traditional NIL process because it is also based on a mechanical embossing approach, but with a speed increased by more than an order of magnitude for nanopatterning. To demonstrate its potential impact to the nanomanufacturing society, we propose to apply the R2RNIL technique to a few testbeds related to organic electronic and nanophotonics, where it is commonly accepted that R2R technology is essential for the manufacturing of these devices for large area and low cost applications.  Integrating research into education is another major effort of this program. The project requires a multidisciplinary approach, and will involve student researchers at all levels, including undergraduate students. The PI will encourage and promote students' participation in interdisciplinary researches, and will involve graduate students both in Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Macromolecular Science and Engineering in this research project. The prototype equipment that will be constructed for this project will not only facilitate our research activities, but will also serves as a valuable demonstration tool in teaching this and related topics in classroom. Progress and new findings made in the project will be made available on website for dissemination to the general scientific community. By providing a truly simple, low-cost and high-throughput nanolithography technique to the broader scientific community, it will not only help to rapidly proliferate the knowledge gained from these new development, but also through the interaction with researchers from diverse fields we will be able to identify many new important applications that can be enabled by such a technology.",Lingjie Guo|

Hayes, University of Michigan  PI Institution: University of Michigan    Abstract:   Current trends in the microelectronics industry are making integrated circuits highly vulnerable to failures whose occurrence is inherently uncertain or non-deterministic.  This uncertainty is due to the shrinking of circuit components like logic gates into the nanometer range, where they become susceptible to tiny but random manufacturing defects, transient (soft) errors caused by radiation strikes, and quantum-mechanical effects. In circuits embedded in safety-critical applications such as vehicle control, the consequences of such uncertainty can be catastrophic. Most conventional methods of circuit analysis are deterministic, and cannot deal efficiently with problems of the above type. This project seeks a fundamental understanding of uncertainty and its role in logic circuit design and operation. It is pursuing a unified approach to analyzing, designing and testing circuits in the presence of non-deterministic behavior.  It will apply and extend several powerful concepts, methods, and software tools developed in our group, such as the QuIDDPro simulator program for quantum circuits. Three major issues will be addressed: (i) development of logic models to represent non-deterministic faults and errors, (ii) circuit synthesis (hardening) methods to achieve specified levels of error tolerance, and (iii) algorithms for simulating and testing circuits in the presence of uncertain behavior. The results obtained should be of direct interest to circuit designers and design tool developers in the U.S. microelectronics industry and in the nascent nanotechnology field.",John Hayes|

In these locations, the impact of  globalization on national policies and economies has allowed many people to enjoy new options in  their education, employment, saving and spending patterns, marriage, and other life decisions. For  people living in rural areas, migration is essential to accessing the opportunities available in urban  areas. Rural families are affected even more deeply as millions of young women migrate from  villages to work and live in urban areas.  This rural-to-urban migration is changing the roles of women in the family, and affecting the agency of young women in traditional family decision-making processes. Although researchers have  attempted to understand how migration is changing the roles of young women in developing  countries, a review of the literature indicates that researchers have thus far made reflexive, untested  assumptions about changes in women's roles in the family and women's agency in family decision-making.  This study  will be the first to directly examine the early migration decision-making process.  Using China as a case study, this dissertation will address this gap by collecting 141  in-depth qualitative interviews to explore two issues in migration; as a decision made in the family  and carried out by daughters; and as a process that affects young women's agency in negotiating  with the family in the decision-making process. These issues are explored by focusing on three  research questions: (1) how is the migration decision shaped by expectations in women's families;  (2) how do unmarried daughters perceive their ability, limitations, and likelihood of meeting those  expectations; and (3) how do daughters express agency in family decision-making prior to and after  their first migration for urban employment.  The co-PI will conduct Interviews with 150 young women and other family members in four cities in Liaoning Province (Shenyang, Dalian, Jinzhou, and Chaoyang).    The knowledge gained from this study has broader impacts for the social sciences.  First, it will facilitate the development of theories and hypotheses for quantitative analyses of migration and its linkages to women's agency.  Second, findings can inform the development of survey instruments and quantitative measures that gauge (1) the role of the family in migration decisions and processes, (2) the expressed agency by young women from rural areas as impacted by migration experiences, and (3) the dynamics of negotiation and expectations about the rights and obligations of young women in their families in rural settings. Further, the project will inform the development of policies aimed at increasing women's agency and social power.",Pamela Smock|

As part of this French activity in a  rapidly-developing area of geometric analysis, an International  Conference on Ricci Flow is scheduled for June 30-July 4, 2008 as  a conclusion to the trimester.  Topics of the trimester and  conference are expected to include Ricci flow in the  geometrization of three-manifolds, Kaehler-Einstein metrics and  Kaehler-Ricci flow, metrics of constant scalar curvature, Ricci  flow in dimensions four and higher, analytic aspects of geometric  flows, Einstein metrics and recent developments in geometric  relativity, synthetic Ricci curvature, and Ricci limit spaces.  This landscape was transformed by Perelman's work on Ricci flow  in three-manifolds and all of these areas have enjoyed recent  advances.      This award provides partial support for expenses of US-based  participants in the Paris conference, particularly graduate  students and junior researchers.  The subject of the workshop is  the Ricci flow and its extensions.  This differential equation  and technique in geometry became celebrated with its application  by Perelman and Hamilton to the Poincare Conjecture on the  topological uniqueness of the three-dimensional sphere, one of  the great challenge problems of mathematics.  The technique  considers a single space with a large number of metrics (ways to  measure distance in the space) by using the Ricci curvature at  each metric to determine a direction for evolving the metric that  is likely to make the metric more symmetric -- loosely speaking,  we try to change in the direction of ever rounder metrics.  Although it is often difficult to control all the details  necessary to make such an argument succeed, geometers have found  that this idea identifies optimal metrics in a variety of  important situations.

A principal goal of solid state physics and materials science is to elucidate this emergence.  A full achievement of this goal would imply the ability to engineer a material that is optimum for any particular application.  The mainstay of the current understanding of electrons in solids is a set of deep ideas known as the ""Fermi liquid theory.""  This theory explains why electrons in solids can often be described in a simplified picture which appears to ignore the large repulsive forces that electrons are known to exert on one another.  There is a growing appreciation that this theory probably fails for entire classes of possibly useful materials and there is the suspicion that the failure has to do with unresolved competition between different possible emergent behaviors.  This research grant supports an experimental program aimed at using a technique called electron spectroscopy to measure and quantify the underlying quantum mechanical behaviors of electrons in materials which manifest this unresolved competition because their crystal structures are quasi-one or quasi-two dimensional.  If successful the work will pinpoint essential ideas that must be combined to take the goal of engineering materials to the next level of sophistication.  The experiments are performed both in a home laboratory at the University of Michigan, and at various national and international synchrotron facilities.  The program relies on strong collaborations with other groups around the world for the providing of well characterized samples to measure, for determining electrical, thermal and magnetic properties of new materials, and for expert theoretical advice and advanced calculations.  It thus builds human bridges across geographic, institutional and disciplinary boundaries.

Thereby it contributes to our country?s human scientific resources.  Program personnel are also encouraged to seek opportunities to explain their work to the public in settings such as public lectures or science cafes.        *****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****    Strongly correlated electron materials manifest emergent phenomena by the remarkable range of quantum ground states that they display, e.g., insulating, metallic, magnetic, superconducting, with apparently trivial, or modest changes in chemical composition, temperature or pressure.  Of great recent interest are the behaviors of a system poised between two stable zero temperature ground states, i.e. at a quantum critical point.  These behaviors intrinsically support non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phenomena, including the electron fractionalization that is characteristic of thwarted ordering in a one-dimensional interacting electron gas.  This research program uses the techniques of photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopies to measure the single-particle electronic structures of selected low dimensional materials and seeks to identify emergent quantum structures and their relation to the underlying electronic structure.  If fully successful, the work could provide a sharp answer to the question of whether or not there are new quantum states of matter associated with the stabilization in higher than one dimension of properties associated with purely one dimensional theory models.  The experiments are performed both in a home laboratory at the University of Michigan, and at various national and international synchrotron facilities.  The experimental data are analyzed by comparison to theories which treat the Coulomb interactions in different ways, and which provide a link between the spectra and the electrical or magnetic properties.  The program relies on strong collaborations with other groups around the world for the providing of well characterized samples to measure, for determining electrical, thermal and magnetic properties of new materials, and for expert theoretical advice and advanced calculations.

There are two main parts to the project. The first focuses on several complex variables, the second on complex dynamics. However, the line between these two areas is not clear-cut. Within the several complex variables portion, the central concept is the Cauchy-Riemann equation. The problems are concerned with either deriving estimates for this equation, or improving understanding of key concepts basic to it, or applying estimates for this equation to function theory. The second part of the project deals with complex dynamics. Its objective is to obtain an understanding of foliations by Riemann surfaces. These arise naturally from flows of holomorphic vector fields and lead to basic questions about currents. (The latter could just as well be thought of as belonging to several complex variables.) The principal investigator has a long-standing collaboration with Sibony in which the two develop the theory of complex dynamics. Most recently they have carried out some investigations of Riemann surface laminations. These occur in the iteration of a holomorphic map, in that its associated Julia set might have a lamination along which the map is more regular than it is in other directions. (Of course, laminations are also an interesting topic in their own right.) Until now it has been necessary for the study to impose extra conditions, such as hyperbolicity, on the singular points. The plan is to continue the study while allowing for more general singularities and to search for ergodic properties of the laminations. In two dimensions, positive closed currents can be approximated by currents of integration of Riemann surfaces. It would be useful for the study of dynamics in higher dimensions to have a similar geometric interpretation of currents. The PI and Sibony propose to work on this topic with Coman. The case of immediate interest is that of currents in three dimensions of bidimension (1,1).    Mathematical analysis is an important tool for studying the world from a quantitative perspective. But already when one tries to find roots of polynomial equations, it becomes clear that complex numbers and complex analysis are needed. Hence it is important to develop complex analysis, which can then be used to build up other areas of mathematics (e.g., algebraic geometry, number theory). This project explores various aspects of complex analysis. The plan is for the principal investigator to work with two senior mathematicians, Diederich and Sibony. Together the three have a good overview of the fields of several complex variables and complex dynamics, which benefits not only their joint projects but also their work with younger mathematicians. They will work with two midcareer mathematicians (Coman and Lanzani) and with a group of postdocs (Heier, Herbig, Lee, Sahutoglu, Siano, and Wold).

The research will be done in the context of a particular application--patient scheduling for medical clinics and it will involve a Michigan clinic that works with patients with traumatic brain injury. This application context has three characteristics that make it challenging. First, it is dynamic, in that events, such as patient appointments, as well as constraints on the times of the events change over time. Second, it involves both hard constraints (e.g., that no appointments can be scheduled earlier than a given time), as well as so-called ""soft"" constraints that represent preferences over alternative schedules (e.g., that a particular patient prefers afternoon appointments, or that it is better not to have large gaps between the appointments a patient has on a given day). Third, it is interactive: a human being is responsible for specifying events, constraints, and preferences.    To create an effective scheduler, we will extend a well-studied class of constraint-satisfaction systems: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers. A key goal of this project is to enable SMT solvers to perform optimization efficiently and to develop algorithms for solving sequences of problems in a way that minimizes change across solutions while still producing near-optimal results. The project will also develop interfaces that make it possible for lay users to describe richly expressive constraints and preferences on schedules.    The broader impact of the work includes the potential usefulness of the techniques to key applications including clinic scheduling; the exposure of graduate students to contextual research; and the development of real-world problem sets for undergraduate courses.",Martha Pollack|Karem Sakallah

The two core areas of investigation are: (A) Estimation of functions under shape restrictions, and (B) Estimation of an appropriate ``threshold'' in the domain of a function where sharp and potentially substantial changes occur. Part of the emphasis in shape--restricted inference will be on maximum likelihood/least squares based procedures and in particular, the construction of confidence sets for quantities of interest (like a regression function, a hazard function etc.) by inversion of residual sum of squares or likelihood ratio statistics. This is in light of initial exploration for monotone function models where such statistics are seen to exhibit asymptotically pivotal behavior, which facilitates inference, since nuisance parameters need not be estimated from the data. Shape constraints of interest are monotonicity, unimodality and convexity/concavity, and often a combination of such features. Smoothing under shape constraints will also be investigated in some of these problems, since smoothing typically yields faster rates of convergence and provides automatic estimation of derivatives of functions, which are often of interest, for example in economics. On the threshold estimation front, two main areas will be explored. The first is change--point estimation, where there is a jump in the value of the function of interest or in the value of the derivative, with the focus being on design issues: how to design the sampling mechanism, given a fixed budget (of points that can be sampled) so as to entail precise detection of the jump. The second area concerns studying appropriate notions of a threshold for smooth functions that show rapid change over a short domain. One such notion can be formulated in terms of a function with a finite number of discontinuities that is used simply as an approximation, or a working model for the true function. The discontinuities of the best fitting working model provide a natural description of a threshold. Split--point estimation, as this is known, turns out to be radically different from change point estimation, in light of some initial work and will be investigated in more detail.    The proposed research will have diverse applications, ranging from disciplines in public health like biomedical studies and epidemiology to topics in the social sciences (economics) and the physical sciences (astronomy). Shape restrictions, for example, show up naturally in the analysis of productions of firms/companies (economics), the study of the risk of succumbing to illness or infection with age (biomedical research/public health), and problems associated with the detection of dark matter in galaxies, solutions to which can shed light on the future evolution of the universe (astrophysics). The P.I. is actively involved in collaborations with econometricians, epidemologists and astronomers: the research emanating from this grant will therefore have strong interdisciplinary flavor and will address many real scientific questions of interest.  On the threshold estimation front, statistical methods for split point detection are of importance, since split points have been used as a measure of threshold by ecologists in the development of pollution control standards. The problems related to change point detection will be applied to detection of stress thresholds in engineering systems. The statistical methodology to be developed will be circulated to the statistical community in academia and industry through free software packages. On the educational front, some of the research material in this proposal will be incorporated in advanced courses at the graduate level and an interdisciplinary seminar series.

However, there turn out to be many practical applications where, rather than the parameters being sparse, certain predefined functions of the parameters are sparse. This is referred to as Generalized Variable Selection (GVS). Specifically, the investigators study four important applications of GVS in areas as diverse as functional regression, principal component analysis (both standard and functional), multivariate non-parametric regression, and transcription regulation network problems for microarray experiments.    The investigators have direct connections in many fields outside statistics such as Biology, Finance, Manufacturing, Marketing, Medicine and Physics. The investigators believe that statisticians can, and should, make important contributions in all these areas. With the advent of new technologies, such as bar code scanners and microarrays etc., enormous data sets are becoming increasingly common in these and many other fields. Such vast quantities of data have made it important to develop statistical methodologies that can produce sparse and interpretable solutions. The investigators aim to systematically develop software to implement the proposed methods through free software packages, like R, and then make them readily available and publicize them in all these fields. The investigators believe that, because of the interpretive power of their proposed methods, once the software is available, it will be widely utilized.",Ji Zhu|

Particular problems studied are: extension of the Evans function technique for detection of unstable eigenvalues to three-dimensional and non-local problems in Bose-Einstein condensates; stability of nonlinear waves in strongly coupled Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations in a regime when local perturbation techniques fail; and application of Krein signature and Pontryagin spaces to the theory of integrable systems, particularly the study of spectral problems originated in the inverse scattering theory associated with the nonlinear Schrodinger and the Sine-Gordon equations.    Mathematical analysis of existence and stability of nonlinear waves in mathematical models in nonlinear optics, condensed matter physics, or chemical processes in human brain, has far-reaching consequences for applications as analytical results often guide future experiments in physics, chemistry, or medicine. A typical feature which distinguishes the field of nonlinear waves from many other fields of pure mathematics is a case study, many problems demonstrate very similar features but they do not rely on any common theory. In the recent years a particular theme appeared recurrently in two close fields - nonlinear waves and integrable systems. It is useful to consider a problem in a space which allows existence of states with 'negative' energy. These states then may lead to instabilities of coherent structures. For stable structures these negative energy states must be either not active or completely eliminated. The aim of the project is to gain more insight into this topic by solving interesting particular applied problems and apply it to build and simplify the general theory.",Richard Kollar|

It is based on the premise that the use of contextual information from applications that help users to coordinate or communicate with others - such as their calendar, messaging contacts, and address books - can help in creating privacy policies for location-aware systems. In contrast to earlier work on privacy that focused on such location-independent applications as Web services, the focus in this project is primarily on privacy in location-aware systems where users carry devices that help determine their location. These include GPS-enabled cell phones, wireless PDAs, and laptops. This work will leverage a location-aware infrastructure called Whereabouts, which is deployed in the new Computer Science and Engineering building of the University of Michigan.    This research integrates three key concepts to simplify privacy policy specifications: (1) Privacy meta-policies: These are high-level rules that help map a user's context information. For example, a rule may make the user's location available to meeting participants near the start time of a scheduled meeting. (2) Privacy circles: These structures help users share privacy meta-policies with other users. The research will evaluate the hypothesis that privacy meta-policies will be much easier to share than low-level policy preferences that are typically available in existing privacy systems for ubiquitous computing. (3) Privacy mirrors: These are tools to help users understand the impact of their privacy meta-policies. In particular, a user can use a privacy mirror to see how a set of meta-policies would have revealed their location to other users for past events or scheduled future events.    The success of this work will help users coordinate and collaborate better with each other using location information, while safeguarding privacy. This is important, because location-aware computing infrastructures are starting to become widely available, but they have still not penetrated mainstream use. Better calendaring and coordination tools will also result from this research, and it will help push the frontiers on understanding how people can better manage their privacy in the context of location-aware systems.",Mark Ackerman|Atul Prakash

The conference aims to develop a  comprehensive overview of the present status and future  directions of geometric analysis and its connections to many  areas including algebraic geometry, analysis, topology,  mathematical physics, and string theory.    The occasion for this large conference on geometric analysis and  related geometric subjects is the sixtieth birthday of Shing-Tung  Yau, one of the leaders in the area.  Geometric analysis is a  marriage of geometric problems and ideas, which often concern  properties of geometric spaces on large scales, with analytic  techniques that begin with small-scale features of geometry and  sometimes allow us to extrapolate those to large-scale  statements.  Two of the great successes of geometric analysis are  the Calabi Conjecture, settled by Yau in the 1970s and later  found to be a key to the development of string theory, and the  Poincare Conjecture, a celebrated problem that was open for more  than one hundred years before its resolution just a few years ago  by G. Perelman, who brought to maturity a program launched in the  1980s by R. Hamilton.  Many of the results and techniques  developed over the last thirty years in geometric analysis and  differential geometry were essential to the proof of the Poincare  Conjecture, and the ideas contributed to the problem by Perelman  have set off worldwide activity on new questions in geometric  analysis.

As a special example, the semiparametric accelerated failure time model that transforms the failure time by logarithm has been studied extensively in the past decade. Existing challenges for those semiparametric linear transformation models include semiparametric efficient estimation, asymptotic theory with more realistic conditions that may lead to good properties for survival time prediction, a measurability issue in the stochastic integral formulation for the outcome-dependent weighted estimating methods, and high-dimensional data analysis. The investigator proposes new methods to tackle those emerging issues in the semiparametric linear transformation models. Asymptotic theories will be proved by using the modern empirical process theory. Numerical implementations of all the proposed methods will be based on either those well developed algorithms for discrete estimating functions or the Newton-Raphson method for smooth objective functions in which the infinite-dimensional parameter is approximated by a smoothing estimator. To enhance the predicting ability, more flexible transformations are considered for problems with high-dimensional data. Penalized method will be investigated in order to obtain simultaneous variable selection and survival time prediction.      Statistical models considered in this project have important applications in a wide spectrum of disciplines such as biology, medicine, health studies, and engineering. The proposed research is particularly motivated by the multi-cohort study for the women's reproductive life staging in which the prediction of age at menopause is of major interest, and by the Michigan ovary cancer and lung cancer studies that look for relevant genes and good models for predicting patients' survival using gene expression data. It will provide methods that use data more efficiently and yield more precise prediction. It will also allow the investigator to add more thorough statistical results to the courses of advanced survival analysis and semiparametric models for graduate students. The proposed research activities will motivate graduate students to become independent researchers who are able to engage in fundamental statistical research.",Bin Nan|

The proposed research derives correction terms to improve the accuracy of these Brownian approximations in various settings.  The hybrid bootstrap is a new resampling method used to set confidence intervals. It is particularly relevant and appropriate when an experiment provides limited information about the parameter of interest, but substantial information about nuisance parameters.  Three applications are considered: estimating the signal in a signal plus noise Poisson model of interest in high energy physics; estimating the location of a quantitative trait loci on a strand of DNA with data from a back-cross or inter-cross design; and estimating new parameters after sequential change point detection.    Two different topics are considered for this project. The first concerns Brownian approximations. The specific goal is to derive correction terms to improve these approximations for a class of boundary crossing problems in discrete time. Brownian and diffusion approximations have been a major tool in stochastic modeling, with applications to diverse areas including sequential analysis in statistics, queuing theory for industrial and networking applications, and options pricing in finance. New methods to improve the accuracy these approximations should have broad value. The other topic concerns the hybrid bootstrap approach to interval estimation.  Bootstrap methods in statistics use computer simulation to help a researcher assess the precision of an estimator. Hybrid bootstrapping is a modern variant of this approach which is particularly relevant in situations where the experiment provides limited information about the parameter of interest.  Three specific applications are being studied. The first concerns experiments in physics in which a new particle or phenomenon, if present, will increase the rate of events, counted in the course of the experiment. A second application concerns modern genetics, trying to estimate locations for loci on a strand of DNA associated with a quantitative trait of interest. The final application arises in situations where a process of interest is monitored to detect changes. Industrial processes are often tracked since changes are often associated with production problems that should be noted and fixed as soon as possible to improve quality and output. Networks are often monitored for similar reasons, and financial series may be monitored for a variety of reasons. The hybrid bootstrap should be useful for new parameters describing process evolution after the change point.",Robert Keener|

Many of the classical results for case-control analysis, which assume the covariate distribution to be non-parametric, do not hold under a constrained space of exposure distributions. However, the gain in efficiency of modern retrospective methods comes at the cost of lack of robustness, since large biases are introduced in the retrospective estimates under violation of the gene-environment independence assumption. The main goal of this research proposal is to find natural analytical tools to solve the model specification dilemma of modern retrospective analysis of studies of gene-environment interaction, under some commonly used epidemiological designs. Using the profile-likelihood framework developed by Chatterjee and Carroll (2005, Biometrika), the investigator proposes a Bayesian approach that incorporates uncertainty regarding the assumed constraint of gene-environment independence in a natural data adaptive way. The proposed shrinkage estimator, conceived from a Bayesian standpoint, is designed to maintain attractive efficiency properties, without relying on unverifiable model constraints. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are studied under varying scenarios of gene-environment association. The investigator considers both empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes methods to relax gene-environment independence assumption. The proposal explores the connection of the Bayesian approaches to an alternative random-effects model. The methods are extended beyond the commonly used unmatched case-control study design to two-phase and family-based studies of gene-environment interaction.    Two scientific streams are currently playing extremely important roles in clinical medicine and public health: the molecular biology approach with an emphasis on genetics, and the quantitative approach with an   emphasis on epidemiology. The developments in these areas jointly are making fundamental contributions to the study of etiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of complex diseases.  Phenomenal advancement of   medical science and genetic technology is giving rise to many complex design and analysis issues which statisticians and epidemiologists have never confronted before.  This proposal lies in that new interface of human genetics, epidemiology and statistics. Case-control studies are being increasingly used for studying the  association between a disease and a candidate gene.  However, except for some rare diseases, such as Huntington or Tay Sachs disease which may be the result of a deficiency of a single gene product,  most common human diseases have a multifactorial etiology involving complex interplay of many genetic and environmental factors. By identifying and characterizing such complicated gene-environment interactions through clinical and epidemiological studies, one has more opportunities to understand the genesis and etiology of complex diseases and to develop targeted intervention strategies for high-risk individuals. The proposal presents robust and efficient statistical techniques to investigate the synergism between gene and environment in studying complex diseases. The high-performance computing tools developed in the proposal makes it feasible to use the methods in large-scale applications such as genome-wide association studies.",Bhramar Mukherjee|

The study of all planetary atmospheres, including comets, has reached the stage where complex model simulations are required to understand and interpret their global distribution and dynamics. This comet-modeling program uniquely addresses the full range of cometary coma phenomena and physical regimes with state-of-the-art numerical simulation codes. Drs. Combi and Gombosi have the demonstrated experience in applying these codes directly to the analysis of observations. Continuing development of models benefits from the rapid expansion in capabilities of computers (speed, number of processors and memory) and high performance algorithms enabling multi-dimensional simulation techniques to be applied.  The tightly integrated approach of this effort is unique and particularly powerful for the study of multiscale phenomena, from the scale of meters near the surface to tens of millions of km far from the nucleus. In comets various physical and chemical processes operate on highly disparate scales, therefore this methodology has particular significance for understanding the delicate interplay between a wide range of aeronomical, dusty gas dynamic and plasma-physical processes.     The long term goal of this project is the development and application of a multiscale, self-consistent  comprehensive modeling capability for neutrals and plasma in cometary atmospheres extending from the complex 3D nucleus to tens of millions of kilometers into the outer atomic coma and tail and the contaminated (by cometary pick-up ions) solar wind. The model will support analysis and interpretation of spectroscopic and morphological observations of cometary environments at all stages of its development.     Specific scientific objectives for this funding period, which represent the intellectual merit, of the  proposed research are:  1. To combine 3D dusty-gas kinetics and 3D magnetohydro-dynamic (MHD) models with a thermo-physical model description for the nucleus surface/coma boundary layer to make a unique modeling tool for understanding the entire range of observed cometary coma phenomena.  2. To apply multispecies (multiple continuity equations) MHD to comets and to perform a complete parameter study of the effects of time-variations of solar wind (IMF direction, plasma sheet crossings, etc.) on the ion tail, as well as using steady-state simulations for a parameter study of the overall global variation of the comet plasma environment with gas production rate, heliocentric distance and solar wind conditions.  3. To perform the first resistive Hall MHD calculations for comets.  4. To considerably expand and generalize the integrated capability to calculate detailed x-ray emissions in comets using our 3D MHD model as a basis.  5. To use the evolving new modeling tools for interpreting observations from a variety past comets as well as target-of-opportunity comets including ion and x-ray observations.    Finally, the project has a significant broader impact in its educational component that will provide support in the training one graduate student, and additionally that the continued development of the physical and numerical methods in the models will benefit to other applications of the basic codes.

Simultaneously, the concept of encoding information into the sequence, shape and symmetry of anisotropic particle building blocks so they can assemble into complex three-dimensional (3D) structures offers tremendous potential.  Taken together, these two areas each represent one level of a new hierarchical assembly paradigm that can input spherical nanocolloidal precursors and, by way of anisotropic building blocks, output complex 3D terminal structures with a range of new, active functionalities.  Yet, to date, the two levels of the assembly hierarchy have advanced independently on the different scales of microparticles (fabrication) and molecules (anisotropic assembly) rather than together at the nanoscale.  In this project we seek to address the key fundamental scientific challenges needed to realize this hierarchical paradigm at nanoscale dimensions where there is rich new potential for applications requiring active functionality for materials in photonics, electronics and energy management.  In this aim we are supported by our recent discovery that fluidic processing can be used to assemble microparticles into permanently bonded anisotropic building blocks with high sequence and shape fidelity.  Our prior research has additionally shown vis simulation that anisotropic building blocks are a key foundation from which 3D terminal structures can be assembled.  Building on this experience in fluidic manufacturing and anisotropic particle assembly, our work plan is organized to address four key fundamental science and engineering design questions that arise as the hierarchical assembly paradigm is extended to the nanoscale.  First, to address the potential for fouling in nanofluidic channels, as particle size is reduced into the nanoscale range, we will study how anisotropic building blocks interact with fluidic channels of complex design.  Second, we will harness this understanding to discover the fluidic designs that optimally produce building blocks of novel sequence, shape and chirality.  Third, given that a suite of such novel building blocks are now available, and that a given complex 3D terminal structure has been targeted for assembly, we will search for optimal ways to design the anisotropic building blocks for self- and guided assembly.  Finally, we will discover how to execute self- or guided- assembly operations so as to achieve the target structures from the manufactured building blocks.  These objectives, each with intrinsic intellectual merit, will be addressed through an integrated research program that brings to bear our state-of-the-art capabilities in nanofabrication, fluidic manufacturing, nanocolloid assembly, direct visualization by confocal and electron microscopy and computer simulation of anisotropic building block interactions and assembly.  Simultaneously, by developing new data repository and wiki cyber tools within the National Science Digital Library framework, we will create a clear conduit for dissemination of our discoveries so as to contribute to the integration of the broader national nanoscale science and engineering community, to the training and education of our students and to the improvement of the participation of underrepresented groups and low to moderate income students from the southeastern Michigan area.    The broader impact of our work will be to advance the national effort in nanoscale science and engineering by creating underlying scientific understanding that enables the penetration of fluidic manufacturing and anisotropic building block assembly into the nanocolloidal size regime where potential applications are richest.  Furthermore, by creating new avenues for research dissemination and learning through the framework of data repositories and wikis, we can further integrate the national research communities, our students and our region into the exciting research frontier of nanofluidic manufacturing and anisotropic building block assembly.",Michael Solomon|Mark Burns|Joanna Mirecki Millunchick|Sharon Glotzer

Snezana Stanimirovic (University of Wisconsin - Madison), Mary Putman (University of Michigan), and Eric Korpela (University of California - Berkeley) will survey the Galaxy in neutral hydrogen (HI) across the entire Arecibo Observatory sky (13,000 square degrees).  This project will reveal the detailed spatial and kinematic structure of Galactic neutral hydrogen (HI) and allow new studies of the gaseous disk, halo, and the flow of material between them to be completed. Surveying the entire Arecibo sky has only recently become possible with the installment of the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA), a cluster of seven receivers operating at the wavelength of 21-cm that provide an unsurpassed combination of sensitivity, resolution, and mapping speed.  Topics already being uncovered by the survey are: 1) the evolution between atomic and molecular clouds, 2) the interplay between the Galactic disk and halo, and 3) the detailed gas dynamics at work in the Galactic halo.  In the Galactic disk, the high-resolution Arecibo observations, when compared with other interstellar tracers, probe the nature of the molecular gas not traced by carbon monoxide, the so called ""dark gas"". In addition, statistical investigation of HI datasets will relate properties of interstellar turbulence with the underlying physical conditions. The transition region between the Galactic disk and halo, when viewed by Arecibo, consists of a thick ""belt"" of numerous cold, discrete HI clouds. The survey will map the extent of this belt and investigate its possible connection to the local sites of star formation in the Galactic disk and galactic fountain models. In the Galactic halo itself, research will focus on the interaction between HI halo clouds known as high-velocity clouds (HVCs) and the surrounding diffuse halo gas. This will be done by studying the detailed features of the clouds in the context of models of the halo and comparing the cloud dynamics directly to simulations. The initial survey data also show that Arecibo will superbly sample the unexplored tail-end of the HVC population.  At the heart of this project are synergistic studies of Galactic HI with surveys at other wavelengths and the latest numerical simulations of the interstellar medium and gaseous halo. This Galactic HI survey, confronted with theory and numerical simulations, promises fundamental contributions to our understanding of the cycling of matter in the Galaxy on scales from a few pc to many kpc.    The data products from this survey will have a true legacy character, as the observations, data reduction, and final collating of the data cubes have been successfully developed, and these final data products will be made available to the public on a timely basis.  The dissemination of these data products, will enhance the infrastructure for Galactic research across the world. This research will provide topics for Ph.D. theses and undergraduate research projects at the University of California-Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, fostering the confluence of research and education. Images of the Galactic HI sky will be displayed at outreach centers at the three institutions to demonstrate the multi-wavelength character of the Galaxy to the public.",Mary Putman|

Edwin Bergin and Nuria Calvert (University of Michigan) will undertake a comprehensive observational and theoretical approach to unlock some significant uncertainties that remain in our understanding of the formation of stars, planets, and the origin of water-bearing worlds.  The program of research will provide observational comment on current controversies regarding the formation of massive stars and examine whether star formation is similar between the local solar neighborhood and in the 5 kiloparsec Molecular Ring where the majority of stars are born.  They will use a newly identified H2 emission feature to directly detect gas within an orbital radius of 5-10 Astronomical Units around young stars. These observations will be ~100 times more sensitive with ~50 times more angular resolution than previous efforts in this area.  As part of this program, they will characterize and show the tremendous promise of using molecular emission to detect the observational signatures of forming giant protoplanets. This will sow the seeds for a long-term observational program to use the Atacama Large Millimeter Array for planet detection. They will also use new facilities to search for H2O emission in protoplanetary disks. With the combination of new data and chemical theory they will constrain the water cycle from the beginnings of stellar birth to planet formation.    This research program encompasses several disparate fields including: astronomy, chemistry, physics, (astro)biology, and education. As such it has clear cross-discipline and broad impact.  This project also contains training for the next generation of scientists to be capable of taking advantage of future facilities that represent a key national investment in astronomical science, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, Herschel, The Stratosphereic Observatory For Infrared Astronomy, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the planned ground-based large optical/infrared telescope.",Edwin Bergin|Nuria Calvet

Recent stellar models have demonstrated that the effects of rotation are far from negligible and can influence the lifetimes, surface brightnesses, surface abundances, and evolutionary tracks of rapidly rotating stars. Here, the investigators will take advantage of a new instrument, the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC), which was commissioned last year at the Georgia State University Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy's 6-telescope optical interferometer. With it, they will survey the surfaces of fast rotating stars, directly mapping the latitude-dependence of gravity darkening and testing the von Zeipel-Roche model for such stars. Through detailed modeling of the line profiles, spectral energy distributions, and interferometry visibilities/closure phases, quantitative models of the stellar photospheres' oblateness and gravity darkening laws will be developed. This work will be compared to the recent models to constrain the internal structure and nature of differential rotation in hot stars for the first time. Finally, the continuum emission of Be star disks will also be imaged, which when combined with emission line measurements and the spectral energy distribution, will allow the construction of the most accurate disk models to date. The goal is to determine the temperature structure and density of the disks and to link these properties back to the formation mechanism.    The work here will form the Ph.D. thesis of a graduate student who will be trained in the use of forefront astronomical instrumentation.

In particular, star formation is perhaps the worst understood and least developed ingredients of modern cosmological simulations.  This collaborative project, led by Dr Kravtsov, aims to reduce greatly the uncertainty in the physics of galaxy formation by developing new, observationally motivated models for the formation of stars and star clusters.  Recent advances in numerical algorithms and computing power mean that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations can now resolve the actual sites of star formation in the interstellar medium, making it possible to track the formation and destruction of giant molecular clouds self-consistently.  The planned suite of ultra high-resolution N-body and gas dynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations will incorporate an unprecedented wealth of physical processes, including the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust and its self-shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation, and self-consistent three-dimensional continuum radiative transfer.  On smaller unresolved scales, the simulations will incorporate star formation recipes based on reliable empirical correlations.  The planned research will study the molecular content of high-redshift galaxies, develop star formation prescriptions consistent with the observational correlations, and study star formation in different galactic environments.  It will address the formation and evolution of massive star clusters, for which abundant observational data exist, and investigate the dependence of cluster formation efficiency on properties of the host galaxy.    This project is unique in its ability to bridge the large scales of galaxy formation and the small scales of star formation, thus developing links between those two research communities.  By involving students, the work provides professional training of young computational cosmologists in cutting-edge simulation techniques.  The results provide support for current and forthcoming space- and ground-based observing programs.  The research results are tightly integrated into academic teaching, and public education and outreach activities.

These surveys can identify all of the most massive clusters in the Universe, which will then be mined for clues to dark energy.  However, accurate conclusions require understanding the astrophysics that limits systematic uncertainties.  This is a computational project to improve understanding of clusters as multi-component, dynamically active systems.  State-of-the-art simulations with a range of astrophysical treatments will characterize how the intrinsic, visible content of clusters relates to total mass and epoch.  Studying multiple characteristics simultaneously will provide the first estimates of covariance between important, independent measures, such as X-ray temperature and luminosity, optical richness, and total gas thermal energy.  Mock sky maps will be used to test and improve cluster detection methods.  The studies will be of general use for all cluster surveys, and will include measuring the statistical form of property covariance, understanding the causes and magnitudes of projected source confusion, and testing the effects of merger-driven transients.    This project will train students in analysis involving data-intensive, high performance computing.

This research project will analyze and explain how changing environmental governance mechanisms have affected logging and forest-cover change in two countries in the Congo Basin, Cameroon and the Republic of Congo.  A multidisciplinary team of investigators will seek answers to two main questions:  (1) How do variations in partnerships among country governments, logging companies, and third parties (NGOs, donors, local actors) affect the content of concession agreements, and practices and environmental outcomes related to logging concessions?  (2) How do armed conflict, shifts in trade and currency values, and increased monitoring of and information on logging practices, forest-cover change, and associated outcomes modify the micro- and macro-level impacts of new and evolving governance arrangements?  In answering these questions, the researchers will focus on disentangling the many intertwined and multi-level causal processes that shape forest cover and forest change.  These include macroeconomic changes, armed conflict, extra-legal activities, and behaviors of actors such as government agencies, logging companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and local users.  To identify and understand the complex, nonlinear processes through which micro-level choices of hundreds of actors shape aggregate outcomes, the investigators will deploy mathematical, statistical, and agent-based modeling techniques.  They anticipate that their research and educational activities will lead to a series of workshops, including a capstone final workshop on governance and logging, several scientific papers on the relationship between governance, logging and forest cover, two synthesis volumes on ""Logging in the Congo Basin"" and ""Environmental Governance and Agent Based Models,"" and the training of nearly 20 graduate students in advanced quantitative methods and modeling techniques.    The research project is significant because it will explain how changes in forms of governance affect logging and forest cover outcomes in a world region that is extremely important in relation to biodiversity conservation, tropical forest cover, and carbon sequestration, but which has remained quite understudied.  The research will contribute to future scientific advancement in three ways.  It will assemble and make publicly available a consolidated data repository on logging concessions in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo.  This data repository will help other researchers investigate how governance arrangements, the characteristics of logging concessions and concessionaires, local and international NGOs, and new forms of financing through civil society partnerships influence forest cover and change.  The project will build partnerships across conventional divisions among academic researchers, NGO professional, and government officials to facilitate the adoption of useful findings in policy contexts, donor funding strategies, and changing governance arrangements.  It will thereby create a broader public audience and use for scientific findings.  Finally, the project will support the training of more than twenty U.S. and African students to conduct field research, analyze data, and deploy advanced computational and modeling techniques and thereby build greater capacity for scientific research in the Congo Basin.

Understanding the processes maintaining such widespread fitness variation is a major goal of evolutionary biology research. The proposed research merges population genetics theory with experiments on X-chromosome fitness variation in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to test an influential model of fitness variation - overdominant selection - that maintains genetic diversity by favoring individuals that are genetically variable. By focusing on X-linked variation, patterns associated with the overdominant selection process can be disentangled from potentially obscuring patterns produced by other evolutionary processes.    This research will shed light on the role of selection in preserving population genetic variation, and will have important implications for related biological disciplines, particularly those aiming to mitigate the negative effects of inbreeding (e.g., animal husbandry and wildlife conservation), or understand the causes and persistence of human genetic disease.

This proposal will investigate diffusive crystal dissolution in silicate melts ? one of the key processes in igneous petrogenesis. In a magma conduit, chamber or ocean, entrained xenoliths/xenocrysts and newly crystallized minerals would sink or rise depending on their density relative to the melt. The relative motion induces convection. Upon descent or ascent, each mineral grain could undergo dissolution in the presence of convection. The convective dissolution rate of minerals in silicate melts has not been quantified before. Recent theory can predict convective dissolution rates; the necessary input parameters include the system conditions (melt and mineral compositions as well as temperature and pressure), melt and mineral density, the solubility of the mineral, diffusivity of the principal equilibrium-determining component, and viscosity of the melt. This project is designed to constrain these parameters. Viscosity and density can be estimated from available models. The diffusivity and solubility may be extracted from diffusive dissolution experiments. New work is proposed work as follows: (i) testing the theory for applicability in magmatic systems; (ii) conducting diffusive crystal dissolution experiments, from which diffusivity and solubility will be extracted; (iii) quantifying data from diffusive crystal dissolution experiments as a function of temperature and pressure; (iv) developing models to predict diffusive and convective crystal dissolution rates in nature, focusing on convective dissolution rates as a function of temperature and pressure for a given mineral-melt system. The ultimate goal is to develop a tool to predict convective dissolution rate of crystals in natural silicate melts, with application to digestion or survival of xenocrysts in magmas.

These fundamental thermodynamic data for carbonate liquids, especially those containing CaCO3 and MgCO3, will permit thermodynamic models of partial melting for carbonate-bearing mantle rocks.  Such models are needed to rigorously evaluate the complex global carbon cycle, which includes the subduction of carbonated oceanic crust, the formation of carbonatite melts that metasomatize diverse mantle lithologies, the partial melting of these carbonated rocks, and the subsequent volcanic outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere.  Thermodynamic property measurements on multi-component carbonate liquids are of interest not only to earth scientists, but also to material scientists interested in molten carbonate fuel cells to derive energy from hydrogen.     We plan to add 10-50 mol % CaCO3 and MgCO3 (and 10-30 mol % FeCO3) to various mixed alkali (Li-Na-K) carbonate liquids with low melting temperatures, and to perform measurements of heat capacity (by differential scanning calorimetry; DSC), density (by the double-bob Archimedean method), and sound speed (by acoustic interferometry) to obtain melt compressibility.  An additional objective is to perform a series of phase equilibrium experiments to locate the fusion curves of various carbonate phases (e.g., K2Ca(CO3)2, Na2Ca(CO3)2, Na2CO3, CaCO3, MgCO3, KLiCO3, etc.) in P-T space.  From these two sets of experimental data, we propose to use fusion curve analysis to constrain the enthalpies of fusion of the various carbonate phases as well as their respective liquid values (the pressure dependence of their melt compressibility).",Rebecca Lange|

However, tribal governments are much more limited in their ability to access capital. Many tribal communities are often burdened with extremely low socio-economic factors, including low educational achievement, high unemployment, high poverty, and low per capita income. Upwards of $50 billion of unmet capital needs go unfunded each year in Indian Country, in large part due to impediments to tribal access to the capital markets. There are numerous reasons tribes are at a disadvantage, but one little studied is information asymmetry. Relatively poor market awareness is both a cause of tribal underdevelopment and an impediment to any solution. Because most tribes confront information asymmetries for any debt financing strategy they might consider, an empirical study of successful information sharing and integration strategies for tax-exempt bonds will help identify suitable strategies to induce sharing in other domains where tribes operate at an informational disadvantage.    Based on preliminary work (IIS 0534905), this Tribal Finance Information Clearinghouse (TFIC) project will make three unique contributions to information science. First it will collect, aggregate, analyze, and disseminate new digital content consisting of access to market-actionable data on tribal tax-exempt bonds that is not currently available. Second, it will generate data about the factors that impede or induce contributions of private information to a collective information good. (Broadly, insight into how to design information systems that resolve the social dilemmas of information collaboration is an increasingly important.) Finally, the TFIC will be an exercise in informational empowerment. By presenting original financial data as part of a larger infrastructure that includes updated content regarding regulatory, legal, and legislative changes, industry news, and a forum to contribute lessons learned, the TFIC will add significant informational value to transactional data. The TFIC will also support multidisciplinary research on the design and use of information technologies and the resulting impact on government institutions and citizens.    Broader Impact  Without empirical data about tribal interactions with capital markets, many research questions remain unanswerable. With this project, for the first time, these may be answerable as the TFIC will offer researchers and policy-makers an unparalleled opportunity to analyze a complete data set related to a significant minority group and to determine whether information asymmetries, legal regulations, or other variables impact capital markets access for tribes. Not only will the outcomes directly impact Native Americans, but the results may be generalizable to other minority enterprises that also face impeded market access. The relatively small number of actors (i.e., 88 tribal issuers since 2001) with durable presence in the data makes study of capital access questions more manageable than might be the case with non-tribal entities.    The TFIC may also impact the marketplace itself, given that a recent study of non-tribal tax-exempt bonds found that the ""most critical consequence"" of information asymmetry is higher borrowing costs, but that ""alleviating information asymmetry"" reliably eliminates the risk premium and reduces borrowing costs, particularly for new or infrequent issuers such as tribes.",Gavin Clarkson|Joseph Kalt

The   models will be based on the calculus of variations and partial   differential equations (PDE) that describe curve and surface   evolutions. A main goal of the project will be to devise new models   that incorporate prior shape information into existing variational   image segmentation techniques such as the Mumford-Shah model and its   variants. The new models will be designed to find in given images   objects resembling a specified shape regardless of the objects'   location and orientation in the image. In addition, they will have   convenient numerical implementations using techniques that have already   proven their utility in related vision applications, such as the level   set method. A second area of research will be to develop novel,   efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of PDE that arise in a   number of computer vision models and in other fields such as material   science. Specifically, the investigator will explore new computational   techniques for the solution of high order PDE that describe geometric   motion of interfaces, such as the Willmore flow and motion by surface   diffusion. These evolutions are computationally very expensive using   current techniques. The new approach will be to reduce the computation   of these motions to alternating simple operations for which efficient   algorithms are already available. Also in this vein, the project will   develop new numerical algorithms inspired by models and techniques in   image processing for the computation of energy driven dynamics of   multiple phases and junctions.    Image segmentation is a fundamental procedure of computer vision. It is   a necessary preliminary step whenever useful information is to be   extracted from digital images automatically. Its goal is to identify   parts of the image that belong to distinct objects, often without   knowing what objects might be present in the image. In many practical   applications, however, a specific object of known shape is sought in   the images. For example, in aerial imagery, the object of interest   might be a certain vehicle that has a distinctive outline. Or, in a   medical application, it might be desired to identify automatically the   individual vertebrae in x-ray images of the spine. It such settings, it   would help the success rate of the segmentation procedure if the   algorithms could be made aware of what is being sought. This project   will develop models and numerical techniques that incorporate prior   shape information about objects of interest into the segmentation   process, thereby leading to better segmentation methods.",Selim Esedoglu|

Unfortunately, these solvers often suffer from temporal (low-frequency) and spatial (dense-mesh) breakdown phenomena when applied to the analysis of low- to medium-frequency electromagnetic transients on geometrically intricate and multiscale structures, thereby preventing their application to many important scientific and engineering problems. This project seeks the development of new plane wave time domain-accelerated, regularized MOT-TDIE solvers that are immune to temporal and spatial breakdown phenomena.  The proposed techniques eliminate temporal and spatial breakdown phenomena in MOT-TDIE solvers by leveraging hierarchical basis functions and new time domain Calderon identities, respectively. In addition, they guaranty low-frequency stability in MOT-TDIE solvers by exploiting the spectral properties of the Calderon regularizer. MOT-TDIE solvers resulting from this effort will permit the fast analysis of low- to medium-frequency electromagnetic transients on geometrically intricate and mixed-scale structures. The educational objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive set of educational materials supporting a course covering all aspects of fast MOT-TDIE technology and to use them in teaching and outreach.    The development of fast and higher-order accurate MOT-TDIE solvers that robustly and seamlessly apply across spatial and temporal scales will permit the analysis of a wide class of scientific and real-world electromagnetic engineering problems that are intractable using present day methods. Given their grid-robust nature, the electromagnetic simulators resulting from this effort will permit optical scientists to rigorously analyze transient effects in nonlinear and disordered metamaterials and nanostructures without resorting to homogenization approximations, thereby creating a new avenue for controlling and directing the flow and electromagnetic waves and light in fibers and on chips. In addition, they will allow electronic engineers to design digital integrated circuits and RF wireless sensors without resorting to ad-hoc spatial decomposition methods, thereby resulting in significant savings in development time and costs.

Many scientific and engineering research communities are developing large multidisciplinary collaborations to develop cyberinfrastructure (CI).   The goal of CI is to create virtual environments, where researchers and educators can access distributed resources (e.g., computational tools and services, instruments, experiments, and data).  Although CI initiatives are expected to have a significant impact on research productivity and there is considerable enthusiasm around the promise of CI, there has been little systematic evaluation of CI initiatives to date. This project is a pilot study to conduct an evaluation of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) CI.   NEES became operational in 2004 as a shared use experimental and cyber infrastructure for the earthquake engineering and related communities.  At the heart of NEES is ""NEESit,"" the NEES cyberinfrastructure center that develops, deploys, and operates the set of CI systems and applications used to link earthquake engineers across the United States with leading-edge computational resources, research equipment (i.e., the fifteen NEES equipment sites), simulation and visualization tools, and collaborators to plan, perform, and publish experiments.  NEES is managed by NEES Consortium, Inc. (NEESinc), through NSF cooperative agreement CMMI-0402490, who oversees both NEES equipment sites and NEESit.  The NEES CI evaluation has two objectives: (1) to examine how NEES CI facilitates researcher access to distributed resources and the impact such access has on research productivity, and (2) to inform ongoing and future CI-based initiatives.  In order to accomplish both objectives, the evaluation is designed to not only assess NEES CI, but also provide assessment data to benchmark NEES CI against other NSF-funded CI-based environments (e.g. TeraGrid, LEAD, and WATERS  Network).  Evaluation methods include interviews, observations of scientists and engineers at work, surveys, and bibliometrics.    This project includes an examination and evaluation of mechanisms within NEES that support CI use in general, and knowledge sourcing and multi-site researcher collaboration activities, specifically. Contributions of this work include improved theoretical understanding of how CI can function to enhance these activities, practical suggestions about the design of CI to facilitate them, and specific feedback about how NEES CI is aiding them within the earthquake engineering community.  CI is a major NSF investment on many fronts.  This project's evaluation methodology will follow those used to investigate the same phenomena in different NSF-funded CI-based environments.  This approach will help assimilate findings with other CI research communities, which means the lessons learned and promising practices identified in the course of specific evaluations can inform the design of CI-based environments more generally.

Hillewaert, under the guidance of Dr. Judith T. Irvine, will undertake research on youth linguistic and semiotic practices in a social environment affected by migration, urbanization, and tourism. The researcher will investigate whether and how language offers young people a means to cope with rapidly changing social contexts and with the contradictory demands of ""tradition"" and ""modernity."" The research will be carried on the island of Lamu, which is Kenya's oldest Swahili settlement. The researcher will examine how youth negotiate their relation to Kenya's mainland urban youth language, Sheng, while living in an environment that gives value to a pure form of Swahili.     The researcher will test two key hypotheses: 1) Tourism, urbanization, and migration instil feelings of alienation and displacement among youth, who mobilize broadened linguistic repertoires in an attempt to redefine their positions in society; 2) Changing linguistic and semiotic practices offer a means to grapple with social flux. She will analyze Kenyans' interpretations of language use, and how these mediate the formation of social groups, identities, or relations. This will permit insight into the creativity of youth to reinvent personhood and agency in reference to tradition and new sets of social and economic relationships. Four research methods will be utilized to investigate these propositions: long term participant observation; semi-structured interviews; detailed linguistic analysis of daily interactions; and spatial analysis - using mapping and visual documentation to record the placement and movement of people.     This research will contribute to anthropological theory by allowing new understandings of how location, identity, and language are re-imagined and re-invented in relation to each other and to a rapidly changing social context.

A study of the presence and, equally telling, the strategic absence of a spoken local variety of German in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil,  can indicate how speakers enter into national discourses of equal rights, what it means to be a group with a distinct history or ethnicity, and ultimately what it means to be a minority group. In 1824 the first immigrants from Hunsruck (an area in the southwest of today''s Germany) arrived in Rio Grande do Sul to face a harsh physical environment and hostilities from indigenous and neighboring peoples. Today, some 700,000 people in Rio Grande do Sul speak Hunsruckisch German, the last significant wave of German immigrants having arrived just after World War II.     The research will use ethnographic and formal linguistic research methods to analyze how speech styles relate to nonlinguistic (aesthetic) styles, and how these relate to the representation of  other ethnic minorities in Brazil.  Data will be gathered by  living with Hunsruckisch speakers in two different sites, accompanying them to gatherings that nonHunsruckisch speakers attend as well, and pursuing archival research. Linguistic samples will be recorded in  both formal and informal contexts and the data will be analyzed for formal variation of specific linguistic  features.    The research is important because it will aid in the understanding of the implications of immigrant identity for social relations and policy, and the role of language in a multilinguistic context in constructing it.

Indeed, individual recognition is the primary means of assessment for most primate species. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that humans also use physical characteristics (?quality signals?) as a way to evaluate others ? particularly in the context of competition and mating. One reason why humans might utilize quality signals is because they live in extremely large social groups where they frequently encounter individuals they do not recognize. However, this hypothesis is difficult to test because quality signals are rare among primates, and little is known about the function and use of signaling in non-human primates. Thus, the main objective of this research is to determine how primates living in large groups ?size up? potential rivals and mates ? a task that involves mapping the boundary of where individual recognition ends and where other short-hand means of assessment begin. The subjects for this research are wild geladas (Theropithecus gelada), a monkey that lives only in the highlands of Ethiopia. Geladas are an ideal species for this research for two reasons. First, while the vast majority of primates live in small groups where individuals recognize every group member, geladas (like humans) live in extremely large groups where individual recognition may not extend beyond a small subgroup. Second, male geladas are unusual among primates in having 2 conspicuous traits that may serve as quality signals, a red patch of skin on the chest and neck, and ritualized display vocalizations. By combining behavioral observations, experimental playbacks, and laboratory analysis of fecal steroid hormones, this research addresses 3 questions: (1) What are the limits of individual recognition in gelada society? (2) For recognized individuals, do they base reproductive decisions on this information? (3) Alternatively (or additionally), do geladas use quality signals, such as chest color or vocal displays, to evaluate potential competitors or mates?     The PI and co-PI of this project are committed to integrating research goals with education and conservation at several levels. First, over the course of this three-year project, a post-doc will receive training in playback experiments and hormone analysis, 4-6 graduate students will gain summer field experience, and 6-8 undergraduates will gain experience analyzing data for senior theses. Second, it is expected that 1-3 Ethiopian graduate students in primate behavior will join the project. Third, an Ethiopian counterpart will be sponsored for graduate training in wildlife management. Finally, this project's research presence in the Simien Mountains National Park (currently on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger) is assisting conservation efforts. Conservation projects that have been initiated thus far include: a census of geladas living in the area, a survey for tourists on park conservation, and a survey for the local people to gauge the degree of human-wildlife conflict. Both the PI and co-PI will continue to dedicate a fraction of their field time to conservation efforts in the area.",Thore Bergman|Jacinta Beehner

The accuracy of such inferences can be questionable because determining a species identity often depends on the type of data used. This project will apply recent theoretical and methodological advances developed in population genetics to determine species limits. The Caribbean cricket genus Amphiacusta will be used to explore ways in which population genetic models and alternative sampling designs can improve the accuracy of inferred species boundaries when different types of data and different rates of divergence exist among populations.    The methods developed by the project will enable improved sampling design for a diversity of approaches used in species delimitation, including those applied in conservation biology and DNA-barcoding initiatives. The results of these analyses will also produce recommendations about how genetic data, including data from multiple loci, can be combined with other data types to produce a unified approach for recognizing species. These tools will be of use for a wide range of taxa, and are expected to impact a large cross-section of disciplines given the central role that species, and their delimitation, play in biology and society at large.",L.

Botnets exhibit these: intruders know more about the purpose of their intrusion than do the computer&#65533;s owners; users are cajoled to take precautions but their actual effort is not directly observable; and the costs of poor home security are borne more by others (who suffer from bot attacks) than by the owner of the compromised machine (a negative externality).

Photosystem II binds the chlorophyll molecules that absorb the light energy required for oxygen production, as well as the atoms of manganese, calcium and chloride that form the site of oxygen production in the enzyme.  The enzyme consists of a number of proteins that anchor it in a membrane, but it also contains three proteins that are not associated with the membrane.  Removal of one of these proteins, called PsbO, or ''manganese-stabilizing protein'' from the enzyme causes a loss of calcium and chloride cofactors and a loss of oxygen production as well.  This research project addresses the role of PsbO in oxygen production.  A series of genetically modified PsbO proteins have been developed with prior support from NSF; some of these proteins exhibit an interesting modification in their ability to rebind to photosystem II.  Normally, two copies of the protein are present.  Mutant proteins are available that exhibit binding of two, only one or of no copies of PsbO.  The consequences of these modified protein stoichiometries on cofactor binding and stability of manganese retention will be determined.  In addition, mutations in PsbO that modify amino acids that may be required for calcium binding will be characterized, and experiments will be carried out to determine whether PsbO might form part of a channel that conducts water to the site of oxygen formation in the enzyme.  Results of this research project will provide more information on the unique chemistry of oxygen evolution, a reaction that may some day be used in synthetic systems for energy production.    Broader Impacts  A principle aim of this project is to provide hands on research experience for undergraduate students who are majoring in the life sciences.

A junior faculty member who teaches chemistry at Spring Arbor University will collaborate in this project so as to provide him with research facilities that can be combined with his teaching activities.  Finally, the P.I. teaches two undergraduate courses (biochemistry, plant molecular biology) in which lectures on photosynthesis, and discussions of the research literature form an important part of the offerings.",Charles Yocum|Hana Popelkova

The frequency of occurrence of a particularly extreme form of gene tree/species tree discordance - in which the most probable genetic pattern in a set of species does not match the species tree shape - will be studied using computation and simulation, and an understanding of this extreme discordance will be incorporated into novel algorithms for inferring species trees.

Pecoraro at the University of Michigan to expand the breadth of metallacrown complexes with regard to the: 1) Preparation of peripherally adorned chiral metallacrowns. 2) Selective recognition of guests in molecular compartments 3) Modular synthesis of chiral solids, and 4) Development of new classes of single molecule magnets.     The focus is on the synthesis of 12 and 15 membered metallamacrocycles that have made new chiral solids. These proposed 12-MC-4 and 15-MC-5 molecules may be prepared with a variety of metals, which will allow moderation of the physical properties of the compounds.  Chiral 12-MC-4 structures will be prepared using beta-aminohydroxamic acids whereas 15-MC-5 structures will be produced when alpha-aminohydroxamic acids are used.  The structure and properties of these metallacrowns can be drastically altered by modifying the sidechains of these aminohydroxamic acids.  Sidechains such as benzyl (phenylalanine) or p-hydroxybenzyl (tyrosine) allow formation of metallamacrocyclic dimers in the solid state that can differentially recognize mono and dicarboxylic acids and chiral amino acids. Experiments aim to decorate these cavities with functionalities that will aid selective recognition of other molecules, including chiral carboxylates and alcohols.  By changing heteroatom donors of the hydroxamic acids, it is proposed that modification of the metal composition of the metallacrown complexes will be possible. A modular synthetic approach for preparing layered, chiral solids is presented.     The observation that metallamacrocycles molecules may act as magnets (single molecule magnetism or SMM) promises use in magnetic storage devices.  Chiral recognition by metallacrowns may provide the basis of new methods for separations of chiral molecules using either selective crystallization or chromatographic methods. It may be possible to perform separations of amino acids, amino alcohols or hydroxy acids that are important starting materials for many organic and pharmaceutical syntheses. The modular approach for porous solid synthesis may provide a way to make new catalysts or storage materials.",Vincent Pecoraro|

Information about the left/right location of a sound source is provided by the differences of time-of-arrival and sound level between the signals reaching the left and right ears.  However, these between-ear differences are insufficient to specify front/rear location or up/down location. Some information about those dimensions can be provided through the outer ears' direction-dependent filtering, but a listener can take a more active role in localization by moving the head: Dynamic information is provided by the relation between head motion and the resulting changes in inter-aural differences.     With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ewan Macpherson will investigate the effectiveness of the information provided by head motion, and the way it interacts with other information about sound location. Normal-hearing listeners will attempt to localize real and synthesized sound sources, both while the head is stationary and while the head is in motion.

Scholars have proposed various accounts for this limited attainment of older learners compared to young children, including critical periods for language acquisition, sociocultural differences, motivational effects, and restricted language input. Such accounts have profoundly different implications for second language instruction, its likely success, and the best means of attaining it. This research project considers alternative explanations in terms of cognitive principles of learning and transfer, in particular, attentional processes in the associative learning of form-meaning relations for linguistic constructions. The investigators will examine the learning phenomena of salience, cue redundancy, and the attentional blocking of later experienced cues by earlier ones, and how individual differences in working memory capacity modulates these effects.    This is an highly integrative research exercise, bridging the psychologies of learning and development, cognitive science, linguistics, language acquisition, and education. The interdisciplinary nature of the research relies on a variety of convergent methods: laboratory learning of temporal reference in a small subset of Latin under experimental conditions, eye-movement studies of attention in reading second language Spanish, analyses of development in regular university Spanish foreign language courses, training studies, and the development of classroom or lab-based foreign language instructional interventions.    Findings from this research will provide: (1) important theoretical insights into psychological processes of learned attention and transfer in second language acquisition, uniting the psychology of learning and second language acquisition in developing instruction-relevant, cognitive rather than biological, explanations of limited second language attainment; (2) detailed interdisciplinary understandings of these mechanisms as they occur both in naturalistic second language acquisition and in instructed foreign language courses; (3) forms of second language training that are based on these theoretical understandings; and (4) evaluations of the instructional efficacy of these practices.",Nicholas Ellis|Anna Theakston

Westerners perceive and reason in ways that can be described as analytic. They tend to focus on some salient object, identify its attributes, categorize the object, and apply rules to model and explain the object's behavior, and the rules employed include formal logic. In contrast, East Asians perceive and reason in ways that can be called holistic.  They tend to focus on the broad field in which an object is located and the relation between the object and the field.  Relationships and similarities are used to organize the world, and dialectical reasoning (for example, seeking the middle way between extremes) substitutes for formal logic.  The aim of this research is to establish that a particular broad aspect of culture, namely the degree of individualism vs. collectivism characteristic of a group, is a source of the cognitive differences. Westerners are independent and individualistic and they consequently have the luxury of focusing on some object with respect to which they have a goal, whereas Easterners are more interdependent and collectivist and must attend to the complicated social worlds they live in. Differences in attention, causal attribution, organization of objects and events, and reasoning derive from these differences. The proposed research measures social orientation toward individualism vs. collectivism.  The anticipation is that social orientation, and not some other factor associated with differences between Westerners and Asians, will produce the relationship between culture and cognition. In order to demonstrate that social orientation influences cognitive differences, the research will examine subcultures within the West (such as northern vs. southern Italy, eastern vs. western Europe, American Catholics vs. Protestants, working class vs. middle class) which differ in social orientation. The subcultures are expected to differ in aspects of that are considered to be analytic vs. holistic. The research is relevant to a wide range of social issues, most notably in education.

However, the ability to quantify and modify health status among African Americans is constrained by error associated with available assessment methods.  Some sources of measurement error are well understood, but others, such as the impact of interviewer characteristics on survey data, require additional investigation.  The effect of interviewer race upon survey data has been explored to some extent in face-to-face interviewing, but to a much lesser extent in telephone surveys.  This study will explore how African American telephone interviewers' ethnic identities and use of culturally associated linguistic features impact several aspects of respondent behavior; such as responses to racially topical survey items, responses to self-reported health survey items, interviewer race preferences, satisfaction with interviewers, responses to a culturally tailored health program, and program satisfaction.  Female African American telephone interviewers will be recruited to complete a self-administered, written survey measuring their ethnic identity types and sociodemographic characteristics.  Each participating interviewer also will administer a digitally recorded telephone survey with each of three standardized respondents with differing ethnic identity types and speech characteristics.  The digital recordings will be assessed using a linguistic coding system measuring the extent to which interviewers and respondents use phonological, syntactic, and discourse features associated with African American English (AAE).  Analyses will be conducted to see whether AAE features are used more frequently by interviewers with certain identity types, during surveys with respondents of certain identity types, or around racially topical parts of the interview script.  These data will be used to form a proxy variable for perceived interviewer ethnic identity in order to compare and contrast the impact of perceived versus actual interviewer identity in surveys conducted as part of a health study with 500 African American adults in Atlanta and Detroit.  The impact of interviewer-respondent ethnic identity concordance and discordance also will be explored.      This research will advance the intellectual understanding of how interviewers and respondents may reflexively impact the expression of ethnic verbal patterns in the context of telephone surveys.  The study is the first known investigation of the influence of ethnic identity on survey data, African American respondent's preferences for interviewer race, African American respondents' ratings of African American telephone interviewers, or the effects of culturally associated linguistic patterns on survey data.  The study also may result in several broader impacts.  For one, this study involves a multidisciplinary approach that draws from the fields of public health, survey methodology, linguistics, and psychology and could lead to new, cross-disciplinary linguistic coding methodologies for use in behavioral, linguistic, and survey research.  The research may improve the quality of survey data by providing an evidence-based rationale for or against race-matching in telephone health surveys with African American respondents.

Each plant species has evolved the ability to synthesize a unique set of such chemicals, often classified as secondary or specialized metabolites. While large numbers of such compounds have been identified, our understanding of the enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis is lagging far behind. Of particular interest is a group of metabolites called the phenylpropenes, consisting of a complex set of bioactive volatile chemicals including eugenol and isoeugenol, that have played important roles in human history and continue to serve important agricultural and dietary needs of humankind. The biosynthesis of the phenylpropenes, which are found only in plants, occurs through an unusual reduction reaction. The research groups led by the PI and CoPI have recently identified two representative enzymes responsible for phenylpropene biosynthesis, eugenol and isoeugenol synthases (EGS and IGS), that catalyze the formation of eugenol and isoeuegnol, respectively, from biosynthetic precursors of the plant polymer lignin. The goals of this project are to study the reaction mechanism of the EGS-IGS type enzymes, to identify related enzymes that synthesize other agriculturally and nutritionally important phenylpropenes, and to use this knowledge to modify such enzymes by rational design to create more efficient biosynthetic pathways for economically reliable sources of existing and new high-value phenylpropenes. It is hypothesized that these enzymes use a 2-step mechanism involving a quinone methide-like intermediate that has not previously been studied in detail and that may also be involved in the syntheses of other important, non-phenylpropene specialized compounds. The investigators use a multidisciplinary approach that includes biochemical, genomic and metabolomic approaches to identify new genes and enzymes for phenylpropene biosynthesis, crystallographic studies to solve the 3-dimensional structure of the proteins, and chemical synthesis of substrates and substrate analogs combined with experimentally modified enzymes to examine reaction mechanism. The project also integrates the training of high school students, teachers, undergraduate students and PhD level scientists in state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research.    The research will lead to the identification of a number of new enzymes capable of synthesizing phenylpropenes with important agricultural and nutritional properties, and result in a better understanding of how these enzymes work. It will therefore also lead to the rational engineering of new enzymes that can synthesize novel phenylpropenes with enhanced bioactivity as well as the ability to biosynthesize existing compounds more efficiently. Furthermore, since other enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of distinct plant compounds may utilize a similar mechanism, the biochemical research will increase our understanding of the function of these important enzymes as well. The project will also contribute to the multidisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists--including women and minorities--at all levels, as post-docs preparing to assume faculty positions, as graduate students, and as undergraduates preparing to choose a specific career in science. Furthermore, an outreach program to high-school teachers and students will positively influence high school students considering a career in science in the first place. To disseminate the knowledge gained in this project, the research results will be presented at scientific meetings and published in refereed scientific journals, and in addition, the researchers will give occasional talks to the general public about their work and its implications as well as contribute materials to the general public's media such as print, radio and TV as they have done in the past.",Eran Pichersky|

These receptors are localized to specialized structures known as synapses, characterized by folds in the postsynaptic membrane. Receptors are firmly held in the crest of the folds by a host of specialized scaffold proteins. The goal of this study is to investigate the dynamics of one critical component of this scaffold, rapsyn, when levels of synaptic activity are manipulated.      To address the dynamics of rapsyn at the synapse, the PI will fuse jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) to rapsyn and introduce the construct into the neck of the mouse (sternomastoid muscle). This makes it possible to monitor and image a particular synapse over the course of several days in the living animal. Receptor proteins will be labeled by fluorescent bungarotoxin, a snake venom that binds with high affinity to the receptor. The PI will investigate the following questions:  first, what is the lifetime of rapsyn at individual synapse in vivo. Second what is the effect of rapsyn overexpression on the metabolic stability of receptors in vivo. Finally, the PI will investigate the effect of synaptic activity on the dynamics of rapsyn at individual synapses in vivo.     The PI will promote the training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including those of underrepresented groups. The PI has extensive experience in training undergraduate students.

The types of simple feedstocks such as alkenes, alkynes, and dienes that are so powerful in Diels Alder reactions and other widely used cycloaddition methods typically cannot directly combine to allow assembly of odd-numbered rings. This proposal aims to develop several solutions to this existing limitation of currently available transformations. The first goal involves developing a new strategy that allows two simple even-numbered pi-systems to combine in a catalytic cycloaddition to generate a five-membered ring product while the starting materials undergo a net two-electron reduction. Secondly, simple cyclopropyl ketones and imines will be used in ring-opening cycloadditions that install a three-carbon unit from the cyclopropane into a five-membered ring product. Finally, two new reactions will be developed that involve cycloaddition of two simple two-atom pi-systems with a one carbon unit or one-silicon unit to prepare carbocyclic or silacyclic five-membered rings. In addition to new cycloaddition approaches, the proposal will also develop a novel reductive coupling procedure of alkynes and electron deficient alkenes in order to address challenges and limitations of currently available conjugate addition procedures.    With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is renewing support for the work of Professor John Montgomery, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan. While powerful methods have been developed for the synthesis of molecules containing six-membered rings, general approaches for the synthesis of five-membered rings have lagged behind. Professor Montgomery and his students are discovering fundamentally new cycloaddition processes affording access to these smaller-sized rings, which are ubiquitous in compounds displaying biological or pharmacological activity, as well as in numerous compounds of interest in a variety of other disciplines, including materials science and molecular electronics.

Multiculturalism is popularly equated with respect for hitherto underrepresented racial, ethnic, class, gender and other minority groups. However, research suggests multiculturalism policies also can maintain and reinforce hierarchies by dividing and subordinating minority groups in subtler ways. The discourse of multiculturalism only recently emerged since the 1990s in Japan, where the ideology of ethnic and cultural homogeneity is still dominant and perpetuated.    Cho will study this emerging phenomenon through research on diasporic Okinawans and Okinawa popular culture in Osaka. Okinawans have been the most successful among ethnic minorities in addressing their ethnic difference through popular culture, with the increased risk of further exoticization and commercialization of their difference. Combining participant observation, ethnographic interviews, media text analysis, and media reception studies, the researcher will explore the ways in which popular cultural practices are related to changing attitudes about ethnic relations in Japan. She will also investigate how the interactions between marginalized and dominant social groups may lead to political change through the mediation of popular culture. In doing so, this research seeks to explicate the ramifications of the emerging politics of multiculturalism in Japan.    The research is important because it will be one of the first studies of the emergence of multiculturalism politics in a non-western setting.

The predatory marine gastropod genus Conus is an extremely diverse group of tropical snails with over 500 species, with tremendous differences in diets.  These specialized hunters use a venom with neurotoxins, termed conotoxins, to capture prey.  Conus venoms are amazingly diverse both within and between species and conotoxins are proven sources of novel pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various human neuromuscular disorders.  Because venoms are intricately related to the ability to subdue prey, the evolution of Conus venoms is likely to be strongly influenced by dietary specializations.  The main objective of this research is to test hypotheses about the link between venom composition and dietary specializations of Conus and to examine the correlations between genetic and ecological differences and venom composition among populations of Conus species.  This project includes field and laboratory work to examine and compare diets and venoms of individuals of different populations of three closely related Conus species.

However, there are no experimental investigations that address either the physiological consequences of helping behavior, or whether psychological benefits mediate the helping-induced benefits. To address this gap in understanding, the proposed study examines the cardiovascular effects of helping behavior. The hypothesis, that helping behavior speeds the cardiovascular recovery from a stress-inducing experience, will be tested in a study involving 50 male and 50 female participants. The procedure involves the manipulation of perspective-taking and inducement of empathic concern for a person in need.  Non-invasive measures of cardiovascular recovery (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) will be used to assess recovery time.

Since  1998, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the top court of the European Union (EU) and  ""the most effective supranational body in the history of the world"" (Stone Sweet  2005:108), has begun to incorporate health and social security into the liberalizing EU  single market. Existing studies have focused on explaining this case of European  integration and on doing preliminary maps of power and responsibility in EU health care  policy. This project goes beyond those studies and takes this development as a case of the  impact of supranational justice on policy and implementation. It asks (1) what variance is  there in the concrete policy responses of EU member states to the decisions of the ECJ on  cross-border mobility of patients and labor regulation? And 2) what explains the variation  in EU member state responses to the developing EU law?  Answering the first question requires research to identify what ""compliance""  means to governments in different states and how much of it there has been. This  involves governments' interpretation not just of EU law but of the likely actions of the  domestic courts that interpret and apply most EU law. For the second question, there are  two clear hypotheses derived from the literature on the impact of judicial decisions on  society. One is a political hypothesis, that the success of judicial decisions is a function of  the existing ""support structure""- that decisions, without interest groups who will support  and take advantage of implementation, will have very limited impact. The other is  institutional, drawn from the literature on ""Europeanization"". It identifies the problem as  a goodness-of-fit problem; states will comply faster and better with decisions that require  less change to existing institutions.  The study will be conducted with legal elite-level interviews and legal  documentary analysis in Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The countries  have been selected because they represent a range of relevant variables- legal systems,  health systems, bureaucracies, and historic relations with EU law and policy. This plays  to the strengths of qualitative case studies in a situation with many hypotheses and few  reliable indicators. Policymakers' perceptions of their legal powers and constraints are  crucial, and best accessed through interviews and research in the relevant law.  The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in its approach to the issue of  judicialization in the EU and beyond. For the EU, it contributes to the analysis both of the  rising power of the ECJ and of its actual impact- an impact that includes both extended  EU powers over the welfare state, and the potential legitimation or delegitimation of the  European project. More broadly, it should contribute to the small literature on the  important relationship between courts and bureaucracies, identifying the effects of courts  on implementers. The broader impact will come in two ways. First, European Union  law and the welfare state is an important topic with ample potential to engage in  contemporary European debates. Second, the project incorporates student research from  the undergraduate to doctoral level, exposing students to sociolegal research and  European politics.",Scott Greer|

To date, research in social psychology has developed a broad base of knowledge about the influence of social identity on attitudes and behaviors; however, little is known about the economic consequences of these processes. Similarly, standard economic theories have explicated processes underlying individual preferences but have no systematic empirical foundation which incorporates group identity into individual preferences. This project draws on the theory and methods developed in social psychology and experimental economics to bridge the two bodies of work and inform us of the relationship between social identity and social preferences. Thus, the results of the studies will extend our knowledge in both these fields of study. The PIs will first explicitly measure the effects of social identity on social preferences.  Based on the outcome of this research, a second research stream will be initiated examining the effects of group identity and, in particular, a common identity, on contract design and public goods productions. Finally, the PIs will examine the effects of group identity on equilibrium selection, an important unresolved issue in game theory.     Broader Impact: As the world becomes more integrated, managing diversity  becomes an increasingly important issue to understand. For instance, organizations are more frequently encountering the issue of integrating a diverse workforce, and motivating members coming different backgrounds to work towards a common goal. The results of the proposed research can inform us about the role of social identity in eliciting decisions from individuals to maximize social-welfare, to prioritize organizational goals above self-interest, and to exert more effort. From the perspective of the organizations, this research will provide insights on whether an organization should invest resources to create and enforce a common identity among its workers.",Yan Chen|Margaret Shih

For the design of such policy it is essential to understand when collusion can be expected to be likely and how it can be effectively discouraged. In the past theoretical research has focused primarily on understanding the mechanisms by which a collusive agreement can be sustained over time. In contrast, anecdotal evidence suggests that the primary impact of antitrust policy is to disrupt the process by which firms reach collusive agreements. Very little is known about how firms come to such agreements and it has proved extremely difficult to identify this from field data. This is therefore an environment in which an experimental approach can provide insights that would be otherwise unavailable.      The project consists of a series of experiments designed to study how firms reach collusive agreements.  It focuses on the role of explicit communication between experimental subjects for this purpose and seeks to identify the features of communication that help foster collusion. All treatments start with an initial phase where no communication is available.  A second phase then follows where communication is allowed.  The treatments vary in the type of communication that is allowed for this second phase. The study's fundamental question is whether explicit communication is essential for achieving collusion. Expanding on this theme, the experimental design explores numerous questions about what features of communication matter most for reaching collusive outcomes:    *  Theory suggests that messages need to communicate contingent strategies, but will simpler messages that are only about current prices or quantities suffice?    *  If only a small number of subjects can initially follow effective strategies for collusion, do their interactions with other subjects ""infect"" the rest of the population and lead to widespread collusion?  *  Do some individuals systematically use communication for deceptive purposes? Can this undermine the ability of 'honest' players to achieve collusive agreements?   *  Does allowing the possibility of communication to renegotiate limit the effectiveness of contingent messages?    *  How does complexity affect the relationship between communication and collusion?   *  Can a policy that that imperfectly targets and punishes communications about prices as in real anti-trust enforcement effectively reduce the incidence of collusion?    Broader Impact:  The results of this project have important implications for anti-trust policy.  Understanding how collusion arises makes it easier to determine where scarce enforcement resources should be focused and which market characteristics should be considered relevant for the assessment of coordinated effects analysis in mergers. Some of our treatments involve analyzing the content of subject's messages to determine what specific phrases are likely to yield collusive agreements.  In particular, our experiments allow us to determine whether targeting enforcement on finding these types of messages can effectively combat collusion. The results of the study can also inform policy towards information exchange agreements between firms by helping to delineate the boundary between legitimate business activity and anticompetitive behavior.",Kai-Uwe Kuhn|

This expected shortage is not so much due to the scarcity of bandwidth, but due to its inefficient use.  There exist plenty of ``opportunities"" available along time and frequency dimensions that wireless networks can potentially exploit. It is therefore important to develop a new way of exploiting these opportunities effectively and efficiently.     Recent technological advances make it possible to realize SDRs (Software-Defined Radios) or smart radios that, unlike traditional radios, can switch from one frequency to another at minimum cost, thereby enabling ''opportunistic'' spectrum access along time and frequency dimensions.  SDRs empower next-generation wireless networks with adaptive and dynamic multi-band access, but introduce several unique cross-layer challenges. On the other hand, the newly-emerging MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) technology has great potential for significant throughput enhancements, better interference suppression, and substantial energy savings. SDRs and MIMOs together form a complete means of enabling opportunistic spectrum access along not only time and frequency dimensions (via SDR), but also space dimension (via MIMO).     This project will, therefore,  1. Model, characterize, and analyze the maximum achievable throughput in MIMO-equipped wireless networks;  2. Derive guidelines for network designers to determine the optimal parameters of wireless networks;  3. Develop innovative techniques that exploit MIMO to reliably support and maintain QoS in MIMO wireless networks; and  4.

The main objectives of these studies are to develop a nondestructive methodology capable of accurately determining the micro-structural damage evolution and/or failure mechanisms of engineering materials, to provide a critical linkage between micro/meso and macroscale damage mechanisms, and to develop innovative algorithms for damage assessment of engineering structures through the proposed measurement system.      The outcome of the ongoing research activities will lead to: 1) a potential breakthrough in understanding the damage evolution through failure process of engineering materials by measuring and analyzing spatial micro/mesoscale crack growth in complete and continuous loading processes without the need to unload and dissect material specimens; 2) possible coalesce of micro/mesoscale crack growth patterns and damage mechanics; and 3) an accurate way for the damage assessment and residual life prediction of engineering structures under service conditions through spatial fracture crack signatures. The proposed nondestructive measurement system will substantially strengthen the research infrastructure at UM-D and will also significantly improve the education quality at UM-D through undergraduate student design projects and research training.

This semi-structured feature-based goal is different from simple nesting of higher resolution gridding of vortex cores. Suggested approaches which will be explored to answer these questions include comparing and blending well-established numerical algorithms, such as finite volume and vortex blob methods, along with radial basis function schemes, tree codes and less well explored hybridizations of these.

A cell-specific transcript profiling method has been used to define a set of root epidermis genes, and these are being assembled into a probabilistic network by systematically perturbing specific genes (nodes) and defining independence relationships from gene expression data using Bayesian network analysis.  This network will be refined and tested by resolving uncertain parts of the network and by probing specific relationships using molecular, genetic, and biochemical experiments.  The project is expected to provide new computational and experimental tools for gene network construction in Arabidopsis and to uncover fundamental features of plant gene network structure and circuitry.

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research"" competition. This project is led by the University of Michigan and includes subawards to Merrimack College and Purdue University. This project will utilize the NEES lifeline experimental facilities at Cornell University. The assessment of damage to lifelines after natural disasters, such as earthquakes, is a crucial component of emergency response and rescue efforts. Of particular importance is the water supply system, as water is an important survival resource. Even minor damage to water pipelines can result in contamination and epidemic outbreaks. Water is transmitted in concrete and metal pipes, which are vulnerable to damage caused by ground motions; it is proposed that damage detection methods be devised for both kinds of pipes. Quick assessment of the integrity of these pipelines is necessary for first planning the recovery mission and subsequent infrastructure reconstruction. The long-term monitoring of the structural health of pipelines is also an important component of infrastructure maintenance. A challenge in damage assessment to lifelines is in the fact that most pipelines are buried in soil. This proposal will develop methods for the detection of damage to concrete and metal pipelines caused by permanent ground displacement. It is envisioned that future lifelines will be smart structures built of materials with self-sensing capabilities, and wireless techniques will be used to transmit the information-carrying signal to the ground surface. The research proposed has three components: soil-structure interaction of pipelines subjected to ground movement, material research and design (particularly self-sensing concrete), and information technology focused on data gathering, processing and transfer. The broad impacts of this research on society will come through increased capabilities of damage assessment to lifelines after natural disasters, and through better long-term health monitoring methods. A unique aspect of this project is the involvement of the project team in an outreach program through the Hands-On Museum in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the Sciencenter in Ithaca, New York, where a young audience can be directly reached and educated on the issues of engineering and the nation's infrastructure. Data from this project will be made available through the NEES data repository (http://www.nees.org).",Radoslaw Michalowski|W. Jason Weiss|Russell Green|Jerome Lynch|Aaron Bradshaw

How plate tectonic processes of mountain building and mountain erosion by surface processes interact to produce topography over millions of years is now at the forefront of Earth science research. A fundamental question that arises when studying the evolution of mountains is: what did the past topography of mountain ranges look like? This question has proven very difficult to answer. Recent developments in both computer modeling of mountain building and erosional processes, and developments in geochemistry have made progress in reconstructing paleotopography. Advances in new geochemical techniques and mathematics (inverse problem theory) now allow a means of testing computer model predictions with geochemical (thermochronometer) data from rocks exposed at the Earth's surface today. These data record the cooling history of rocks as they are exhumed to the surface by erosion and faulting. This interdisciplinary project is addressing questions and hypotheses that are fundamental to quantifying the evolution of mountain topography including: (1) How can geologically meaningful interpretations of tectonic and geomorphic processes influencing mountain topography be improved from an integration of thermochronometer data, computer modeling, and mathematics? (2) How sensitive are thermochronometer data to different mountain building and erosional processes and how can sampling strategies be optimized to improve interpretations? and (3) What is the magnitude and rate of topographic change that can be resolved from mathematical inversion of thermochronometer data?      To address these questions, this project investigates the forward and inverse problems of mountain topographic evolution with a comprehensive model. Coupled 3D thermal, hydrologic, and kinematic computer models are under development in addition to a surface process model accounting for glacial, fluvial, and hillslope erosional processes. The coupled model is used to explore the sensitivity of thermochronometer data to different processes and mathematically invert a dense network of new and existing thermochronometer samples from the southern Coast Mountains, B.C., for the regional paleotopography. Field work is in progress for the collection of additional data. Several novel mathematical techniques are also under development. In particular, a low pass filter technique and a regularized iterative method are being used to solve the notoriously ill-posed backward parabolic equation and large scale, nonlinear inverse heat transport equation.  These problems are by nature interdisciplinary and in the forefront of predicting and interpreting thermochronometer data and mountain topography.",Todd Ehlers|Peijun Li

In recent years, as patents have become central to innovation processes that are considered integral to the health of national and regional economies, the patent system has also become a major forum for clashes over many pressing global public policy issues. At street protests against the World Trade Organization, in meeting rooms at the European Patent Office, and many places in between, critics are demanding that intellectual property regimes must change to take into account the ethical and social implications of their decisions, including the consequences of trade liberalization for the developing world, the rights of citizens to affordable health care, the commodification of life and ethical boundaries of markets, and the limits of free scientific inquiry. Defenders of the status quo, meanwhile, argue that the patent office is not an appropriate venue for such questions; it is a space where inventors are given a right to exclude others from manufacturing an invention, and has no control over whether or how an invention is actually used. This project addresses whether and how political context influences the shape and substance of these challenges, the implications of these challenges for the status and legitimacy of patent offices, and whether and how patent offices can be structured to address these concerns. The investigator poses the following questions:     1) How do the shapes of these debates vary between the United States and Europe? Do they vary in terms of their themes, their participants, and the winners and losers?     2) If these debates vary, then why? Can these differences be explained in terms of political structures or cultures, or in the context of the broader battles over biotechnology and intellectual property rights that are occurring in both contexts?    3) How do the participants in these debates envision the patent office''s role, in terms of knowledge production, its jurisdiction (national, regional, or global), the relationship between science and markets, and the configuration of social and moral orders?    4) What alternative methods are critics proposing to incorporate ethical and social considerations into patent office deliberations? Are any of these politically, economically, and socially feasible?    5) Can the politics in this domain teach us anything about whether and how we can incorporate ethical or social concerns into science and technology policymaking in other contexts?    The investigator addresses these questions by using qualitative research methods, including interviews, ethnographic observation, and document analysis. In addition to characterizing, in a broad sense, the biotechnology patenting debates that have occurred over the past 30 years, the investigator organizes the analysis by focusing on controversies over four types of biotechnology patents that cover the breadth of issues that are being debated in this arena. The investigator will choose among patents covering human embryonic stem cells, disease genes, higher life forms including animals, indigenous knowledge, and genetically modified organisms.     This study is relevant to scholarship in the fields of science and technology studies, bioethics, and public policy. It contributes to the growing body of research on the comparative politics of biotechnology, and it also facilitates our understanding of the shape, politics, and stability of organizations that operate in the world of science and technology policy. Furthermore, the project provides insight into whether and how ethical and social concerns can be incorporated into both patent policy and science and technology policy in other contexts.",Shobita Parthasarathy|

Phase noise of the oscillators limits the performance of the RF and microwave transceivers.  Phase noise of the local oscillator in a radio receiver down converts the adjacent channels into intermediate frequency thereby limiting receiver's immunity to nearby interference and jamming.  Phase noise of local oscillator in a transmitter corrupts the information carried in the phase of the carrier.  In a radio transmitter phase noise can also overwhelm the nearby weak channels. Since the number of wireless subscribers and thus, the amount of RF interference continue to increase, modern communication standards demand excellent phase noise performance from local oscillators in transceivers.  Within this project several new circuit approaches for the design of integrated low phase noise microwave and millimeter wave oscillators are proposed. This project can also opens potential avenues for the design of other type circuits like high performance active filters.    Broader Impacts: Any advancement in the design of simple and low phase noise oscillators will help to improve the overall communication systems performance and can relieve the stringent requirement on the other transceiver blocks.

Occasionally, experimental mutation leads to a dramatic deficit, thereby providing insight into fundamental organizational principles.  Mutation of the TRMP-7 gene results in a loss of motility in zebrafish.  This loss appears to be due to a deficit in the ability of sensory neurons to respond to touch stimuli.  The TRMP-7 gene encodes a protein that forms part of an ion channel whose failure to operate results in a dramatic behavioral phenotype.    This project will focus upon understanding how this channel works to ensure proper development and operation of motor circuits by combining molecular biological and electrophysiological techniques.  Specific aims include identification of neurons that have the TRMP7 protein, analysis of differences in neural circuitry between normal and mutant zebrafish, and functional analysis of different domains of the TRMP-7 gene.  Studying the mechanisms underlying the dramatic behavioral changes caused by mutation of this single gene in the relatively simple nervous system of the zebrafish will very likely provide insight into fundamental genetic and neuronal mechanism found throughout the animal kingdom.

For example, a stoplight turning green might automatically elicit the response of stepping on the gas pedal to move forward.  However, you must change that response if we see a child entering the intersection, or if your goal is to make a left turn.  Failures to control behavior in these ways can have important consequences.  Research with humans and other primates shows that a network of brain regions including frontal and parietal cortex is important for the cognitive control of behavior.  Research with rodents shows that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is an important chemical messenger used by the brain in situations that require control.  With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Lustig will use pharmacological fMRI to integrate these two lines of research and establish how acetylcholine influences cognitive control functions in the human brain.  Participants will take one of three doses (placebo, low dose, high dose) of a drug that increases acetylcholine's action in the brain by slowing the rate at which it is broken down.  They will then undergo functional brain imaging while performing tasks that make low or high demands for the cognitive control of behavior in response to changing environmental cues.  The results will answer several important questions about how acetylcholine acts in the human brain to influence the control of behavior.  First, they will show which parts of the human frontal-parietal control network are specifically influenced by acetylcholine.  Second, they will show whether all aspects of performance are influenced by increased cholinergic function, or only those that make high demands for cognitive control.  Third, they will clarify whether acetylcholine has its effects by increasing the engagement of control-related brain regions or by helping those brain regions to act more efficiently.  The project also compares several different methods of analyzing pharmacological fMRI data to determine which may be best for future studies examining how different drugs influence brain function.    This work will help us better understand how the human brain allows us to control and change our behavior in order to accomplish our goals.  This ability improves as children mature into adults, and is disrupted in many clinical disorders or when normal adults are stressed or fatigued.  The project will help to integrate human and animal research, and to improve the technology by which scientists study the action of drugs on the brain.  Dr. Lustig's research team actively involves both graduate and undergraduate students.  The laboratory specifically targets the inclusion of students from under-represented groups, recruiting from synergistic NSF programs such as the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program.  As part of their experience in the lab, students receive training in experimental methods, brain anatomy, and the fundamentals of fMRI.

Using in-formation from these sensors, the research will investigate how the proposed system can acquire visual field data via an attached camera and georeference it with computer simulated images in real time. Meth-odologies will then be explored to allow on-site users to superimpose previously stored building informa-tion onto the corresponding view of a real structure in an AR setting and estimate building damage by evaluating the discrepancy between the two views. Techniques will be proposed to permit field users to compute damage indices from the measured differences so that critical decisions about a building's structural integrity and safety can be rapidly made. Furthermore, the research will pursue how feedback information from the actual view of a building can permit users to update structural analysis models and conduct fast-running simulations to explore how a building might collapse if critical structural members fail.     The proposed technology will deliver unprecedented capabilities to building inspectors and first respond-ers evaluating damage in the aftermath of catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks and earthquakes in urban areas. In addition, by increasing the speed and accuracy with which building damage may be as-sessed in the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters, the reconnaissance technology developed in this project will provide cost savings and reduce potential hazards and hardships to citizens.

The excavation data from Ak'awillay will be used to evaluate the impact of an empire on households, specifically the impact of Wari imperial expansion on a local community.      From AD 600 to 1000, the Wari Empire established several administrative centers across the central Andes.  In the Cusco area, earlier archaeologists focused on two large Wari centers and they concluded that Wari controlled the Cusco area during this period.  Systematic surveys have demonstrated the absence of Wari architecture at other sites, although Wari ceramics were present at a small number of local settlements.      This new project will take a complementary ""bottom-up"" perspective that looks at a smaller community (1) to evaluate the impact of imperial expansion on the local population and (2) to refine what is known about Wari expansion and its strategies of incorporation.      Empires, including that of the Wari, tend to use a variety of strategies to incorporate and interact with local communities that may resist, rebel, or cooperate.  The impact of imperial expansion can be profound in some regions of an empire but not others, or experienced only by certain segments of local societies.  By taking a detailed view of a single community in the Cusco area, this research will examine what changes, if any, were experienced at the household level - from family to family - after Wari expansion reached the Cusco region.  These excavations will complement earlier studies that focused on two larger Wari centers, and add to the historical and ethnohistorical research on empires by developing archaeological signatures for the identification of imperial expansion.      Ak'awillay - the focus of the project - was occupied in the pre-Wari period, but it was only during the Wari period that it became the largest settlement in the area.  Excavations will yield data that will be used to compare pre-Wari households to Wari-period households, as well as activities and artifact inventories.  With these data it will be possible to evaluate whether Wari's impact on local households was minimal, substantial, or restricted to certain households and/or activities.      In addition to sharing the results of this research widely with the scientific community, regular sessions will be organized with the people of the modern Quechua-speaking community of Ak'awillay to help them learn about their past and how to protect and preserve their archaeological site.  This project will provide work for several members of the local community (both women and men) in an area where income and paying jobs are hard to find.  It will also give Peruvian and North American scholars and archaeologists an opportunity to gain experience in excavation and laboratory work, leading to their own degrees and professional advancement.       Since expansionist states also characterize the modern world, this archaeological project - showing how ancient states expanded, incorporated, and controlled local territories - will be relevant to understanding the process of modern political expansion.",Joyce Marcus|

Multi-stranded SMA wires offer a convenient and cost-effective way to scale up the excellent properties of SMA wire to larger structures, but their structural behavior and scaling have not been studied in the open literature. Compared to conventional steel cable, SMA cable would have adaptive properties, i.e. thermally active in a shape memory mode and extremely resilient/dissipative in a superelastic mode. Compared to monolithic SMA bars, SMA cables would have other advantages, including: (1) more bending/torsion flexibility, which could lead to improved fatigue performance in some applications, (2) a reduced thermal lag, since the effective surface area for heat transfer would be larger for the same material mass, and (3) load carrying redundancy, leading to more graceful failure modes, less sensitivity to defects and mishandling, and better reliability. A systematic study of the thermo-mechanical behavior of SMA cables will be conducted. A hierarchy of prototype specimens (helical wires, strands, and cables) fabricated from NiTi wires will be subjected to a series of experiments over a range of temperatures and loading histories. The response of SMA cables will be compared to that of solid SMA bars and that of conventional steel cables to demonstrate their advantages and limitations. A numerical simulation tool will be developed to study the sensitivities of the behavior to geometric parameters and size of the cable. An improved recoverable strain response in shape memory and superelastic modes as well as improved response time due to reduced thermal lag will be demonstrated. SMA cables may exhibit unusual and interesting physical phenomena due to latent heat ""cross-talk"" between the wires/strands. They should also exhibit unusual dynamic behavior under impact loads and cyclic disturbances, and this work lays the necessary groundwork for future study of dynamical behavior.     The funding will be used to support a doctoral student who will use the proposed research as the basis for a Ph.D. dissertation. A continuing effort will be made to involve undergraduates in the proposed work, via summer internships and independent study projects.

Principal investigator, William Axinn of the University of Michigan and colleagues from Michigan State University, San Diego State University, the University of North Carolina, and Arizona State University will collaborate with Nepalese partners from the Institute for Social and Environmental Research and Tribhuvan University's Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science, and with Chinese partners from the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Wolong Nature Reserve.  The field sites in Nepal and China are two high-profile settings where large, growing populations, rapidly changing economies, unique biodiversity and complex institutional structures offer exceptional research and educational opportunities.    The five-year plan for collaborative research focuses on improving understanding of patterns and processes affecting vegetation and habitats for three endangered species (pandas, rhinos, and tigers), achieving cross-case comparisons of the dynamics of population-environment interaction for Nepal and China, and establishing widely applicable tools needed to make such comparisons in other settings.  The educational objectives of the collaboration will draw upon the intellectual and physical resources of each partner to train a next generation of scientists skilled in conducting new international cross-case comparisons of the human-environment interaction.  This activity provides a unique international research and training experience for forty U.S. graduate and twelve undergraduate students.  Educational and research activities are closely integrated with a focus on learning and practicing concepts and methods needed to bridge key disciplines and foster international collaboration while pursuing compelling research questions.      Detailed single site case studies that provide micro-level information have greatly advanced knowledge about human-environment interaction, but cross-case comparison is now an extremely high scientific priority needed for better understanding of global environmental change.  Specifically, the strengths of the Nepal case study, which is rich in dynamic measurements of community context will be applied to the China case study.  Likewise, the strengths of the China case study, the analysis of remote sensing data and agent-based modeling to study forest and habitat dynamics, will be applied to the Nepal study.  The integration will increase the comparability of data and methods across these important cases and the cross-fertilization of research among different case studies will enhance the value of each case study.  More importantly, this work will enable the comparative study of human-environment interaction that pushes the field past singular case studies toward multilateral research designs.      This project has the potential to greatly accelerate investigation of important environmental change, ultimately helping to identify effective strategies for preserving biodiversity.  The  findings are expected to identify models of studying human-environment interaction that transfer across settings to link various studies in a mutually beneficial manner. Further, this project will train a new generation of scientists pioneering international cross-case comparisons of population-environment interactions.

The bi-annual Group conferences, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, are a leading forum for the presentation and discussion of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) research and practice.  They are attended by approximately 120 CSCW, HCI, and allied Computer Science, Information Science, and Information Technology researchers and professionals, and the conference proceedings are heavily-refereed and widely cited.  The Doctoral Consortium at Group07 will take place on November 4, 2007, with a follow-up poster session to be held during the conference's technical program on November 6, and a wrap-up analysis and summary session for the doctoral consortium students on November 7.  This is a new doctoral consortium, but similar consortia have taken place at the CSCW conference since 1992 (the most recent of them sponsored in part by NSF), and have helped to launch the careers of many fine CSCW researchers.  The goals of the event are to build a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues, to guide the work of the new researchers by having the experts in the research field give advice, to provide encouragement and support for the selection of Group research topics, to make it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference, to illustrate the interrelationship and diversity of Group research, and to make the new entrants' experience at the Group conference an enjoyable and rewarding  one, thereby encouraging them to return in the future and submit papers, panels, demonstrations, posters, etc.  During the full day of the Consortium, each student will make a formal presentation about his/her doctoral research.  Feedback will be provided by each member of the faculty panel, as well as by the other student participants, and will help student participants understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented, etc.  Students will have an opportunity to interact more informally with the faculty (and additional guests) during lunch and dinner on the Consortium day.  The poster session scheduled for the second day of the technical program will afford student participants a chance to present their work to conference attendees in general.  The organizers of the Consortium will make a special effort to attract participants from under-represented communities, and to reach beyond the traditional CSCW research community.  NSF funding will provide support for the domestic travel and lodging of the students, as well as the direct expenses of putting on the event.    Broader Impacts:  The Group07 Doctoral Consortium will bring together the best of the next generation of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work researchers. The event will allow them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, and this will play a major role in their enculturation into the profession.  Since the students and faculty will constitute a diverse group along several dimensions, the students' horizons will be broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.",Thomas Finholt|

Clay-bearing fault rocks are common in exhumed fault zones, which typically preserve both primary (detrital) and newly-grown (authigenic) phyllosilicates. Analysis of these fault rocks, therefore, reflects a mixture of the roles of both mineral populations. Using X-ray characterization of grain size populations in the clay fraction, and sample encapsulation for irradiation and dating by the Ar/Ar method, a reliable approach to dating authigenic growth of illite- and illite-smectite-rich materials to track the timing of faulting has been developed.  This project uses phylosilicate polytype characterization and quantification, and applies the dating method to test existing hypotheses in well-known normal fault settings in the western US Cordillera.  The method will be applied to core complex faulting problems, with a view toward solving long standing problems in this field of structural geology.  Questions such as regional timing of deformation, concurrent displacement on steep and shallow brittle faults and time gap between brittle and plastic deformation can be answered if the approach is successful.  A protocol for sampling of K-rich fault zone materials will be created, including the full characterization and dating of clay gouge, an exciting new area of research that is virtually unexplored.    The public in the US understands that there are many faults that wind their way across the landscape, one of the most famous being the San Andreas Fault in California.  The importance of such Earth features to the public increases if the faults are actively moving due to the potential damage they might cause.  The faults can be serious hazards if they cross urban or suburban areas.  There are few ways to probe the history of activity on faults, yet the work outlined in this proposal promises to do just that:  Measure the history of some test case faults in the western US.  The approach is in principle simple.  Minerals that have growth during fault movements are collected and purified, and then their radiometric age is measured.  The measured age of the bulk material is that of the collective history of fault movement, and the different mineral subtypes within the sample may contain additional chemical clues that help to further decipher that collective history.",Ben van der Pluijm|

Estimates based on paleoclimate and thermochronometer data are consistent with formation of a plateau of modern width by about 13 million years ago. In contrast estimates based on stable isotope paleoaltimetry, a relatively new technique that employs the oxygen isotope concentration (delta-18O) of ancient soil carbonates to infer past elevation change, suggest a rapid uplift about 10 to 7 million years ago. Isotope paleoaltimetry is a promising new tool for quantifying elevation change, but several outstanding issues may complicate its interpretation. In particular, changes over the last 40 million years in surface temperature, atmospheric circulation, precipitation rate, and vapor source may affect the oxygen isotopic concentration of ancient soil carbonates. If substantial, these effects could compromise paleoelevation inferences based on the isotopes The objective of this project is to evaluate the processes that control delta-18O of precipitation in the Andes and to test the hypothesis that Andean Plateau uplift was in fact steady over the last 20 million years. The apparent rapid rise of the plateau in the late Miocene may be an artifact of changes in Cenozoic climate and atmospheric circulation that caused depletion of Andean precipitation 18O. Global and regional climate models with the capability to predict oxygen and deuterium isotope transport and fractionation provide a tool for quantifying these effects over the Andean Plateau. However, before these models can be used with any confidence, they must be validated against modern observations of oxygen isotopes in precipitation, which are currently sparsely available in the Andes. In this project, a multi-year sampling campaign across central Peru and southern Bolivia measures monthly variations in the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation. These data, when integrated with existing measurements, meteorological data, and backtracking analyses will provide critical data for assessing climate model predictions of precipitation oxygen isotopic composition and evaluate whether a Rayleigh law adequately predicts isotope fractionation on the Andes. The validated regional and global climate models are used to predict past changes in Andean delta-18O composition and to assess the influence of past climate changes on precipitation delta-18O used in soil carbonates for paleoaltimetry studies.    The Andean Plateau is one of the most dramatic topographic features on Earth. Despite its impressive nature, the mechanisms and rates of its formation remain poorly understood. A range of competing geodynamic models have been proposed to explain the formation of plateaus. To distinguish between these models it is necessary to understand the deformation and erosion history associated with the plateau and its marginal thrust belts, the present day crustal and lithospheric structure, and the paleoelevation history of the plateau. Of these, current understanding of Andean paleoelevation is arguably the most uncertain, and yet offers great insights into the formation of the plateau. The paleoelevation history can be used to make inferences about the rate and timing of mountain building, and ultimately the geodynamic processes that govern mountain building. The results of this project will provide an important evaluation of the isotope paleoaltimetry technique and provide improved calculations of the surface uplift history of the Andean Plateau.",Todd Ehlers|Christopher Poulsen

The proposal takes advantage of the fact that tribal communities are increasingly gaining control over their artifacts, giving them the ability to determine which stories are told regarding their history and culture, and to determine how they are represented.  Building a physical museum can be an expensive task, however, and digital museums could be a more affordable first step for many tribes. Unfortunately, American Indians are profoundly underrepresented in both the computing and broader cultural heritage fields, and most tribal members do not have the computing skills necessary to build and maintain a digital museum. This proposal seeks to address the lack of computing education in Indian Country by developing a program that is pedagogically effective with a curriculum that is culturally relevant. The project will demonstrate that American Indians can be engaged in computing through experience in developing software systems to meet local interests and needs. The goal of the project is to generate interest in Computer Science and Information academic tracks among American Indians while at the same time having students build IT- based cultural heritage systems that will garner respect and enthusiasm from their peers and local communities.

Papaefthymiou  University of Michigan    Intellectual Merit  The continuing scaling of semiconductor process technology brings about new challenges in the design  of VLSI systems, while at the same time motivating new approaches for addressing them. Power density in  high-end integrated systems has already reached performance-limiting levels. Increased device variability  results in greater delay uncertainty, dictating the use of larger design margins and further limiting performance.  Yet, silicon per device continues to decrease at exponential rates, enabling novel uses of silicon  area.  This research project will investigate next-generation design technologies for the realization of nanoscale VLSI systems in silicon. Specifically, this project will focus on the exploration of so-called charge recovery design technologies that enable operation at new levels of power-efficiency while reducing uncertainty due to device variability. In conventional VLSI design, capacitors are switched abruptly between supply and ground, experiencing high peak currents and dissipating all their stored energy as heat across resistive devices. Furthermore, device variability leads to significant uncertainty in the clock arrival times of conventional distribution networks with buffers. In contrast to conventional integrated systems, charge-recovery designs switch capacitors gradually, maintaining low peak currents and returning any undissipated energy back to the power supply. Therefore, charge-recovery designs can potentially lead to substantial reductions in switching power and gate leakage. Moreover, since they rely on buffer-less resonant clock distribution networks, charge-recovery designs are also expected to yield substantial reductions in clock delay uncertainty.  The significant potential of charge recovery has so far remained untapped, as it represents a departure from established design practices. The main objective of this project is to explore and assess the potential of charge-recovery technologies, including circuitry, design methodologies, and computing architectures for realizing nanoscale silicon-based VLSI systems with unprecedented levels of power efficiency and performance.   Broader Impacts  The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the realization of next-generation VLSI  systems, promoting discovery, teaching, and learning in novel design technologies that address key issues in  nanoscale process nodes. Broader outcomes of the proposed effort include the integration of research activities  into graduate-level courses, the development of lectures and projects for advanced undergraduate-level  courses, as well as the direct involvement of electrical engineering and computer science majors through  senior-level design projects. Consistent with the PI's proven record in promoting broad participation, the  proposed research and education activities will include participants from underrepresented groups.

Second will be the introduction of more highly conjugated substituents at all cube vertices and at the internal double bond. Later, still more complex conjugated systems will be added.

What is the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking?  Disentangling the answers to these questions will be a decade-long program requiring cooperation between theorists and experimentalists.

This includes tracking m brightest blips in a RADAR image or the m most prominent features in a Magentic Resonance image.  Many communities, including the theoretical computer science community, have addressed these problems.  The theoretical computer science community's principled approach to randomness and approximation in algorithms leads to solutions that are remarkably more efficient than traditional approaches, especially when the size d of the problem is large, as is the case in many RADAR and medical imaging problems.  But, despite the tremendous promise of theoretical advances, to date there has been little dramatic impact on the way massive datasets are handled in practice.  For many massive dataset algorithms, the new algorithms are exponentially faster than classical algorithms in important respects.  Exponentially algorithms will eventually, of necessity, replace existing algorithms.    This project addresses massive dataset issues that arise in RADAR or medical imaging.  It brings theoretical advances in sparse recovery to those fields through collaboration between theoretical computer scientists and engineers.",Martin Strauss|

A major challenge in the field of developmental biology is to understand how distinct cell types arise in appropriate patterns.  This project will address this issue by using root epidermis development in Arabidopsis as a simple model.  In prior work, a new receptor (named SCRAMBLED (SCM)) was found to play a critical role in enabling developing epidermal cells to interpret their position relative to the underlying root cells. A working model was proposed whereby the SCM receptor influences a network of transcriptional regulators in a position-dependent manner to generate the observed cell-type pattern in the root epidermis. In this research project, this model will be tested by analyzing the accumulation and the specific function of the SCM receptor using molecular and genetic methods.  In addition, new genes that are likely to act in a SCM-related manner will be identified in a genetic screen and in a differential expression-based microarray screen. The research results are expected to provide exciting new insights into the molecular regulation of cell specification and pattern formation during the development of multicellular organisms.  Further, this project will have a broader impact in several areas.  It will provide educational opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral students in modern biological research.  The project will also provide information and educational material to the Arabidopsis research community and the general public, via a website (http://www.mcdb.lsa.umich.edu/labs/schiefel/index.html).

Understanding how a bacterial cell is structured requires knowing where proteins are positioned and how every protein interacts with its specific binding partner(s).  Historically, most knowledge on the spatial localization of specific proteins and the identification of their partners has occurred through focused studies by many individual laboratories.  The decoding of the DNA sequences of bacteria has allowed for high throughput efforts to define the spatial relationships in bacterial cells.  Moreover, having these DNA sequences in hand has allowed dedicated efforts by several labs to generate comprehensive tools available to all researchers.  This study will take advantage of these existing resources and will utilize them in novel ways to achieve two goals.  Based upon the principle that mini cells, because of their defective polar restriction formation, are enriched for proteins that are naturally targeted to the poles and the septum, this project will use mini cells to identify proteins that localize to the poles or the septum of cells.  First, new proteins that localize to cell poles or to midcells will be identified by using high throughput methods.  The interrelationships between proteins that are similarly localized will be determined as will the identity of their binding partners.  Second, an existing protein fusion library will be used in a novel manner to identify new binding partners and to identify polar proteins.  The goals of this project are to generate a large new microbial cellular organization dataset and to make these data available to the scientific community.  Results from this study will impact current understanding of cellular organization and structure.    Broader Impact  The broader impact of these studies is twofold.  First, because of the broad and comprehensive nature of this project, results from this research will have significant and immediate impact on current understanding of the bacterial cell, both at the level of protein-protein interactions and at the level of spatial organization.  This will be an invaluable resource to the microbiology community.  Second, this project will result in the training of several students (graduate and undergraduate) in an interdisciplinary study.  These students will have the unique opportunity to gain experiences in molecular genetics, cell biology and proteomics.  Training of students and postdoctoral fellows from a wide range of backgrounds is a high priority during these studies and supports NSF emphases on teaching, training, and outreach.",Janine Maddock|

Materials for electrochemical systems are highly complex composites because they must perform multiple functions such as facilitating transport of different species and providing sites for chemical reactions. The study is challenging due to the coupling of very different physics -- electrochemistry, transport and microstructure. The problem is fundamentally 3D; that is, 2D studies cannot capture the underlying connectivity that determines the properties and performance of these materials.  The project is interdisciplinary, with elements from computer science and mathematics that enable large-scale simulations and visualizations, as well as elements of materials science and physics that provide proper models and scientific insights.  At the core of the approach is the integration of 3D and Virtual Reality visualization methods with 3D materials science. The project will utilize the Virtual Reality CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Reality Environment) at the University of Michigan. Both visualization and simulations will involve development and application of cyberinfrastructure.  The education component focuses on outreach to children at the elementary through junior high school level at predominantly minority public schools will involve 3D visualization and animation in order to foster interest and understanding in materials science. Teaching activities will involve active learning of math and computations within materials science and engineering curriculum. Evaluation of the outreach and teaching programs will be performed and analyzed under the guidance of the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching at the University of Michigan. The tools, educational materials, and experience will use materials research community cyberinfrastructure to reach a broad audience throughout the world.    NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This CAREER award supports integrated computational research and education on the properties of materials that have applications or potential applications to electrochemical storage. The research will focus on how properties derive from the structure of the material on length scales longer than the atomic length scale but shorter than macroscopic length scales. Structure on this scale is known as microstructure. The research will combine methods from computer science and mathematics that enable large-scale simulations and visualizations, as well as methods of materials science and physics that provide proper models and scientific insights. The combination of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of microstructures and computational materials science is a powerful tool that provides insight into materials processing and properties. However, this emerging field faces a major challenge in the analysis and interpretation of of generally complicated 3D microstructures. The research will address fundamental questions regarding the coupling between microstructures and electrochemistry, and will provide insights into 3D microstructures of batteries and other electrochemical components that have been optimized for performance and resistance to degradation.  The scientific findings are expected to have impact on future battery technologies, as well as contributing to the more general understanding of the relationship between microstructure and materials properties. Computational tools developed to interpret complex sets of data may facilitate scientific research within the broader materials-research community and beyond. This award contributes both to the use of computation for scientific discovery and to the cyberinfrastructure of the materials research community.

Manufacturers and design houses alike strive to validate and verify their designs as much as possible during system development, and then attempt to contain the impact of escaped bugs through publicly available errata reports. Some escaped bugs are innocuous, and can be easily overcome through a BIOS or OS update, but still others are potentially dangerous to the users of the system, or they might compromise its security and adversely affect its performance.    This project focuses on developing integrated hardware and software solutions to guarantee that a processor chip operates correctly, even if its design is flawed. The key idea driving this research is to create two modes of operation for the processor: a complex high-performance mode to be used when executing within the portion of the system that has been verified at design time, and a simple low-performance mode guaranteed to be correct under all execution scenarios.  By carefully selecting the appropriate mode of operation at runtime, it is possible to always execute correctly: in high-performance when the operation is one that has been verified at design-time or in low performance otherwise. In addition, because of the extreme simplicity of the low-performance  mode, it is possible to guarantee that this mode of operation always provides correct results but at a performance price. Related research has shown that, in practice, the low-performance mode intervenes only in very rare occasions, making its performance impact negligible overall.  The research challenges to be undertaken in this project include devising low-cost mechanisms to select execution between fast and correct mode, developing the simple mode of operation in such a way that can be fully verified, and developing techniques to efficiently encode the correct states of operation.",Valeria Bertacco|

The proposed methodology will scale to multiple  heterogeneous vehicles, allow for extended exploration over long time  durations and over multiple spatial scales, and be robust to the  challenging limitations of the underwater environment. Many land/air  SLAM methods are largely inapplicable underwater because of (a) a lack  of point features of unstructured seafloor, and (b) the rapid  attenuation of electromagnetic, optical, and acoustic radiation in  comparison to land, air, and space.  The proposed multi-vehicle  multi-scalar SLAM navigation framework overcomes these challenges by  fusing information from three disparate technologies: 1) real-time  vision-based seafloor navigation, 2) inertial navigation systems, and  3) acoustic modem-based communication, to create a flexible navigation  framework that allows for inter-nodal ranging and data sharing among  heterogeneous nodes.

For example, what kinds of genes are involved in speciation?  Are there few genes of major effect or many genes of small effect?  These questions will be addressed by studying gene flow across a larger number of molecular markers in naturally occurring hybrid populations of two genetically well characterized house mouse species, Mus musculus and Mus domesticus, and through functional analyses of laboratory crosses between them.  The goals of the research are to identify the number and characterize the biological function of genes contributing to speciation in house mice.

As our lives are increasingly conducted in the digital domain, these online activities represent a growing proportion of our interactions - from the way we acquire and share information, to the way we communicate, socialize, and organize. Such activities leave digital traces, ranging from citation patterns among millions of blogs to avatar interactions in online virtual worlds such as Second Life.     Empirical studies of these traces will address the following information diffusion and social network phenomena on an unprecedented scale and with great accuracy: 1) the interplay between social network structure, community affiliation and interaction; 2) the effect of social network structure and community boundaries on information diffusion and change; 3) the range of influence of individuals, related to the structure of their social network and community affiliation; 4) the dynamics of opinion formation in networks of overlapping communities.     The topic of information diffusion, having both theoretical and practical significance, has received sustained attention across several scientific disciplines for some time. However, past empirical studies have lacked the size and accuracy needed to differentiate between different theoretical models. To address this problem, this project will assemble three very large scale, high resolution network data sources: one encompassing the interactions of millions of users of the online virtual world Second Life, the second comprising millions of blogs, and the third mapping exact traces with a novel information and opinion sharing application that will be developed. Together, these three contexts will serve as a testbed for modeling the dynamics of information diffusion. Beyond testing existing models, this project will incorporate network community boundaries and overlap into new descriptive and predictive models of information diffusion and opinion formation.     Understanding how information diffuses and how opinions are formed in today's highly connected and community-focused online environments has important implications not just for public policy and marketing, but also for the dissemination of innovations. Knowing how to traverse community boundaries, or conversely, to target different communities separately, can also facilitate the spread and adoption of educational and community outreach efforts, including those initiated by several educational institutions in Second Life. The research will directly feed into network and data analysis courses taught by the principal investigator as part of two new social computing and information retrieval Masters of Information Science specializations. It will add to a collection of online data sets, analysis tools, and tutorials already shared by the principal investigator for educational and research purposes. Some of the online tutorials will be adapted as interactive exhibits in Second Life. To educate an even younger audience, one or more Discovery Carts on the topic of social networks will be developed in collaboration with the Ann Arbor Hands-on Museum, which will become part of the museum's outreach.",Lada Adamic|

For decades data structures have been used to facilitate everything from mundane bookkeeping tasks to important high-level applications such as analyzing biological data, web search, and routing in networks.  The goals of this research program are (1) to design and understand the limits of data structures that represent various types of metric spaces, and (2) to analyze and understand self-adjusting (aka self-organizing) data structures.  A metric is an object that abstracts the intuitive notions of space and distance; examples include geodesic distance on a globe, evolutionary distance between species, and the distance between DNA sequences.  Perhaps the most important class of metrics today are those that correspond to distance (or latency or monetary cost) in networks, such as computer networks, road networks, or social networks.  All networks with some physical basis in reality are prone to congestion and spontaneous failure, whether due to benign causes or coordinated sabotage.  Examples include malfunctioning network routers, blockage on road networks, and collapsing bridges.  One aim of this research is to design versatile metric data structures that are capable of answering distance, shortest path, and reachability queries in the presence of fluctuations in congestion, topology, and other features.    Broadly speaking, a self-adjusting data structure is one that automatically reorganizes its internal state in response to the environment in order to optimize its performance.  The PIs research goals are to settle some decades-old conjectures regarding the optimality of self-adjusting data structures and to apply the self-adjusting design philosophy more widely.

A significant analytical component of the research program will focus on better understanding the coarsening phenomena observed in ill-posed diffusion equations that are encountered in such disparate fields as image processing (where they appear in models of image segmentation), granular flow (where they describe the formation of shear bands in granular materials), and population dynamics (where they model aggregation of certain types of bacteria). A second component of the research program will develop novel numerical algorithms for efficient computation of the motion of multiple phases under geometric motions arising as steepest descent for energies that contain bulk and surface tension terms. These interfacial motions are frequently encountered not only in fundamental image processing and vision procedures such as image segmentation, but also in materials science where they can describe grain boundary motion in polycrystalline materials. A number of numerical ideas will be utilized in this direction, including the level set method and some novel alternatives to it. The algorithms will be tested on large scale computations of high scientific interest, such as three dimensional simulations of grain growth in materials, using many grains. In addition, the investigator will continue his research program in extending successful image processing models to the context of surface processing in computer graphics.    The image processing and computer vision tasks that will be impacted by results from this research program include image denoising and segmentation, which are fundamental preliminary operations that are needed whenever useful information is to be extracted from images or video automatically. The goal of image denoising is to remove artifacts and noise from images so that subsequent operations can be performed more reliably. The goal of segmentation is to identify parts of an image occupied by distinct objects.   Examples of practical applications where these procedures play a primary role include medical imaging, face recognition, and target identification and tracking. Insights gained from the analytical component of this research program will elucidate the nature of some of the most popular but incompletely understood techniques developed for these vision tasks, and consequently allow more effective use of these techniques. The new computational methods that will be developed as a major part of the project will allow efficient and accurate solution of the numerical problems encountered in these computer vision applications, and thus reduce the computer time needed for knowledge extraction from images and video. The numerical issues from computer vision that will be targeted by this research program have a lot in common with numerical issues seen in some central problems in materials science. This connection will in particular make it possible to apply the new computational methods to large scale simulations of the motion of grain boundaries in materials; this computational capability is highly desirable and would be invaluable in predicting the performance and reliability of materials.",Selim Esedoglu|

Dr. Mary Putman (University of Michigan) will address key unknowns of galaxy formation and evolution by examining gas dynamics and ionization in the Galactic halo and gas enrichment in nearby dwarf galaxies.  The hot diffuse halo may still harbor a substantial amount of a galaxy's baryons and fuel galaxy disks. This halo medium can be probed with high-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the Galactic halo that show a ""head-tail"" structure, or a high column density head trailed by a diffuse tail.  Simulations of these clouds moving through the halo will be compared to the observations, and by combining these comparisons with HVC distance constraints, the elusive density distribution, size, and mass of the diffuse Galactic halo will be probed. The origin and role of the diffuse halo will subsequently be assessed.  The amount of ionizing radiation escaping from spiral galaxy disks will be investigated with H-alpha observations of Galactic halo clouds. The radiation in the Galactic halo will be investigated with H-alpha maps of HVCs at a range of distances. This will include the Magellanic Stream, a gaseous halo feature that is intriguingly bright in H-alpha emission.  Gaseous flows within the building blocks of galaxies will be probed with metallicity measurements of H-II regions found in the outer gaseous disks of dwarf galaxies (well beyond an existing stellar component). This will address how dwarfs evolve and where the metals produced by the stars in these galaxies have gone.    As a part of this work, Dr. Putman will extend this research on galaxy evolution to middle schools throughout the Detroit-area through presentations done by University of Michigan undergraduate and graduate students. The impact of this program is two-fold. First, middle-school students in diverse school districts will experience an engaging, interactive program designed to trigger or maintain their interest in the sciences at a key stage of their development. Second, college students, and the future science educators, will reap the benefits of service learning by being trained to do the presentations.",Mary Putman|

Such data are becoming increasingly common in various fields.  Specifically, the investigator studies three different but related problems: a) statistical learning on networks via random walks, which includes semi-supervised classification for two and multiple classes, clustering, and analysis of categorical data; b) learning network structures, which deals with the situation where one is interested in identifying the underlying network structure from the data; c) variable selection with structural constraints, which deals with variable selection when there is inherent structure among the variables or parameters.    Recent advances in computing and measurement technologies have led to an explosion in the amount of data that are being collected in all areas of application.  Much of these data have complex structure, in the form of text, images, video, audio, streaming data, and so on.  This proposal focuses on one important class of problems, viz, data with network or graph structure.  Such data are common in diverse engineering and scientific areas, such as biology, computer science, electrical engineering, economics, sociology and so on.  While there has been extensive research on networks (primarily outside the field of Statistics), much of it deals with characterizing and modeling network structures.  The goal of the current research program is to exploit the network structure as additional information and develop statistical methods that take into account the structure of relationships between the data.  The research program will make significant contributions in several areas, including Statistics, Biology, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, IOE, Physics, Psychology and Sociology.  The educational program also includes substantial initiatives that will involve undergraduate and graduate students and expose them to state-of-the-art research in the topics related to the proposal.

The PI aims to generate a theoretical and computational framework for the first principles prediction of phase stability, diffusion and phase transformation kinetics in alloys, oxides and semi-conducting compounds that are simultaneously susceptible to order-disorder reactions as well as structural transformations. This will open the way to a truly first-principles prediction of the thermodynamic properties of most technologically important multi-component solids. The elucidation of the coupling between configurational and anharmonic vibrational excitations will pave the way for the discovery of new phase-change materials for memory storage, electrochemically activated shape-memory materials and thermoelectrics optimized to have a low thermal conductivity. The development of a first-principles formalism for substitutional diffusion will allow a rigorous characterization of diffusion during phase transformations of multi-component solids and lead to a better understanding of degradation mechanisms in hetero-structures used in structural and micro-electronics applications. An additional outcome of this effort will be implementing the computer modeling capabilities in the form of user-friendly software for the first-principles prediction of thermodynamic and kinetic properties to serve the goals of both research and education.     The project will connect existing computational power available to students with algorithms and modeling capabilities developed in the research effort to provide students with unprecedented access to user-friendly atomistic simulation software. Course development is undertaken to fulfill the educational benefit of this capability to solve real materials problems at the macroscopic length-scale. PI will be developing a novel undergraduate course that combines essential concepts and tools from solid-state physics with statistical mechanics with an emphasis on real materials. This course will cover the basics of solid-state physics and reinforce concepts by having students calculate and explore electronic properties with user-friendly ab initio electronic structure codes. The educational component will expand to cover elementary concepts of statistical mechanics and its role in coupling the Schroedinger equation to thermodynamics.

CSST was born out of a series of workshops sponsored by NSF involving over forty faculty members in diverse fields, such as social informatics, social computing, computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), computational social science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and information science. Workshop participants, recognizing the growing importance of research on the interplay of humans and technology, or socio-technical systems, proposed the CSST as a mechanism for promoting and supporting important research on social aspects of technological change. An identified high priority, even in advance of the formal creation of CSST, was initiation of an annual series of summer research institutes targeted at people entering the field of socio-technical systems research.

Recent evolutionary theory has emphasized the impact of the transfer of non-genetic information between mother and child on adult phenotype, particularly the effects of prenatal nutrition on infant growth outcomes. The postnatal transfer of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) via breastfeeding, however, offers new opportunities to explore the long-term effects of passive immunity. Breastfeeding is an ideal system for studying the transfer of immunity because it is highly influenced by cultural traditions, it provides life-long benefits, and because sIgA is specific to the diseases the mother has encountered in her environment. This research will evaluate the dynamics that govern this information transfer using insights from life history theory, addressing two questions: I) How does the maternal trade-off between current and future reproduction affect the transfer of immunoglobulins (specifically, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA)) between mother and infant via breastfeeding? and II) How does this maternal trade-off in investment affect the trade-offs infants face between growth and immune function (maintenance)? Within this framework, this project will also assess the impact of culture-specific breastfeeding practices and the local disease ecology on sIgA levels in both mothers and infants. Two hundred and forty breastfeeding Ariaal mother-infant pairs will be asked to participate in an interview, anthropometric measurements, and biomarker collection. Saliva and breast milk will be dried on filter paper and analyzed for sIgA, a field-friendly method currently under development by the co-PI. Evolutionary hypotheses will be analyzed using multivariate linear regression, adjusting for the pair's cultural and disease ecology.    This project proposes that life history trade-offs can illuminate patterns of breastfeeding and immunity in both mothers and infants. Within this evolutionary framework, it also considers how the breastfeeding system adapts to the local cultural and disease ecology. Passive immunity through breastfeeding is ideal to study the role of maternal effects in human populations because transfer of pathogen-specific antibodies from the mother's gut and culture-specific weaning behaviors that modify breast milk intake can influence offspring phenotype. This anthropological research has implications for health interventions targeting breastfeeding and infant mortality by testing the importance of the shared mucosal immunity between mother and infant, illuminating cultural barriers to breastfeeding interventions, and promoting the application of field-friendly methods of health assessment.",A.

For example, it has been proposed that vertical climbing pre-adapted hominins for bipedality.  However, whether Pliocene hominins or Miocene hominoids practiced vertical climbing is still a subject of debate. Kinematic work on wild chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda has shown that vertical climbing requires extreme foot dorsiflexion, coupled with foot inversion and abduction. It is thus hypothesized that the morphology of the ankle, or talocrural joint, in vertical climbing Old World anthropoids is (1) adapted for positions of extreme dorsiflexion, inversion, and abduction, and (2) adapted to withstand the forces incurred on the joint while being loaded in these foot positions. This project will examine the external and internal morphology of the ankle in thirteen species of living primates, including humans, to test whether vertical climbers have a distinct talocrural joint morphology. External morphology of the talocrural joint will be assessed using linear and angular properties of the tibia and talus. Furthermore, the complex shape of the ankle will be modeled using data obtained from 3D laser scans. The role of ankle ligaments in restricting joint motion and stabilizing the ankle will be determined by quantifying the specific location and shape of the bony attachments. Finally, the internal morphology of the talus will be examined using CT scans of modern anthropoid tali. To address whether extinct hominoids and hominins included vertical climbing in their locomotor repertoire, results obtained from the study of modern ankles will be applied to fossil tibia and tali, including CT scan data obtained from seven hominin tali from fossil localities in South Africa.    This project examines the ankle joint across a wide range of modern primates to help reconstruct the locomotion of extinct apes and humans, and test whether early human ancestors were capable tree climbers. This project focuses specifically on the ankle joint to test whether the remarkable tree climbing ability of modern apes has a deep history, and whether vertical tree climbing may have been a precursor to human bipedality. Because the ankle joint is so often injured in modern humans, this study will also track the evolutionary history of ankle ligaments using fossil tibia and tali to determine the timing of and circumstances leading to our modern ankle anatomy.",Laura MacLatchy|

Psychological and linguistic research suggests that the language of administration may influence responses through its impact on various cognitive processes and through the cultural frame that a language brings to the conversational context.  However, the extent to which the language of survey administration affects survey responding is currently unknown.  The objectives of this project are to examine the extent to which language of administration influences bilingual bicultural respondents' answers to survey questions and to investigate which types of questions are most susceptible to language effects.  These objectives will be addressed through secondary analyses of observational data and an experiment.  Secondary analyses of the New Immigrant Survey will compare differences in responses among those interviewed in English and those interviewed in Spanish and identify the types of questions for which these differences are particularly pronounced.  The lack of random assignment to a language will be overcome by using propensity score methods.  In addition, an experimental web survey of about 300 adult Arab-American immigrants from the Detroit area, randomly assigned to an English or Arabic version of the questionnaire, will be launched.  The experiment will include questions with varying degrees of sensitivity and social desirability across the American and Arab cultures to assess if the language of administration affects conformity with cultural norms.  It also will include autobiographical questions to assess differences in recall as a function of the match between the language spoken at the time of the initial encoding and the language at the time of recall.      This project brings basic psychological and linguistic research to bear on surveys of bilingual bicultural respondents, for whom the language of survey administration may evoke different cultural frames.  It will illuminate how the language of survey administration affects respondents' answers and will highlight the methodological implications for surveys of immigrant populations.  The broader societal impact of this work derives from the relevance of collecting accurate data from immigrants.  If language affects socially desirable responding and the accuracy of autobiographical recall, the choice of language may be an important factor in collecting accurate data for policy decisions.  At present, little is known about these possibilities, despite the considerable resources invested in surveys of immigrant populations.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",Norbert Schwarz|Robert Groves|Emilia Peytcheva

Considerable theoretical and empirical work has been devoted to investigating the hormonal bases and consequences of social behavior. This project will add to this body of knowledge through an integrated field and laboratory study of the behavioral endocrinology of male chimpanzees living in an unusually large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Behavioral observations of subjects will be collected during 12 months of fieldwork, while hormones will be assayed from urine collected non-invasively from them. These data will be combined to address several questions regarding the hormonal bases and consequences of two significant aspects of chimpanzee life, aggression and stress. Does reproductive aggression affect male chimpanzee testosterone levels? Does competition over estrous females and inter-community aggression elevate male testosterone? What factors affect secretion of the stress hormone, cortisol? Is cortisol mobilized in response to stressful events, such as territorial boundary patrols and hunting episodes? Do individual differences in personality influence male susceptibility to stress? Do coping mechanisms and social support reduce cortisol levels? The extraordinary size of the Ngogo chimpanzee community will provide large samples of males and an ideal opportunity to test hypotheses designed to address these questions.     This research will advance scientific knowledge in two important ways. First, results will improve our understanding of our closest living relatives by clarifying the hormonal mechanisms regulating their behavior. Second, findings from this research promise to shed light on the evolution of our own behavior. Humans and chimpanzees possess identical hormones and share several unique behaviors, such as lethal territorial aggression and social support provided by unrelated individuals. By determining whether similar physiological mechanisms underlie these behaviors, this research will provide insights into their evolution. Finally, an important consequence of this research will be to aid the conservation of chimpanzees, a highly endangered species. Field research activities will safeguard an area that supports an extremely high density of chimpanzees and one of the last remnants of tropical forest in East Africa.",John Mitani|

Hydrogen can be stored in compressed tanks, in liquefied form, and in compressed tanks filled with sorbent materials. The most promising technique is the sorbent approach. The sorbent approach includes metal hydrides and adsorbents. For transportation applications, the U. S. Department of Energy has set 6.5 wt% and 62 kg H2/m3 as the targets for on-board hydrogen storage at ambient temperature. The pressure is not specified, but 100 atm has been a nominal pressure for research.  As a reference, for a compact passenger vehicle powered by fuel cell, 4 kg H2 is needed for a driving range of 400 km. Other examples for mobile applications are storage for portable electronics such as laptop computers and cell phones that are powered by fuel cells, as well as for non-automobile transportation applications such as motorcycles.    To develop new adsorbents for hydrogen storage at ambient temperature is a most challenging problem.  Using the hydrogen spillover approach, via a simple bridging building technique (for facilitating the spillover process), we have recently prepared sorbents that have achieved by far the highest reproducible (i.e., by the DOE-designated validation lab) storage amounts at the ambient temperature among all known sorbents. Recent experiments and theoretical studies from other laboratories have shown that the interactions between both H2 and H with carbon can be substantially increased by boron-substitution or nitrogen-substitution in the carbon, leading to increased storage capacities. This research is aimed at developing B- and N-substituted carbon materials for hydrogen storage for both mobile and stationary applications, as well as for obtaining a fundamental understanding of the hydrogen spillover phenomenon on B- and N-substituted carbons for hydrogen storage.  Our work will begin with synthesis of B- and N-substituted carbons with high surface areas.  Our approach will include both direct doping of metals (for hydrogen dissociation into hydrogen atoms) on the B- and N-substituted carbon, and by using our bridging technique to further increase the spillover storage.  A fundamental understanding of the spillover phenomenon will be obtained by using a number of techniques, including the use of deuterium (D) isotope tracer for following the kinetics and mechanism of spillover. The new sorbents developed in this work should be applicable for both mobile and stationary power sources.    	 This project will involve active participation of a diversity of graduate as well as undergraduate students. The students will be active in disseminating the findings and discoveries at national meetings and through publications.	The research will lead to a new technology for hydrogen storage, which is crucially needed for realizing a future ""hydrogen economy.""  The new sorbents developed in this work will be applicable for both mobile and stationary power sources.  Also, the sorbents developed in this work can be readily transferred to industrial applications.  In addition, a basic understanding of the hydrogen spillover and reverse spillover phenomena will be obtained in this work.",Ralph Yang|

O'Connor,"April 30,  2009",63297,,ben.b.hansen@umich.edu,3003 South State St.,Ann Arbor,MI,48109,7347641817L,SBE,1333,OTHR|0000,,753164,"The project comprises methodological research to aid the analysis of comparative studies; that is, studies comparing ""treated"" subjects to controls in order to estimate effects of the treatment.  Its starting point is an influential approach associated with Donald Rubin and Paul Rosenbaum, among others.  In this approach, if such a study can be assumed latently randomized -- conditional on the covariate, treatment is assigned as if at random -- then the sample is reorganized into suitably similar blocks, and later analysis proceeds as if assignment to treatment had been manifestly at random, at least within these blocks.  Techniques with which to reorganize samples in this way, such as matching and propensity scoring, have received much methodological attention in recent years, but whether and when it is inferentially valid to treat the transformed sample as if it had manifestly been randomized remains incompletely understood.  In propensity-score matching, for example, extant methodological literature is relatively silent on estimation uncertainty in the propensity score, on imprecision in matching on it, and on how to determine whether these errors may be large enough to invalidate the adjustment.  The primary aim of the present project is to use new characterizations of these errors, which are compatible with widely used forms of propensity stratification, to develop diagnostics for the suitability of a given propensity matching or stratification.  Secondarily, the project assumes that manifestly randomized studies, along with those being treated as such, are to be analyzed with methods that rely only on properties of randomization, rather than model-based methods.  These methods differ from those most commonly used in the social sciences to analyze comparative studies, but they can build on and borrow strength from better-known methods as this project will also make clear.  The project's methodological advances will be demonstrated in social science applications, and will be made freely available in high-quality open source software.     A motivating premise of the project is that good statistical methods not only better meet the needs of specialists who use them but also enable nonspecialists to more readily and accurately appraise the quantitative evidence those specialists produce.  The research therefore concerns itself with a type of statistical adjustment, matching, that is distinguished for its simplicity and appeal to non-technical audiences.  Because it and related methods are already quite popular, the methods and methodological extensions developed by the project will be immediately and directly applicable to any number of empirical investigations in the social and behavioral sciences, many of which have public health or public policy implications.  These methods' emphasis on diagnostics, and on statistical conclusions based on the same independence assumptions that the diagnostics seek to corroborate, may help to demystify the statistical component of empirical investigations to which they contribute, and to make transparent the evidential strengths and weaknesses of particular studies.  The project also seeks to make the methods themselves more broadly available.  By generating freely available software, it will enable all who are so inclined to use the techniques in their own analyses.  By including undergraduate and graduate students in the research, it contributes to the training of future quantitative social science methodologists.  Because it includes a plan for special marketing of this opportunity to underrepresented minority college students, it complements efforts by others to cultivate research expertise among underrepresented groups.",Bendek Hansen|

Bhattacharya, University of Michigan Ann Arbor    Objective: The objective of this research is to realize high-temperature (>200K) spintronic devices with InP-based hetrostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The reasons of choosing InP-based hetrostructures are the following : (i) these are used for high frequency transistors and for fiber-optic communication at 1.3 and 1.55 ?m; even for future CMOS-based VLSI, InAs and InSb on silicon are being investigated for the superior carrier transport properties therein; (ii) very little is experimentally known regarding spin injection in InP-based alloys. The approach is to investigate and realize three specific devices: (a) spin valves for the study of spin injection, transport and detection; (b) semiconductor-ferromagnet based memory devices; and (c) spin lasers and their modulation with spin torque devices.      Intellectual Merit: Spin-based ferromagnet/semiconductor heterojunction devices are particularly attractive, compared to all-metal spintronic devices, due to the versatility and the long spin coherence time in semiconductors. However, till date, practical semiconductor spintronic devices that can operate at or near room temperature do not exist. The proposed program of research will address this critical need.      Broader Impact: The proposed program is interdisciplinary in nature and will provide a broad impact to science and society beyond technical merits. The economic impact of the research and its outcome will be felt as the proposed devices complement or selectively replace traditional microelectronics. This work combines spintronics with other fields in science and engineering for real applications. Outreach projects for women and underrepresented minorities are proposed to provide research experience for undergraduates and expose high school students to scientific and engineering disciplines.",Pallab Bhattacharya|

The new method exploits the internal strain energy accumulated in an elastic bar to impart a high speed, high energy pulse onto a specimen. The proposed test system overcomes the combined limitations of traditional impact test setups and enables high quality impact testing in a scalable, cheap, compact, fast and safe manner. Another critical advantage is the ability to test with a small set-up, relatively large size specimens, which permits tests that more truly represent the behavior of non-homogenous building materials. Fundamental research will be conducted to optimize and explore the capabilities of the proposed system. The developed system will then be used to investigate the rate dependent behavior of high performance and ultra high performance fiber reinforced cementitious composites. These materials are known to possess exceptional strength, ductility and toughness under pseudo-static loading and therefore have the potential to serve as highly damage tolerant and energy absorbing materials under rapid loading conditions.     The improvements in impact testing promised by the proposed technology will lead to faster de-velopment of better and more economical impact-resisting building materials. Enhancement in material response under high strain rate will eventually result in improvements in the ability of the national physical infrastructure system to better withstand unforeseen and extreme loading events. The work will also have an important impact on the development of human resources. Through the involvement of a diverse set of student researchers, a new generation of students will be introduced to the use of computational structural simulation, high strain rate testing, and high-performance structural materials.",Sherif El-Tawil|Antoine Naaman

The high-spectral-resolution radiance measurements of AIRS contain the fingerprints of radiative forcing by a variety of atmospheric thermodynamic variables and constituent concentrations, and these fingerprints lead directly to longwave greenhouse forcing and atmospheric feedbacks. Because clouds and surface temperature contribute similar spectral signatures, radio occultation will provide the information to distinguish between the two.     The investigators found, under their previous NSF support, that radio occultation trends constrain the surface air temperature response of climate models while infrared spectral radiance trends unambiguously constrain radiative forcing of the climate and the longwave feedbacks in climate models. Now they will apply these findings to the aforementioned satellite data to obtain estimates of radiative forcing by well-mixed greenhouse gases globally to at least 10% uncertainty, to estimate tropical water vapor and cloud longwave feedbacks to ~7% uncertainty by anomaly analysis, and to begin the estimation of global longwave feedbacks by trend analysis, albeit with large uncertainties due to natural variability.

The technological, economic, and energetic feasibility of supercritical water gasification (SCWG) has been demonstrated. Biomass, either ""energy crops"" or agricultural and food processing waste, can be gasified to produce H2 or syngas. SCWG of biomass is one approach for sustainable energy production.     Though the feasibility of SCWG has been demonstrated, very little is known about the kinetics and pathways of the chemical reactions that govern SCWG. Such information is of interest scientifically because it will extend our knowledge of hydrothermal organic chemistry into a new region that has received scant attention. The information is also of interest technologically because it can be used to facilitate the design, optimization, and analysis of SCWG processes.     The goal of this project is to determine the kinetics and pathways for both homogeneous and catalyzed SCWG of a set of model compounds under well characterized conditions. This work will focus on reporting the kinetics for SCWG in metal-free reactors and the results from detailed analysis of products in both the liquid and gas phases. The PI will use thick-walled glass capillary tubes as mini batch reactors.     There are two primary components of this research.

The other is to determine the reaction kinetics and pathways for catalyzed gasification of these model compounds.     BROADER IMPACTS    The project will generate scientific advances and, eventually, technological advances. The PI will publish the scientific advances to broadly disseminate them. If technological advances are achieved, the benefit of this work will extend to the energy industry and the general public (by having a more politically stable and sustainable source for electricity and transportation fuels). The project will also provide training for a graduate student and about six undergraduate students, so there are human resource benefits. Additionally, the PI will continue his practice of incorporating his research results into the undergraduate and graduate classes he teaches at Michigan, so there will be benefits related to the integration of teaching and research. Thus, the broader impacts of this project include the possibility of technological advances that move us toward a more renewable and sustainable energy supply, the development of human resources in science and engineering, the broad dissemination of project results, and the integration of research and teaching.",Phillip Savage|

Important components of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are electrodes (anode and cathode) which activate electrochemical catalytic reactions. Even though, SOFCs are very promising devices, it is astonishing how little is known about the underlying mechanisms of electrochemical reactions that govern the performance of the SOFC electrodes. For example, even for a conceptually very simple H2-oxidation reaction (H2 + O2- = H2O + 2e-) at the SOFC anode, there exist a large number of mutually conflicting elementary step mechanisms that have been proposed based on various experiments. Recent review papers in the field as well as the reports of various scientific advisory committees have emphasized the need for a better molecular level understanding of electrochemical reactions at interfaces of solid electrodes and solid electrolytes.     This project will employ quantum Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to study elementary step mechanisms of electro-catalytic oxidation reactions over solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes. We will employ realistic model systems that account for the presence of the metal/electrolyte interface. Potential bias and electric field effects will be incorporated in our first principles calculations. While we focus on SOFC anodes, the proposed methodology is universal and it can be easily employed to address other electro-catalytic systems where solid-state electrochemistry plays a role, such as solid-state sensors, microelectronic devices, solid-state batteries, and many others. We note that the methodology outlined in this proposal has not been utilized previously to study solid-state electrochemistry.    The central objective is to aid the development of predictive molecular theories aimed towards the discovery of novel SOFC material. To accomplish these objectives, we have identified four major goals: (1) we will develop a very general methodology that will allow us to study heterogeneous electro-catalytic reaction from first principles, (2) we will asses the thermodynamic feasibility of multiple elementary step mechanisms that have been proposed based on the previous experimental studies of SOFC anodes, (3) we will investigate the kinetics of the various proposed mechanisms by integrating the elementary step information into micro-kinetic models, (4) we will integrate the approach in our educational activities via multiple outreach activities and a new course development.    The focus is on the theoretical studies since the solid-state electrochemical reactions are difficult to probe experimentally. The difficulties stem from: (i) an inherent experimental inaccessibility of the catalytically important metal/electrolyte interface sites, (ii) high electric fields, (iii) high potential bias, and (iii) high temperatures at which these reactions take place. The proposed theoretical framework will address these issues. We have already performed significant preliminary work demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed approach.    Our central educational objective is to promote molecular approach to energy related science and technology. The educational objectives will be addressed via multiple outreach activities and the integration of the material into the curriculum. For example our group will participate in the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP) which offers free engineering classes to students in grades 7 and 8 from the Detroit area and the NASA Summer High  School Appreciation Program (SHARP) which aims to introduce high school students (grade 10 and 11) to active scientific research.    The concepts proposed in this research project will also be integrated into the curriculum by introducing a cluster of courses related to energy and sustainability. This will be taught by a number of faculty members, including the PI, in the department. Furthermore, graduate students who are directly involved in the research program will be exposed to a comprehensive set of theoretical and experimental tools that will allow them to tackle most of the relevant electro-catalysis issues. In addition, we will design an educational module that will be annually presented to large groups of high school students that visit the U of Michigan during summer months. In our laboratory, we also have a three months long research internship that we offer to a promising high school student.",Suljo Linic|

This gave the original motivation for Thomas Lam and the PI to introduce and study the skew version of total positivity. Further investigation in this direction, and in particular the relation of skew total positivity to the theory of total positivity developed by George Lusztig, is the subject of the first project. The second project grew out of an attempt to reinterpret the often used standard bases of the coordinate ring of Grassmanians, and to find different kinds of bases occurring naturally. The question is closely related to the question of triangulating the cone of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, which motivated David Speyer and the PI to introduce the notion of driving rules as a way to locally determine the triangulation. Properties of the simplicial complexes and the bases which arise are the subject of the investigation. The third project deals with K-homology of Grassmanian, studied so far to a smaller extend than the dual notion of K-theory. The first step in this direction was taken by Thomas Lam and the PI who introduced dual stable Grothendieck polynomials as representatives of Schubert classes in the K-homology ring. Further questions to be studied include the K-theoretic version of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, K-homology of complete flag varieties and more.    The unifying theme of all three projects is the study of nice varieties, such as Grassmanians and more general flag varieties. A Grassmanian as the variety of all k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional space. An old and yet active research area is Schubert calculus, which - very roughly - studies how subspaces of a space intersect. A simple example would be the following question: in a three-dimensional space four lines in generic position are chosen. What is the number of lines that intersect all four of them? Schubert calculus was recently enriched by the work of George Lusztig, who defined and studied a special part of flag varieties, called totally the positive part. Real numbers naturally come with a notion of positive and negative, and when we consider flag varieties over real numbers there is a way to identify a positive part in them. The study of the totally positive part has lead to a number of beautiful recent developments.",Pavlo Pylyavskyy|

New methods that go beyond the range of nonlinear potential theory in the context of global rigidity questions will be introduced, and new geometric structures on quasiconformal manifolds will be explored.    Quasiconformal methods give information about the geometrical properties of spaces simultaneously at all scales.

Engineering Change refers to a change to the shape, dimensions, structure, material, manufacturing process, etc. of a part or assembly after the initial design has been released. Evaluating ECs is a time-consuming process due to the complexity of typical products and the lifecycle-wide impact of a change. The research focus is on the development of (i) meaningful representations of ECs and (ii) techniques for searching previous similar ECs. Complexities stem from the disparity of resources that can cause or are affected by the engineering change. This research assumes the existence of a Cyberinfrastructure (CI) and focuses on the design of CI-aware models and solution approaches. Techniques from ontology-based computing, information theory and machine learning are used.     If successful, this research will provide a scientific foundation to the current ad-hoc change evaluation process. It will advance our understanding of how the disparate components of engineering change data relate to each other. The research results will benefit designers in the context of globalization, which is increasing the pressure to manage component and process changes while maintaining or improving quality and reducing costs with shorter turn-around times. Fast, accurate and reliable evaluation of the impact of engineering changes will result in cost benefits to industry and the US government that extend beyond benefits realized by just overcoming errors or incremental improvements in the design or manufacturing processes. Results will be disseminated through the University of Michigan?s PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) Alliance and included in a graduate course in Global Product Development that brings together students from the U.S., Germany, and South Korea to work in global design teams.

Therefore, analysis and minimization of such losses are of industrial importance. Clearly, the study of transients is of theoretical importance as well.  The goals of this project are the development of a theory for analysis and design of production systems from the point of view of the transients and the application of this theory for productivity improvement in the automotive industry.

This viewpoint is based on the principle of multistability, whereby the state of a system is attracted to input-dependent equilibria.  For material damping, a postulated multistability mechanism for hysteretic damping is snap-through buckling, where the attractivity of multiple equilibrium shapes can transform viscous damping into hysteretic (asymptotically low frequency) energy dissipation. Likewise, in surface contact, the sudden-release mechanism provides a multistability foundation for hysteretic friction.  The principle of multistability thus provides a novel paradigm for understanding how hysteresis arises from the constitutive relations of elastic and inelastic structural mechanics, while serving as a unifying principle for modeling and control of energy-dissipative hysteresis.  This project will develop rheological models for hysteretic damping and friction based on the principle of multistability.   We will develop and analyze multistable models for hysteretic damping and friction, experimentally verify these models through laboratory experiments, and develop and implement nonlinear control methods for mechanical systems with hysteresis.    Understanding the dynamics of mechanical systems can impact the physical infrastructure and economic health of our Country.  Examples  include buildings and bridges subject to earthquakes as well as precision devices in robotic systems used for manufacturing.   At even smaller levels, nanometer-size mechanical devices provide the basis for innovative sensors for security applications.  The dynamics of these systems depend on the way in which these systems dissipate energy.  Energy is dissipated in two principal ways, namely, by damping and friction.  Although the effects of damping and friction can be measured experimentally, these phenomena are notoriously difficult to analyze and predict.  This project adopts a novel approach to understanding damping and friction by constructing models that capture hysteretic damping, which refers to damping that is able to dissipate energy under slow motion.  This project is based on the concept of multistability, which means that the system can come to rest at multiple equilibria.  The number and structure of these multiple equilibria provide insights into the physical mechanisms that give rise to hysteretic damping.  By understanding these physical mechanisms, this project will provide engineers with the ability to model and predict the dynamics of mechanical systems in a wide range of applications.",Dennis Bernstein|

One studies these singularities in two settings: in characteristic zero and in positive characteristic. In each setting one defines invariants that measure the singularities. Despite the different definitions, the two sets of invariants exhibit many common features and subtle connections. In characteristic zero, the invariants to be studied (more precisely, the log canonical threshold, and the minimal log discrepancies) are defined in terms of divisorial valuations. A fundamental result, the existence of resolution of singularities, gives a strong finiteness statement when computing these invariants. The motivation for the interest in such invariants comes from their applications to birational geometry: certain conjectural properties of these invariants imply the termination of flips, one of the outstanding open problems in higher dimensions. The PI plans to study questions related to the main conjecture on log canonical thresholds, that asserts that in fixed dimension,  there are no increasing sequences of such invariants. Another part of the proposal concerns invariants defined in positive characteristic via the Frobenius morphism. They come out of tight closure theory, but have many subtle connections with the  invariants in characteristic zero. In particular, a basic conjecture in the field connects in a precise way the invariants in characteristic zero to those in positive characteristic, via reduction mod p. The PI proposes to use D-module theoretic ideas in order to study this conjecture.    Singularities are responsible for many phenomena, both in geometry and in arithmetic. For example, they govern the asymptotic of the number of solutions of congruences modulo prime powers, or the integrability of powers of polynomials. It has been realized in the past few years that invariants of singularities that show up in different contexts have deep connections amongst them. One can hope that by approaching singularities from these various points of view, one can get a richer picture, that can be used to attack problems with applications in other fields.",Mircea Mustata|

Preliminary studies have shown that the demand for discretionary purchase items, such as automobiles, apparel, consumer electronics, and home furnishings is correlated with the movement of economic indicators. These findings present an opportunity to use information about market expectations embedded in the prices of financial instruments to improve demand forecasting, production planning, and inventory thus reducing risk. This project aims to establish that the market indicators can be used to plan inventories in supply chains that are optimal not just in a static sense but also dynamically, and to test whether and how the value of the firm is correlated with the economic indicators driving the forecasts. The proposed work also includes the examination of the effect of price information on inventories when the price of the product can be forecasted using prices of traded market instruments.     The project consists of four parts: forecasting, optimal decision-making, hedging, and empirical validation. If successful, this research will lead to better understanding of the connections between economic factors with supply chain demand and inventory planning. The results will provide a mechanism to inventory planners to use readily available and reliable market information for inventory planning, profit forecasting, and hedging purposes. They also provide a systematic method for developing and testing profit and risk equations using models of supply chains, and allow the enterprises to better understand how the cost of procurement and the volatility of prices and demand affect risk in a simple and joint manner, and thus, the firms will be able to make use of market factors in designing inventory and production systems.",Xiuli Chao|

The PIs will invoke concepts from contracts and incentives theory, such as Bayesian equilibria, the revelation principle, collusion, and decision-delegation, to derive the manufacturer's optimal information-eliciting contracts.

Under this method, video streams are initially collected from a calibrated set of high resolution video cameras that is progressively traversed around a construction site. The possible correspondences of each point in each video camera?s view are computed (epipolar lines) and the corresponding points are matched using a novel window similarity matching method that compares the video frame along each epipolar line. Based on each match and the camera calibration, the depth value of each point is computed, and the depth map (dense point cloud) of the scene is generated. In each subsequent frame, all points with a previously identified correspondence in the other video camera?s frame are tracked using established 2D point tracking techniques. This prevents redundant and computationally intensive epipolar line computation and correspondence matching. The resulting point cloud at each frame is then converted to a 3D surface using intelligent proximity algorithms, and the visual data are overlaid to produce a photorealistic, rendered 3D surface.    The proposed method is significantly automated, allowing the user to reconstruct a scene or structure progressively and in real time, without the need for post-processing. It can also identify and track complex point clouds with a variable precision (according to the user needs). The data resolution is virtually limitless, since both macro and micro data sensing is possible by adjusting the distance of the sensor system to its targets and using the proper lenses. The equipment cost is two orders of magnitude less than the cost of a LiDAR scanner, and also compact, lightweight and highly portable. Thus, the immediate advantage that will result from this work is the ability to automate the 3D surface generation step of the ?as-built? model generation process and significantly reduce the cost for the necessary remote sensing equipment. Currently, engineers need to spend several days to post process the raw data and convert them to a basic 3D surface. Under this approach, engineers need only scan the desired site until the automatically generated 3D surface is consistent with their needs. This improvement is expected to open up new avenues for future research and enhancements that can ultimately achieve real-time model generation. It is therefore expected to significantly reduce the time and effort needed to create an ?as-built? model. This will increase the infiltration of innovative spatial modeling technologies to the AEC industry and allow its benefits to be realized by the majority of construction projects, especially by small projects, where",Ioannis Brilakis|

This research is concerned with the properties and interactions of biomolecular motors, ubiquitous nanoscale protein machines that are principally responsible for nano- to microscale transport processes insides eukaryotic cells. The hallmark of these systems is their complex dynamics and organization which are widely believed to be crucial for understanding, manipulating, and finally controlling these systems for (bio-) technological use. The main goal of the work is to characterize and exploit the nonlinear dynamic mechanisms which govern the cooperative behavior of multiple molecular motors carrying a common  cargo.    The proposed work will answer several crucial scientific questions, and will impact a large number of applications. Understanding how motor proteins function and cooperate to transport cargoes is a key engineering element in applications such as drug delivery and design, and has a strong potential to impact medicine (e.g.  clinical paradigms and treatments of an array of diseases such as Parkinson's and cancer). Such understanding can be obtained by an approach such as proposed herein, where quantitative, nonlinear dynamics approaches are used to solve this important problem in cell biology.

A predictive mathematical model will be created using our characterization data, particularly real-time kinetics measurements and spatial mapping of CNT forests by X-ray scattering. This will enable production of CNT forests having specified tolerances on diameter, length, and structural quality, for both batch-style and continuous processing.

The next few years will be a period of unique opportunity with these two gamma-ray missions operating in space. Data from GLAST is likely to illuminate a significant puzzle of GRBs: the emission of photons of very high energies. The wide field of view of the ROTSE instruments will enable localization of a large fraction of the detected events, a task exceedingly difficult for more conventional ground-based instruments. The response time of the ROTSE telescopes is short enough to begin observations while many bursts are still emitting gamma-rays or X-rays.     Over the past few years, ROTSE has collected data that, in conjunction with contemporaneous X-ray data, indicate that previous assumptions about the dynamics of GRB afterglows are inadequate to explain the combined measurements. ROTSE data analyses have identified 30 SNe, most spectacularly SN2005ap, SN2006gy and SN2007if. These remarkable events exhibit a peak brightness 10 times greater than type-IA SNe, thus pointing to a new class of explosions. Although the aperture of the telescopes is modest, their wide field of view enables the discovery of SNe shortly after the initial explosion and thus enables more a complete exploration of the dynamics.     ROTSE has been a rich source of data for the study of astrophysical transient phenomena.

Now, this literature must address more focused questions about how the institutions of cooperation work and how they change state behavior. Moreover, after over fifty years of intense realist-antirealist debate in international relations (much of which turns on the question of the value and function of international agreements), no one has systematically collected data on important dimensions of international agreements. Hence, it is also time to collect such data to use them to confront both old and new theories.   The first aspect of my research program develops a theoretical framework that explains international agreement design in terms of a set of logically derived and empirically testable hypotheses. The framework is based on a rational choice perspective in which actors purposefully design agreement and institutions to advance their joint interests. The theoretical aspect continues the line of work already established by Koremenos and others.   The second aspect consists of collecting data on the characteristics of a large sample of international agreements drawn from the United Nations Treaty Series. The principal investigator focuses on four types of provisions: flexibility provisions, such as planned renegotiations and escape clauses, monitoring and compliance provisions, agreement scope (the number of issues covered), and references to other international agreements. These dimensions are motivated by important (and interesting) theoretical questions in the existing literature.   The datasheet allows reseachers who study international cooperation to test their theories in much the same way as the Correlates of War and Militarized International Disputes datasets enable researchers who study international conflict to test their ideas. The data are available to the research community once assembled. As such, the project represents an important contribution to the research infrastructure of international relations. The feasibility of the proposed project is demonstrated by a successful test sample already drawn by the principal investigator. This sample reveals systematic variation in agreement provisions across issue areas.   The third aspect consists of statistical analyses of the collected data. Given that this is the first data collection effort of its kind, this basic descriptive work represents an important contribution to the literature. Furthermore, and in contrast to the existing literature, which mainly illustrates theories of how states cooperate with case studies., these data allow researchers to test theories.   The proposal also contains a substantial undergraduate and graduate teaching component. Several graduate students will use the datset in their dissertations. Undergraduate and graduate courses are to be developed based on the research design, with a particular focus on how to collect data that can be used to test empirically predictions from formal theory.

Martin, The University of Michigan, Department of Materials Science and Engineering.    TECHNICAL SUMMARY    	Polymer and organic molecular semiconductors are of considerable interest for creating inexpensive electronic devices.  Previous studies of polycrystalline organic molecular films have shown evidence that grain boundary defects play an important role in limiting the performance of these materials.  However the detailed relationship between the microstructure and macroscopic properties of these materials remains obscure and controversial.  Liquid crystalline polymer and organic molecular semiconductors are of particular current interest, because it is expected that the more modest distortions near grain boundaries and other defects in the solid-state may not lead to the large reductions in properties seen in polycrystalline films. The microstructure of liquid crystalline polymer and organic molecular semiconductors will be investigated using an array of instruments and techniques including optical microscopy, wide angle X-ray diffraction, small angle X-ray diffraction, scanned probe microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, low voltage electron microscopy, and high resolution electron microscopy.  These microstructural details will be correlated with information about sample performance on thin-film transistor devices, and with impedance spectroscopy of the carrier transport.  The fundamental scientific challenge is to determine if and how the increased order provided by liquid crystalline order makes it possible to create films that have better performance than either the amorphous or polycrystalline structures seen in other organic molecular solids.      NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    	There is considerable interest and future potential in developing new materials for all-organic ""plastic"" electronics.  Examples of such devices include soft, flexible computers and displays printed on flexible substrates, and biomedical components that can be directly implanted into the body.  However there are many important questions about these materials that are not yet known, such as the detailed relationship between their local structure and the properties that they exhibit when used in devices.  This research project will make it possible to develop improved materials that can be easily and inexpensively processed and manufactured into components.  This project will provide for financial support for graduate students from Materials Science, Macromolecular Science, and Biomedical Engineering.

An important area of  this interaction involves the theory of Gromov-Witten  invariants. In physics, it counts the instantons corrections of  Calabi-Yau space. In mathematics, it provides important  invariants for algebraic and symplectic geometry. Inspired by  both mathematics and physics, Gromov-Witten theory has been  established in a variety of situations such as relative  Gromov-Witten theory and orbifold Gromov-Witten theory. Each of  them is an integral part of the big picture and they have been  essential for a complete understanding of Gromov-Witten  theory. This proposal seeks to advance Gromov-Witten theory in  two directions; (i) expanding Gromov-Witten theory to the  Landau-Ginzburg/singularities model and developing it as an  effective computational tool for ordinary Gromov-Witten theory;  (ii) applying Gromov-Witten theory to study symplectic birational  geometry.    Mathematics is always an important tool and language in our  understanding of the structure of the universe we live in.  In  the string theoretic model of the universe, modern mathematical  subjects such as geometry and topology play an ever bigger  role. In particular, Gromov-Witten invariants enter these models  as important physical quantities called instanton  corrections. This project will improve our ability to calculate  instanton corrections and hence enhance our understanding of the  possible structure of the universe.",Yongbin Ruan|

It is hypothesized that the master equation (ME) approach for this class of reactions suffers from a failure of Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory because of slow intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR).  Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations will be used to assess the importance of slow IVR in the reaction system consisting of peroxy radicals (RO2) with nitric oxide (NO) to form alkoxy radicals (RO) or alkyl nitrates (RONO2).  When feasible, analytical potential energy surfaces will be constructed; direct dynamics with a parameterized semiempirical quantum theory like NDDO-SRP (neglect of diatomic differential overlap - specific reaction parameters) will also be used to calculate the potential and its gradients.  Both approaches will be evaluated using high level electronic structure calculations.  Temperature and pressure-dependent yields of nitrates from nitrate radical (NO3) + alkene reactions of primary and secondary alkenes as a function of carbon chain length will also be calculated.

Three specific projects form the core of the work to be undertaken.  The first will develop computer algorithms for the detection and analysis of dense subgraphs within networks, also called modules or communities, which, in addition to providing a window on large-scale network structure, can serve as a foundation for coarse-graining techniques, visualization, graph layout, and automated network summarization and feature extraction in large network data sets. The second project will look at the resilience of networks to the failure of network nodes, a topic that has direct applications in communications networks such as the Internet as well as in the theory of the spread of disease through social networks.  The project will look in particular at the resilience created by the existence of multiple independent paths in networks and the related graph theoretical concept of k-components.  The third project will focus on the development of exploratory analysis methods for discovering structure in large network data sets in an unsupervised fashion, making use of machine learning and statistical techniques.  These techniques are aimed at the extraction of new knowledge from experimental network data sets such as large-scale social networks or biological networks.    Networks occur widely in the sciences and technology.  The Internet, the World Wide Web, online social networks, and the biological networks that power living cells are just a few of the examples that have grabbed headlines in the last few years.  The research funded under this grant focuses on the development of both fundamental new mathematics and practical computer methods for understanding and analyzing the wealth of network data that is becoming available to scientists.  A significant problem with our current understanding of networks is created by the sheer size of many of the networks we are faced with.  The web, for example, has nodes numbering in the billions, and a complete visualization of the entire network is impossible with current resources (and probably wouldn't be very useful even if it were possible).  The techniques to be developed here focus on answering the question of what a network ""looks like,"" even when we can't look at it directly.  One project will focus on ""modules"" in networks -- groups of tightly connected nodes, which may correspond to cliques or communities in a social network or functional modules in a biological network -- and will develop computer methods for automatically discovering these modules, allowing the experimenter to uncover the large-scale structure of a network.  Another project will look at resilience of networks to the failure of their nodes, an issue that is of prime importance for the maintenance of functioning communication networks and is also related to the development of efficient vaccination strategies to prevent the spread of disease over social networks.  A third project will develop automated methods for revealing hitherto unseen regularities in the connection patterns between nodes, allowing scientists to extract useful information from network data even in emerging areas where our current understanding is very incomplete.",Mark Newman|

The algorithm is based on a sequence of filtering operations which converges to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate, and is therefore termed iterated filtering.  The availability of iterated filtering methodology opens up many possibilities for developing new classes of stochastic dynamic models for use as data analysis tools.  One component of the proposed research program is development of a new class of Markov chain models appropriate for biological systems, consisting of interacting Poisson processes whose rates are subject to white noise. Another goal is to broaden the class of dynamical systems for which likelihood based inference is practical, via increased theoretical understanding of iterated filtering.  Specifically, a new theoretical framework for iterated filtering will be developed, based on identifying a relationship with previously studied stochastic approximation techniques. Techniques of averaging over iterations and searching over a sequence of random directions, which have good theoretical and practical properties for other stochastic approximation methods, are expected to be applicable to iterated filtering.  The third component of the proposed research is to demonstrate the role of the new methodology in facilitating a novel and scientifically relevant data analysis of malaria transmission.   Infectious diseases pose challenging and important questions which have long been a testing ground for inference methodology for dynamical systems.  Carrying out data analysis via new classes of continuous time dynamic models will require handling novel situations for diagnosing goodness of fit, and appropriate techniques will be developed and demonstrated.    Nonlinear stochastic dynamical models are widely used to study systems occurring throughout the sciences and engineering.  Such models are natural to formulate and can be analyzed mathematically and numerically. Despite decades of work, carrying out statistical inference for nonlinear dynamical models remains a challenging and important problem.  Recently, progress has been made possible by new methodology taking advantage of increasing computational resources.  Continued progress requires building theoretical understanding of successfully demonstrated methodology, developing new methodologies, and showing how these advances can be used to further scientific knowledge about dynamical systems of interest. Recent motivations for understanding infectious disease dynamics include the threats posed by emerging diseases (HIV/AIDS, SARS, pandemic influenza), re-emerging diseases (malaria, tuberculosis) and bioterrorism. Inference for dynamical systems arises in many diverse fields, including economics, neuroscience, chemical engineering, signal processing, and molecular biochemistry.  The field of Statistics forms a natural bridge to make methodological advances available to a wider research community.",Edward Ionides|

The covariance matrix plays a key role in many data analysis methods, including principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, inference about the means in multivariate analysis, and inference about independence  and conditional independence relationships in graphical models. Advances in random matrix theory have shown that the traditional estimator, the sample covariance, performs poorly in high dimensions.  The existing research on alternative estimators, including previous work of the PI, focuses mostly on the situation when there is a notion of distance or ordering for the variable indexes (time series, longitudinal data, spatial data, spectroscopy, etc).  However, there are many applications where such ordering is not available: for example, genetics, financial, social and economic data.   This project develops several methods for constructing regularized sparse estimators that are invariant to variable permutations, both for the covariance matrix and its inverse.  The main building blocks of the methods are thresholding, smooth penalties that encourage sparsity, permutation-invariant loss functions, adaptive weights, and manifold projections to discover potential structured re-orderings of the variables.  Analytical results establishing consistency and convergence rates of the proposed estimators in high dimensions are fully developed. These theoretical results in high dimensions require tools that are different from standard asymptotic analysis, and there are few available in the existing literature. Efficient optimization algorithms needed to compute these estimators are developed, with the emphasis on the computational cost growing as slowly as possible with dimension.  Some of the estimators proposed carry a very low computation cost by design, while others require computational ingenuity to be feasible in really high dimensions.  The proposed methodology is tested extensively, both in simulations and on a number of applications through the PI's interdisciplinary collaborations.      Massive amounts of data collected in the modern world are creating new challenges for statisticians.  There is an urgent need for new theoretical and practical methods that deal with high-dimensional data, and a vast number of applications where high-dimensional covariance matrices  need to be estimated as part of data analysis: finance, genetics, spectroscopy, remote sensing, climate studies, brain imaging, speech recognition, and many others.   The PI has ongoing  collaborations with chemists on Raman spectroscopy of bone, with oceanologists on using spectral data for remote ocean sensing, with climate scientists on temperature modeling and with a biostatistician on a new type of gene expression technology that works at protein level.  The PI also works actively in the area of statistical signal processing by wireless sensor networks, where spatial covariance estimation is important, and which has many security applications. The new methodology for estimating high-dimensional covariances developed in this project is analyzed theoretically and tested and validated in these applications, and in turn,  the directions in which the project develops at later stages are influenced by the issues and needs of the applications.

The main project outlined seeks to develop a Delzant theory to classify completely integrable systems on compact manifolds with real algebraic type singularities of their action variables. These are meant to include the systems arising from spherical varieties (Gelfand-Cetlin examples) and those from quiver varieties at a minimum. The key tool would be Bohr-Sommerfeld level sets and their interplay with the geometry of the moment map in Hamiltonian dynamics. Other topics to be treated include regularity of exterior Monge-Ampere solutions and their relation to pluripotential theory; asymptotic geometry at infinity of complex manifolds, and renormalized Chern classes on them; some cases of the Hodge conjecture related to special Hodge-classes on higher dimensional complex manifolds derived from K3 surfaces, and the algebraicization of certain Grauert tubes.    Philosophically, the first project is based on an idea going back to the beginning of quantum mechanics: the Bohr-Sommerfeld levels of a mechanical system, the set of configurations of a classical mechanical system which would contribute significantly to a quantum mechanical understanding of the system, as in, e.g., spectral lines of atoms. There was a later dual description of mechanics in terms of wave functions, and relating the two has been a source of great insight in physics and mathematics. What we suspect we have found, and are trying to prove, is that this Bohr-Sommerfeld correspondence underlies certain classification questions in classical mechanical  systems: how many integrable systems are there? The Bohr-Sommerfeld levels are related directly to classical loci on the underlying space of the mechanical system, while the corresponding wave functions allow one to read off the algebraic geometry of the system. The main problem proposed is to make this ""correspondence"" rigorous, to the point where the systems can be classified by the combinatorial relations among the Bohr-Sommerfeld loci, and some global algebraic geometric data.",Daniel Burns|

Specifically, it develops global network models and also deals with clustering of extreme values. A number of associated statistical issues, such as network-wide prediction, identifiability of parameters of interest and efficient estimation of the Hurst, tail and extremal indices are also investigated. The proposed global network models are based on a physically interpretable 'bottom-up' approach, where first a low level model is constructed for each source-destination pair of network nodes and subsequently the trafficis aggregated. Under certain limiting regimes, when the number of users grows and with appropriate rescaling of time, a limit approximation of the fluctuations of the network-wide traffic is obtained that is based on functional fractional Brownian motion, a novel class of Gaussian processes. The limit process captures traffic dependencies induced by the topology of the network. In a related direction, the study of clustering of extreme values is undertaken and a number of new estimators for the key parameter of the extremal index are investigated. This provides a new perspective in the study of burstiness in network traffic. Further, a flexible non-asymptotic model of the times between extremes is proposed, which allows better prediction of the frequency at which extreme values occur.    The current work is motivated by problems in modern computer networks, where there is a lot of interest in characterizing traffic fluctuations and burstiness, in order to identify bottleneck links and detect network failures in the form of routing faults or malicious activities. The proposed global network-wide models that take into consideration the network topology together with the temporal dependence in a principled manner allow one to achieve these goals. Further, the development of new methodology for the clustering-of-extremes phenomenon will prove useful in assessing the presence and impact of burstiness in network traffic. The understanding and insight gained as a result of the proposed research will lead to a core of basic principles for network traffic analysis. Understanding better and quantifying the clustering-of-extreme phenomenon will have a broad impact on measuring risk, by incorporating the temporal dependence in extreme financial losses. Finally, the proposed models and techniques will be integrated into open source tools.",Stilian Stoev|George Michailidis

This project investigates regression problems for which the response is scalar but some of the predictors are functional. The general goal is to gain understanding on the inference of the models based on partially observed and error-contaminated functional data. Distinctions will be made between dense functional data, usually obtained from images, and sparse functional data, usually obtained from longitudinal studies. The specific topics include the consideration of (i) a functional generalized linear model for dense functional data using a penalized likelihood approach, (ii) dimension reduction methodologies based on sliced inverse regression and sliced average variance estimation, and (iii) a functional generalized linear model for sparse functional data using an approximated quasi-likelihood approach. New approaches will be proposed in the consideration of these problems, and asymptotic theories will be proved to validate the approaches.  The sparse functional generalized linear model will be considered in a framework of joint modeling between a longitudinal life style profile and an endpoint health outcome. This involves the study of a new type of error-in-variable problem, which is expected to extend the horizon of longitudinal-data modeling.    An important current focal point of statistical research is the so-called high-dimensional data analysis. Indeed, high-dimensional data are a fact of life. This is evidenced by our increasing need for larger storage devices on our computers. Roughly speaking, functional data are high-dimensional data which can be approximated by smooth curves or functions. Such data are abundant in scientific investigations, and it is of crucial importance to be able to effectively analyze such data. The PI will investigate approaches that will fundamentally contribute to the practice of functional data analysis. Direct applications of the research can be found in areas including image analysis, bioinformatics, and medicine.

These summaries suggest that in the future, rising temperatures will be accompanied by increased precipitation, mostly as rain: 20% more over the Arctic as a whole and up to 30% more in coastal areas during the winter and autumn. These climate changes will have important impacts on Arctic Systems. Of direct interest to this research is the likelihood that warming will promote permafrost degradation and thaw. Formerly frozen soils may be further destabilized by increased precipitation, leading to hillslope thermokarst failures. Recent work has documented that thermokarst failures are abundant and appear to have become more numerous around Toolik Lake on the eastern North Slope and in the western Noatak River basin in Alaska. A widespread and long-term increase in the incidence of thermokarst failures may have important impacts on the structure and function of arctic headwater landscapes. This research will use a systems approach to address hypotheses about how thermokarst failures influence the structure and function of the arctic landscape. It will focus on the composition of vegetation, the distribution and processing of soil nutrients, and exports of sediments and nutrients to stream and lake ecosystems. Results obtained at this hillslope scale will be linked to patterns observed at the landscape scale to test hypotheses about the spatial distribution of thermokarst failures in the arctic foothills. It is important to understand these interactions because perhaps the greatest potential impacts of changing land surface processes and formation of thermokarst failures are feedbacks to the climate system through energy, albedo, water, and trace gas exchange.    This research is designed to quantify linkages among climatology, hillslope hydrology, geomorphology, geocryology, community ecology of vegetation, soil nutrient dynamics, microbial ecology, trace gas dynamics, and aquatic ecology. It will employ a combination of field experimentation, remote sensing, and simulation modeling as a means to quantify these relationships.",George Kling|

The specific problems are motivated by several key issues in astrophysics, in particular, the analysis of the dynamics of dark matter halos, galactic bulges, and extra-solar planetary systems. At the same time, this project will undertake new research directions concerning several classic problems of current interest in applied mathematics, including the analysis of the stochastically forced Hill's equation, analysis of the asymptotics of the eigenvalues of random matrices, and the dynamics of particles in non-Newtonian potentials.  The proposal consists of three interrelated parts. The first pertains to the analysis of orbital instabilities that arise in the dynamics of test particles in extended mass distributions such as dark matter halos.  Our analysis leads to a stochastically forced Hill's equation which can be studied by analyzing infinite products of random matrices. The second part discusses the role of turbulence in extra-solar planetary systems and leads to the study of stochastic pendulum problems. The long term dynamics of these systems can also be described by a discrete map with random parameters.  The final part considers the phenomenon of tidal stripping in dark matter halos. This work involves the study of orbits of small halos as they fall into larger ones, including dynamical friction and its effects on orbital dynamics. Here, the overarching goal is to understand the nearly universal form found for the matter density profiles, and in particular how they are affected by smaller halos being assimilated into larger structures.    The field of astrophysics has experienced an unprecedented number of observational discoveries and theoretical breakthroughs in the past decade. These discoveries include super-massive black holes in galactic centers, the accelerating universe, measurement of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, extra-solar planets, and brown dwarfs.  The observational progress has been made possible through technological innovations, including detectors, telescopes, and spacecraft. Much of the theoretical progress has taken place through numerical simulations, which in turn have benefited from the ever-growing capabilities of computers.  Unfortunately, however, the third pillar of this science --- the analytic understanding of these newly discovered astronomical objects and physical phenomena --- is lagging behind. One of the difficulties associated with analytic work in this area is the enormous complexity of the astrophysical systems under study. In particular, chaotic dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions arise in many contexts and render it difficult to make progress through the traditional analytic methods used by astrophysicists. However, the development and application of new mathematical tools, as proposed herein, will facilitate progress on these astrophysical issues, and will be useful in many additional applications.

Lippmann Research Center in Luxembourg and two at the Materials Science Department of the University of Michigan (UM).  This partnership merges resources that are not available to each participant individually.  The purpose of this research is to investigate the shape, compositional definition, and energetics of interfaces in vapor-deposited multi-layer organic semiconductor thin films and devices fabricated by one of the UM groups.  The increasing sophistication of optoelectronic devices requires molecular-level dimensional control in the fabrication of multi-layered structures with specifically engineered interfaces. However, the effectiveness of growth and doping strategies devised to achieve the desired device structures oftentimes remains unverified due to the lack adequate characterization techniques. This is particularly true for devices based on conjugated organic compounds, which find increasing use in energy applications (e.g. organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic cells, etc.). The buried interfaces are simply inaccessible or suffer damage when using conventional characterization techniques.  Low-energy secondary ion mass spectrometry (LE-SIMS), a specialty of the SAM group, provides a promising avenue for the analysis of organic-based thin-film layered structures, because sub-keV impact energies of the primary ions result in reduced fragmentation of molecular species at the specimen surface.  The physics of the collision cascades and the processes that lead to the ejection of secondary ions at low energies is still poorly understood, and a unified formalism for the identification of ejected species does not yet exist.  Pursuing this knowledge, the other UM group combines large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the detailed atomic trajectories in collision cascades and predict the nature of ejected molecular fragments.  This computational framework serves to interpret experimental data obtained from LE-SIMS, thereby improving the depth resolution of the technique and its ability to reliably identify organic molecular species, thus further establishing LE-SIMS as a technique for depth-profiling organic thin film materials.    The goal of this project is to establish the relationship between growth conditions, structure, and properties of multi-layer thin film organic semiconductors with unprecedented precision.  Fundamental insights for the advancement of organic electronic device design and fabrication techniques are anticipated.  The project serves as the basis for three Ph.D. theses.

The goal is to generate the turbulent substructure needed to create the dense concentrations which ultimately form stars as a result of various instabilities in post-shock gas, rather than put this substructure in ''by hand''. The turbulence generated by these instabilities will be modified by global flows generated by self-gravity; such flows can produce mid-scale concentrations of mass leading to the formation of star clusters.  The program will involve a series of calculations of increasing complexity, including molecule formation and other chemistry, cooling at high densities, self-gravity, and the effects of magnetic fields. Detailed radiative transfer calculations will be employed to compare in detail with observations of molecular clouds.    This project will attempt to answer the following questions: Do instabilities which arise naturally in flow-driven molecular cloud formation produce a mass spectrum of dense concentrations consistent with observations of protostellar cores? Do these initial perturbations solely determine the core mass function, or is there significant gravitational merging/coagulation? Is the resulting core spectrum consistent with the stellar initial mass function, or must there be additional fragmentation? How does the environment (metallicities, flow parameters) affect the fragmentation and thus the initial mass function? And how do magnetic fields affect the formation of protostellar cores within flow-formed molecular clouds? These questions are of direct importance to understanding star formation and the origin of the stellar initial mass function.    The results of this project will have application to research in the areas of galaxy mergers and star formation at low metallicities because the mechanism of colliding flows is not limited to current Galactic star formation.

The project will be carried out using the newly commissioned Michigan Infra-Red Combiner, which links all six telescopes of the Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) optical interferometer at Mt. Wilson in California. CHARA's imaging capabilities will be extended even further using a new fringe tracker also developed by Dr. Monnier. This will be used to ""phase up"" the array at one wavelength while observing in another - a kind of adaptive optics for interferometry.    The scientific focus of this project is to exploit the new order-of-magnitude improvement of sensitivity for imaging the inner disks of young stellar objects in the process of planet formation. Initial observations of young stars using a two-telescope combiner at CHARA have already revealed surprisingly strong emission from inside the dust destruction radius, tentatively associated with hot gas. Other evidence is also accumulating that the inner regions of accretion disks are quite dynamic and time-variable, and imaging will provide a uniquely powerful tool for discovering the source of these changes. This research promises to uncover connections between jet eruptions and disk instabilities, likely critical for understanding planet formation and subsequent migration. Because orbital time scales are less than about a year in the inner disk, the multi-epoch studies to be carried out should reveal the orbital motion of any clumps or inhomogeneities.    Imaging is a general-purpose capability that is lacking in visible and infrared interferometry, and is only now possible with current facilities and new beam combination techniques. The software and data analysis tools developed in this project will be available to the whole community and can be applied to diverse areas of stellar astronomy beyond this project.    The advances in infrared interferometry have been made possible through the improvement in infrared detectors. As experimentalists and IR camera builders, Dr. Monnier and his team will share these exciting developments with the greater public through an innovative portable exhibit concept based around today's new thermal infrared cameras. Partnering with the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum, a portable visible-infrared stereo camera system, deployable in a variety of teaching environments, will be developed. This engaging learning tool will allow students of all ages to explore their Universe with ""new eyes.""",John Monnier|Theo ten Brummelaar|Rafael Millan-Gabet

Such equations describe wave propagation in situations when signals travel at finite speed, e.g. acoustics, electromagnetism, compressible fluids, ... etc. The first set of problems concerns nonlinear internal layers. Such layers represent waves which have wave fronts occupying a very thin region about a smooth surface in space time. The wave front separates regions where the values of the solution are quite different. The examples of propagating flame fronts and reaction fronts give the idea. The mathematical results will lead to algorithms for approximations whose error tends to zero as the width decreases. The problem proposed is the behavior of planar layers at times which are large relative to the reciprocal of the width. One expects to see diffractive effects and there are virtually no known mathematical results for this type for layers. It is likely that there will be analogous results for weakly dissipative boundary layers. The second problems concern Berenger?s perfectly matched layer algorithms for the computation of wave propagation in unbounded domains. Careful analysis indicates that the layers are not perfectly matched. The detailed analysis of this phenomenon and its consequences is important given the wide use of these methods. The third family of problems concern situations where stability estimates are derived with the aid of pseudodifferential operators. Such operators spread supports which makes them seemingly inappropriate for the study of supports. The project proposes the study of sharp finite speed and uniqueness of the Cauchy problem at space like hypersurfaces for symmetrizable hyperbolic systems. Finally the propagation of short wavelength waves through perturbed periodic media will be studied when the period and wavelength are of comparable size. The interest is in propagation for long distances on which diffractive effects are expected to take place.    This research project addresses questions that arise in mathematical models for wave propagation phenomena, i.e. physical situations in which signals can travel at finite speed and interact with one another and with the medium that they traverse. Such signals can take the form of wave fronts (such as the spherical light flash from a camera, sound waves made by clapping hands, or a flame front in a combustion engine) or of rays (as in optics), among others. There is a common class of mathematical models for such phenomena that has been employed very successfully in applications as diverse as chemical engineering, the design and use of radar equipment and ultrasound transceivers, computer graphics, and fiber optics. There are four parts to this project. The first will add to the understanding of models for wave fronts that interact. The second part will examine a very widely used computational method for wave phenomena in unbounded spatial regions (e.g. radar signals bouncing off a plane) and try to explain some anomalies that make this method less reliable than is generally assumed. In the third part, the proposer will establish that a wide class of models does indeed exhibit the finite signal speed in all possible situations. Finally, the fourth project aims at a better understanding of light signals that travel through photonic materials over long distances. The PI will continue his educational efforts through lecture series, published notes, counseling, mentoring of thesis students, and close contact with laboratories in engineering schools and industry.",Jeffrey Rauch|

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3.   Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.    Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component.",Anna Amirdjanova|

There are two complementary aspects of this work:  asymptotic analysis in the scattering theory of linear differential equations, and asymptotic analysis of the corresponding inverse problems.  The particular application problems to be studied along the way include (i) the semiclassical limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation, (ii) the corresponding semiclassical limit of the modified nonlinear Schrodinger equation, (iii) the semiclassical limit of the sine-Gordon equation in laboratory coordinates, (iv) the continuum limit of the Ablowitz-Ladik equations, (v) singular limits for multicomponent integrable equations, and (vi) several asymptotic problems in approximation theory with applications to random matrix theory.    This work is interesting and important because it will promote understanding of singular limits leading formally to ill-posed dynamical systems.  Indeed, the motivating problem of the semiclassical limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation with general smooth but nonanalytic initial data remains one of the most important open problems in applied analysis, and the tools developed as part of this project will directly address this problem and other similar ones.  Furthermore, while the basic aim of the project is the development of methods of analysis, the methods will also be applied to several specific integrable equations and also to open problems beyond the field of nonlinear waves.  For example, we intend to apply specialized asymptotic methods developed in the context of nonlinear wave theory to the problem of the asymptotic analysis (in the bulk scaling limit) of the correlation functions of the normal random matrix model, with its coincident connections to the theory of Laplacian growth (also known as Hele-Shaw flow) and conformal mapping.  Many of the problems addressed as part of this project have a universal character, arising in the modeling of diverse physical phenomena, and it follows that analytical techniques applicable to these problems have far-reaching consequences.  This project also has an educational component, stressing the training of postdocs and graduate students through collaborative research and course development.",Peter Miller|

By careful studies of stellar motion, the group will improve measurements of the total mass present in nearby dwarf galaxies, and test whether they are being pulled apart by gravitational forces from neighbor galaxies.  In more distant galaxies, they will measure motions of the surrounding globular star clusters to estimate the mass of the galaxy and hence of its dark matter.  The group will collaborate with statisticians to analyze and interpret their results.

V.   Inst: University of Illinois Michigan      Abstract:  The human eye is often capable of identifying interesting patterns and trends from a well-presented data set, whereas computational algorithms may have difficulties with such a task. Yet, there are limits to human ability, both with the scale of the data set in terms of objects and attributes and with dynamic changes over time. This project develops an analytic and computational framework to support the visual analysis of large-scale dynamic data with network structure.     The intellectual merit of this project is in the development of a family of operators with which to reduce the size both in terms of objects and attributes of the data set to be visualized; an analysis of the properties of this family of operators to enable their effective use; and the development of algorithms and data structures to support the ef&#64257;cient computation of these operators. By harnessing computational power to assist the human eye in seeing patterns and trends in the data, this project has the potential to transform the way in which large dynamic data sets with network structure are analyzed today.     The broader impact of the project lies in the multiple application domains where network data are ubiquitous in their presence. In particular, we plan to focus on two domains to illustrate the proposed framework; biology through protein interaction networks, and national intelligence through social networks of suspect participants. In addition, this interdisciplinary project plows the ground at the boundary of statistics and computer science, and trains graduate students at this interface, an area with great future potential.",H.

The theoretical properties as well as practical implementation issues of this approach will be thoroughly explored. The completion of this project will provide powerful new tools for kriging, or optimal prediction in certain situations in spatial data analysis. Based on the relationship between the generalized covariance and the spectral density, a new approach is formulated for estimating the spectral density in terms of solving a regularized inverse problem. The generalized covariance can then be estimated thorough the estimated spectral density, which paves the way for kriging. The regularized inverse problem is solved in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space essentially as a constrained optimization problem. A number of crucial issues arise from that. Candidate procedures based on the ideas of unbiased-risk and generalized cross-validation will be studied for the determination of the optimal smoothing parameters from data. Theoretical properties, including mean squared error bounds and asymptotic properties, will be investigated to assess the performance of the approach. Efficient computational algorithms will be sought to overcome the difficulties brought by the high-dimensional nature of the data.    The research in this project offers a new perspective on the analysis of spatial data. The kind of data that the investigator has in mind are data observed at multiple spatial locations and possibly also at multiple time points. The general goals are to identify the data generation process and to make predictions beyond the spatial-temporal region where data are available. One of the keys in such problems is to understand the dependence relationship between the various pieces of the data. The approach in this project targets this problem for a broad class of models. Potential applications of the new theory and methodology exist in numerous contexts, including the environment, geography, and sensor networks.",Tailen Hsing|

Exposure of these rocks to seawater results in uptake of H2O and elements such as Cl, B, S, and C. For example, S can be enriched by qne to two orders of magnitude compared to depleted mantle peridotites (~0.1- 1 wt% vs. ~0.01 wt%, respectively), and S isotopes are significantly fractionated from the mantle value d34S = from -43 to +13 permil vs ~0 permil, respectively). Serpentinites also contain significant amounts of organic carbon, with TOC (Total Organic Carbon) values up to 2700 ppm, having d13C values down to -30 permil. The addition of sulfide and TOC to the rocks results from hydrothermal and microbial processes over a range of temperatures.  Recycling of serpentinites in subduction zones can transport water and seawater components to sub-arc depths, where they can influence arc magmatism and/or return these components to the deep mantle. This process may also influence S and C isotope compositions of subduction zone magmas, and contribute to isotopic heterogeneities of S and C in the mantle. Because these processes are poorly understood, it is proposed to examine the contents and isotope compositions of S and C in ultramafic rocks of Tethyan ophiolites that have experienced variable P-T conditions during subduction metamorphism. Overall goals are to understand: (a) seafloor serpentinization processes in these rocks; (b) the behavior of these elements during subduction and high-pressure metamorphism; and (c) the extent to which these elements are recycled through arc volcanism vs. returned to the deeper mantle. The following hypotheses will be evaluated: (1a) Microbial reduction of seawater sulfate during low-temperature serpentinization on the seafloor can result in elevated S and TOC contents and low (negative) d34S and d13CTOC values for serpentinites.  (1b) Serpentinization associated with local gabbroic intrusions may have occurred at higher temperatures, leading to elevated sulfide-S contents and d34S values. (2a) Sulfur losses from serpentinites during high-P dehydration reactions result in little isotope fractionation. (2b) TOC is retained during dehydration reactions,.  These hypotheses will be tested through analyses of whole rock contents and isotope compositions of S and TOC in variably metamorphosed serpentinites, and through petrographic and chemical analyses of individual opaque phases (sulfides, oxides, and carbonaceous material) in the rocks. Samples will be from Tethyan ophiolites in the Northern Appenines, the Voltri Group in the Ligurian Alps, and the Almirez massif in the Betic Cordillera.    BROADER IMPACTS.

This range has long been speculated to play a central role in accommodating oblique convergence within the collision. Recent GPS studies indicate shortening rates of 10 to 13 mm/yr across the easternmost Greater Caucasus, which represents 50 to 85% of the total 15 to 20 mm/yr of far-field Arabia-Eurasia convergence. Although GPS and earthquake data clearly imply that the eastern Greater Caucasus now plays a central role in accommodating Arabia-Eurasia convergence, current available data are insufficient to confidently determine if strain has been similarly focused in the range throughout the late Cenozoic. In this three-year project, an international team of scientists from the United States, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and the Russian Federation is testing the hypotheses that: 1) the Greater Caucasus range is a first-order structural system that formed by strain localization within the Arabia-Eurasia collision; 2) surface uplift began approximately 10 million years ago due to focusing of 50 to 80% of total Arabia-Eurasia convergence in the range; 3) the timing and magnitude of both exhumation and shortening systematically decrease from west to east along-strike due to eastward propagation of the range; and 4) strain localization within the Greater Caucasus may be the result of the consumption of a relict ocean basin, of which the Black and South Caspian seas are remnants, that was trapped during formation of the orogen in the late Cenozoic. These hypotheses are tested through a field-based, integrated structural, neotectonic, and thermochronologic study of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and the Kura fold-thrust belt, which flanks the southeastern margin of the range in Georgia and Azerbaijan.    Almost 40 years after the advent of the theory of plate tectonics, earth scientists are still debating how continents deform when they collide along the boundary between two converging plates. Addressing this question is important for understanding where, how often, and why deformation is suddenly released during earthquakes along faults, how those faults form and behave over time, why they form in some places and not others.  The ongoing collision between the Eurasian and Arabian continents produced the highest mountain range in Europe, and the second largest region of active continental collision on Earth. The center of this collision is defined by the Greater Caucasus Mountains, which extend for approximately 1000 km between the Black Sea to the west and Caspian Sea to the east. This mountain belt appears to have formed in only the last 5 to 10 million years, thus providing an unusual opportunity to study the initial stages of continental deformation and mountain building. Results from this research will advance the understanding of continental deformation, the geological conditions in this region that led to the formation of rich oil reserves in the South Caspian basin and eastern Azerbaijan, and the earthquake hazards in this heavily populated and economically important region.

The first concerns modeling and  efficient simulation of heteroepitaxial growth using kinetic Monte Carlo   and will build from prior NSF support which resulted in the  development of a Fourier multigrid method for the fast solution of  discrete elastic equations for complex geometries.  This work will be   extended to develop methods for obtaining inexpensive upper bonds on  rates, the use of local computations for elastic equations, and the inclusion of  intermixing of multiple species.  The second project involves the   simulation of grain boundary motion in two and three dimensions using  a recently developed multiphase variational level set framework which  allows one to systematically deduce level set equations for a network of  grains moving under curvature flow. We plan to extend this formulation to   allow the simulation of thousands of seeds by using only a few level set  functions.  The efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation   and the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation is the third  project. The proposed algorithm is based on the observation that most of   the time, in these limiting regimes, the solutions are very localized   in the wavenumber domain. This can be exploited by solving the equations in this  domain using a fast local convolution. It is planned to update the solutions  by  the computation of the matrix exponential using a Krylov subspace  approach.    Each of the proposed projects has the potential to have a significant impact   on problems that are both fundamental and technologically important.   Heteroepitaxial growth is scientifically interesting since it has effects  on both nanoscales and mesoscales.  It is technologically relevant since  quantum dot materials are made in this way.  Our proposed techniques will  greatly increase the simulation speed  thereby facilitating  model development.  The study of grain boundary motion using curvature flow is a classic problem   in applied and computational mathematics which has importance in material s  cience. Since there are no robust simulations of a large number grains in   three dimensions the proposed project should have significant impact.   The efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation has important   facets ranging from antenna design to seismic sensing.  On the other hand,  fast simulation of the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation   could  provide deeper insight into chemical reaction dynamics,   molecular-surface scattering, and photodissociation, for example.",Peter Smereka|

Proposal Number: DMS - 0810844   Institution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor   Title: Commutative Algebra and its Interactions      This proposal is for a conference that will take place at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, July 31--August 5, 2008. The conference will focus on recent advances in commutative algebra, centered around areas which have been greatly influenced by the contributions of Mel Hochster. These include tight closure, singularities and multiplier ideals, the homological conjectures, invariant theory, local cohomology, the structure of free resolutions, and combinatorial commutative algebra. Hochster's research has had a transforming impact on the field, and there are several highly active areas which rely on his past and present work. We hope to bring together these areas for fruitful interaction. Commutative algebra is the study of equations: to paraphrase Hochster, ""...algebra, after all, has to do with solving equations. Abstract algebra is the daughter of the theory of equations (in the broadest sense) and perhaps its best theorems still deal with that subject."" Striking developments in the last few decades in commutative algebra have reinforced this view of commutative algebra. These developments include solutions to classical problems, as well as strengthened connections with diverse areas including algebraic topology, group cohomology, algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, invariant theory, and algebraic and arithmetic geometry. The invited speakers include experts in different areas, as well as several young researchers. The conference will provide an opportunity to present key results and recent advances. A special effort will be made to support the expenses of young researchers, women and minorities, graduate students, and those without alternative means of support.",Karen Smith|Craig Huneke|Anurag Singh

In order for software applications to benefit from the continued exponential throughput advances in multicore processors, the applications must be well-written multithreaded software programs. Unfortunately, writing multithreaded software programs that can unleash the full potential of present and future hardware systems remains as challenging today as it was thirty years ago. This research aims to develop practical tools and methodologies that can bring down the complexity of testing/debugging multithreaded programs to a level comparable to that of testing/debugging sequential programs. To this end, existing debugging tools have to be enhanced with powerful reasoning engines that allow them to implicitly analyze all possible thread interleavings under the specified test inputs. During the course of this project a variety of approaches to achieve this objective will be investigated, including some novel ideas that seem particularly promising from a preliminary analysis: (1) efficient symbolic encoding of multithreaded programs, (2) trace-driven abstraction and refinement of their execution, and (3) performance enhancement techniques that allow this approach to scale to realistic program sizes.",Karem Sakallah|

Unfortunately, providing multiple cores does not directly translate into performance for most codes. To make use of multicore, many new languages have been proposed to ease the burden of writing parallel programs, yet the programming effort involved in creating correct and efficient parallel programs is still far more substantial than writing the equivalent single-threaded version. A more attractive approach is to rely on tools, both compilers and runtime optimizers, to automatically extract threads from sequential applications. Unfortunately, despite decades of research on automatic parallelization, most techniques have only been effective in the scientific and data-parallel domains. With recently gained insight, the investigators showed that the limits of prior thread-extraction approaches are not fundamental. By applying known and new compilation techniques in a systematic manner, the investigators found that SPEC CINT2000, among the most sequential of codes, has abundant scalable parallelism.    In this project, the team of investigators is taking the initial steps toward developing the techniques necessary to build an automatic thread extraction framework. These techniques include developing static transformations that extract parallelism and quantifying the opportunities for dynamic optimization. The system will ultimately consist of a series of static transformations and compiler-inserted hints combined with a run-time optimization component.  This framework will address the multicore challenge by reliably extracting parallelism from a wide range of applications without burdening the programmer with what should remain to be low-level implementation details.",Scott Mahlke|

As much as 40% of this energy is wasted because of two key inefficiencies: (1) the substantial energy used by idle equipment that is powered on, but not performing useful work, and (2) inefficiency in data-center cooling infrastructure arising from a poor match between where heat is generated and where cool air is supplied. This project proposes research on a data-center-wide management system that controls IT equipment, power, and cooling infrastructure in real time to save energy in two ways. First, it actively consolidates computing tasks onto fewer systems, allowing idle systems to be powered down. Second, it moves computing tasks to systems that can be cooled most efficiently.

The desired outcome is a cohesive approach that improves chip lifetimes via both better estimation at design time (leading to reduced design margining, and therefore design times and costs) and circuit-based techniques that enable post-fabrication monitoring and improvement of robustness during the lifetime of a given die. The key components of this work include: 1) a tool that statistically determines expected chip-level reliability, 2) a theoretically rigorous approach that uses a small number of post-silicon measurements on a wafer to improve the reliability/performance characteristics of a larger set of chips, 3) new ultra-compact on-chip sensors to monitor reliability mechanisms with low overhead and compatibility with modern design methodologies, 4) a novel indirect measurement scheme based on the quiescent current draw of a chip to monitor for wearout, 5) design styles to combat very high intrinsic failure rates (e.g., 1 in 1000 devices fail).     The proposed strategy to improve reliability in highly variable nanoscale CMOS will facilitate sustained improvement in the performance and robustness of integrated circuits - a necessary condition for the continued evolution of semiconductor and information technology. In particular, higher functional and parametric yields will enable lower costs, which will largely benefit cost-constrained markets such as wireless/mobile. The impact of this work will be enhanced by leveraging promising undergraduate researchers, through improvements in curriculum, and through industrial interaction via class project mentoring. At the graduate level, this research will involve several students pursuing doctoral and master?s degrees, training them directly to conduct research in this area. The knowledge developed under the proposed research will be incorporated in VLSI CAD and circuits courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Seminars and tutorials presented at the departmental level, at conferences, and at other universities will play an important role in disseminating the knowledge gained from this research, along with conventional publication in top journals and international conferences.",Dennis Sylvester|David Blaauw

The goal of this project is to develop general techniques for the design of manipulation-resistant recommender systems as well as specific solutions for applications in which such a recommender could have a significant impact. The applications studied include Internet sites that use user-provided ratings or tags to recommend items to users, and a recommendation system for job candidates that aggregates informal information from former employees and colleagues.     The project uses three research methods: (1) Theoretical modeling and analysis of provably robust mechanisms, building on techniques from economic mechanism design and online learning; (2) Simulations of such mechanisms against known attack strategies; and (3) Empirical tests on recommendation datasets. The results and software will also be used to enrich a Masters-level course on recommender systems, and related courses.    A manipulation-resistant recommender algorithm will be valuable to numerous Internet organizations, allowing them to offer reliable recommendations without obtaining and verifying personal information. The development of a recommendation mechanism for job candidates will directly benefit both employers and candidates, especially those who lack formal credentials.

Plant defenses range from physical defenses, like thorns, spines, and tough leaves, to chemical defenses such as cyanide and steroids.  As plants try to defend themselves, most of them make use of nutrients that are provided to them by fungi (called mycorrhizae) that live in their roots.  In what is basically a barter system, plants provide the fungi with sugar while the fungi provide plants with minerals such as phosphorus.  The strength of plant defenses may vary with the amount of fungus in their roots and the identity of their fungal partners, but this has never been studied in detail.    Using common milkweed as a study plant, this research explores how the strength of plant defense varies with the fungal colonization of roots.  It examines how variation in plant and fungal identity contributes to defense, and how natural variation in soil nutrients influences the barter system.  Experiments also explore the effects of root fungi on insect herbivores.  The results of this work will contribute to an understanding of how diverse plant species, from agricultural crops through forest trees, use root fungi in their defense strategies.

The goal of the project is to obtain a clearer understanding of the relationships between carbon dynamics, land-management activities, and market and non-market values of land-uses and land-covers ? focusing on how carbon dynamics might respond in a non-linear fashion to various management and policy options for land-cover management.  Building on the extensive data resources developed under a precursor project, the researchers will use dynamic agent-based models (including a new land-market sub model) to examine a range of exurban land-cover patterns that might be expected to result from market and policy drivers These models will be linked to homeowner preferences and landscape management behaviors from surveys. The outputs of the models will be coupled with a spatially explicit model of biogeochemistry, with inputs derived from remote sensing and field-based sampling within Southeastern Michigan. The researchers will explore the relationship between decision processes by various actors and the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes. We will look for the existence of ecologically significant thresholds (e.g., large, nonlinear land-atmosphere carbon exchange in response to small changes in policy, preferences or behaviors) that are revealed in the coupled system. The study will identify both modeled micro-level dynamics and macro-level patterns in space and time, building on data and model resources developed from previous projects, while creating a complementary new dataset to support modeling of land-market interactions that includes land transactions, biogeochemical processes, cultural preferences and management practices affecting land covers,     The complex feedbacks explored in this project, that both drive and result from exurban sprawl, will provide new insights into how policy can be used to guide and manage this landscape change.  Coupled  computer models will be used to evaluate policy scenarios that may be spatially-targeted (e.g., zoning) or aspatial (e.g., carbon credits) and are designed to affect carbon dynamics through mechanisms built on an understanding of the incentives created by markets and preferences and behaviors of residents, developers, and local governments.  Field and modeling work on soil and vegetation carbon dynamics will provide much needed insights into the effects of exurban development on carbon storage, which, given the growth of exurban development, has important implications for the atmospheric carbon budget.

An interdisciplinary team of scientists will investigate the interaction between climate warming and simulated atmospheric N deposition using a long-term, regional-based, field experiment located in sugar maple-dominated forest ecosystems common throughout eastern North America.  Over the past 10 years, simulated atmospheric nitrogen deposition at rates expected to occur by 2050 have increased tree growth and slowed the decay of dead leaves and roots, increasing the amount of carbon stored in this wide-spread ecosystem.  However, it is uncertain whether carbon storage will stabilize at a higher equilibrium over the long-term as atmospheric nitrogen deposition increases, or whether expected warming will counteract this effect.

This group contrast allows the impact of first grade instruction to be differentiated from maturation and school attendance.",Frederick Morrison|

The primary project activities are creating, disseminating, and assessing teaching materials that make it easy for instructors to integrate data analysis in non-methodology courses.  The goal is to reduce the ""quantitative reasoning gap"" between what students learn in early courses and the importance of empirical research in the social sciences.  The partners in this project are building upon two extant sources of data (1) the Social Science Data Analysis Network (SSDAN), which distributes teaching modules based on US Census data, and (2) the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the world's largest social science data archive.      A second goal of the project is to recruit experienced faculty members to develop new tools for assessing student learning and to conduct assessments in their classes. These assessment tools are intended for distribution with existing and new teaching materials.  New software and teaching strategies are being developed to simplify complex data for presentation to undergraduates.     A third goal is to provide training for faculty members to introduce them to the characteristics of new data sets, relevant statistical techniques, teaching strategies, and assessment procedures. Much of the dissemination to end users is taking place through the use of cost-effective Webinars. The communication resources of the American Sociological Association, the American Political Science Association, the National Numeracy Network, and the more than 600 colleges, universities, and research institutions who are members of ICPSR are to be mobilized to disseminate information about new teaching materials. Web sites are to be enhanced to help faculty form teaching communities within disciplines. This approach is expected to help bring about a transformative change in the ways that undergraduates encounter and understand the role of research in the social sciences.",William Frey|George Alter

Human progress is marked by a search for understanding principles that apply broadly across varying instances within a category.  A fundamental means of expressing general knowledge to children is via language, and in particular generic noun phrases (e.g., ""Insects are 6-legged"").  Prior work has demonstrated that generic noun phrases are frequent in parental speech to children, used in diverse cultural and linguistic contexts (U.S., China, Peru), produced by children exposed to minimal linguistic input (deaf children not exposed to sign language), understood appropriately by preschool-aged children, and stored by children in long-term memory.  These component pieces all suggest that generics are important, meaningful, acquired early, and have the potential to influence children's world knowledge.  However, prior work on generics leaves two major questions unanswered:  (1) Does generic language affect and guide children's concepts, or does generic language merely reflect children's concepts?  (2) What is the process by which generic language is acquired in childhood?  The project will investigate both these core issues.  An in-depth training study will teach young children a new concept under varied wording conditions to chart the effects of generics and labeling on children's categorical reasoning.  Furthermore, a set of experiments will test competing claims regarding the process by which generics are learned.  These studies will make use of experimental research and naturalistic language analyses to provide converging and precise evidence regarding the links among concepts and language in children between 2 and 5 years of age.    The project will promote more effective learning strategies by providing much-needed information on how the language that parents and teachers use (generic vs. specific) affects how children acquire and generalize new information.  These findings will help us understand better how children learn language, and have implications for science education.  Furthermore, understanding how and when children form generalizations within categories informs the development of stereotyping, as well as how children come to understand human diversity.  Finally, the work will benefit society at large, by providing scientists, educators, and parents with an understanding of children's early cognitive processes and the effects of language on such processes.  Understanding how these basic processes unfold in normally developing children also provides a framework for eventually understanding how they can go awry, for example, in children with specific language impairment.",Susan Gelman|

The answer to this question is crucial to understanding democracy. If negative campaign advertisements discourage citizens from voting, then political legitimacy is in question. This project shows when and why campaign negativity can discourage individuals from voting. More specifically, the project demonstrates that negative advertisements demobilize voters only under specific conditions.    Existing work on this topic has produced conflicting results. Some scholars claim that negative advertising demobilizes the electorate, while other scholars argue either that negative advertising actually increases turnout or does not have any particular effect on turnout.  This project contends that scholars have reached this empirical stalemate because existing research ignores two critical ideas: some individuals decide which candidate they prefer long before Election Day and negative information has a different effect before and after a person decides how to vote.  This study combines these two ideas to argue that negative advertising demobilizes voters, but only those who have decided which candidate they prefer. The project uses an experiment to test this process directly and survey data to demonstrate this pattern over seven elections.      On a broader level, this study suggests that campaigns that turn negative late in the election season may be more likely to lower voter turnout. In addition, my work provides a roadmap for practitioners. ""Going negative"" is a topic debated among campaign staffers because it is often unclear if and when negative ads aid candidates in their quest for office.  The research undertaken here helps deal with these uncertainties by clarifying how negative campaigning affects voters and which voters will be most susceptible to negativity.",Arthur Lupia|Yanna Krupnikov

This class of materials of-fers tunable electronic/optical properties which exhibit remarkable physical properties, and can be depos-ited as high quality thin films on a variety of substrates, including low cost glass and plastic, potentially enabling cost-effective, large-area electronics and energy conversion devices. In the course of research involving organic semiconductors, exotic molecules are engineered and synthesized, and subsequently incorporated into devices. Unfortunately, exploratory synthesis yields are often low (resulting in < 10-3 g quantities), and costs of device fabrication are high (> $105 for equipment). Moreover, the materials utili-zation efficiency of currently employed thin-film deposition techniques is often less than 0.01%, leading to a range of practical limitations on the pace of experimental exploration and increasing potential health hazards to the researchers.   To address these problems, we will develop a Guardflow-enhanced Organic Vapor Jet Printing (G-OVJP) deposition system that allows compact and cost-effective deposition with much higher (50%+) source material utilization. The vapor jet technique employs a carrier gas to deliver source molecules onto a substrate, increasing materials utilization by bringing the sample into close proximity of a collimated source. The specially designed guard flow shields the stream of the source material from the surround-ings, thereby allowing the deposition to take place in a highly localized inert environment, potentially enabling device printing in atmosphere.   The potential impact of the proposed work includes greatly reducing the cost-of-entry for organic op-toelectronics research, facilitating cross-disciplinary collaborations, enabling access to materials and mor-phologies not available via existing deposition techniques, and an accelerated pace of discovery in the realm of scientifically and technologically important organic semiconductors.     Non-technical Abstract:   A relatively novel class of carefully engineered organic materials derived from pigments is becoming increasingly important in science and technology. The accelerated pace and volume of research directed towards molecular organic semiconductors is motivated in large part by the ability to span a vast range of properties by means of chemical synthesis, and by the potential ability to cost-effectively fabricate futur-istic devices (e.g. ultra-thin bendable displays, efficient lighting wallpaper, plastic solar cells, health-monitoring devices, and others).   Unfortunately, present research activities are severely limited by the high costs of processing equip-ment, waste of exotic new materials due to inherent inefficiencies of the laboratory-scale processing methods employed, and the serial and slow nature of experimentation imposed by the current crop of processing equipment and methods.   The proposed research apparatus - Guardflow-enhanced Organic Vapor Jet Printer - will increase ma-terials utilization efficiency by orders of magnitude, free up laboratory space, reduce capital costs, im-prove safety, speed up laboratory-scale fabrication and testing of novel devices, and enhance scientific collaborations across traditional disciplinary boundaries. The benefits of this proposed work will extend beyond the research community, to undergraduate and K-12 education, by providing greatly simplified and more rewarding hands-on experiences in science and technology at the cutting edge of research in organic semiconductors and energy conversion devices.",Max Shtein|Kevin Pipe

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) project is especially well-positioned to study this wave of democratization.  The current project seeks support to complete the activities of the third module of the CSES, and to plan and design the fourth module.  The project encompasses the coordination and leadership of the social science research efforts of approximately 60 nations.    Now over ten years old, the CSES is a systematic cross-national study of comparative electoral behavior.  Theoretically informed, the project has the potential to transform the study of comparative politics; it has become accepted as one of the principal resources for scholars investigating cross-national public-opinion and political-behavioral research.  Involving the collaboration of more than 200 scholars, CSES advances the understanding of enduring and fundamental questions about electoral choice in ways not otherwise possible.  CSES coordinates the operation of approximately 60 national election studies across the world, thereby ensuring that information about citizens' behavior and attitudes gathered at each site is comparable.  The goals of this unique research program are: to illuminate how societal, political, and economic institutional and structural contexts, most especially electoral institutions, shape the beliefs and behaviors of citizens and condition the nature and quality of democratic choice as expressed through popular elections; to understand the nature of political and social divisions and alignments; and to shed light on how citizens living under diverse political arrangements evaluate democratic institutions and processes.    The CSES has broader impacts for both the academic and policymaking community.  In addition to the survey data, information about the institutional arrangements and other social-, political-, and economic-contextual conditions that characterize each participating country are also collected, again in comparable form.  CSES designs, receives, rationalizes, cleans and checks, and merges all of these data, and then makes them freely and immediately available to the world's scholarly community via the project website at: http://www.cses.org.  This public-use facility is a resource for comparative researchers worldwide, and that is reflected in the large and growing number of publications that utilize the data.    Only through the kind of comparative analysis that CSES makes possible, where comparable samples of citizens are observed with comparable instruments under different institutional settings, can the impact of institutions be properly ascertained and measured.  And only through genuinely comparative analysis can the merits and shortcomings of different democratic arrangements be discovered.  The output from the CSES has policy implications for the design and implementation of electoral systems around the world, as well as implications for the normative study of democracy.",Nancy Burns|Ian McAllister

Social interactions that ratify and shape social hierarchy can look superficially similar. This research investigates the possibility that apparent similarities may be misleading, if the social interactions simultaneously are being understood differently.    The research will be carried out in the region of Cuzco, Peru, chosen because it has an appropriate diversity of languages and ethnicities. The research will compare a community of Quechua-speaking herders on a former plantation, a community of Quechua-speaking agriculturalists, and an urban Spanish-speaking population from the city of Cuzco. The research methods include participant observation and description of daily interactions, during which the researcher will pay particular attention to non-verbal semiotic practices. The researcher also will conduct open-ended interviews with a sample of informants, and carry out sociolinguistic analysis of natural speech samples.    This research will go beyond identifying the practices that mediate the construction of differences and focus as well on the ideologies through which such practices are interpreted and which themselves are rooted in distinctively different sets of ideas about the nature of social reality. Thus, the research will contribute to better social science understanding of how and why social differences persist in daily life, and ultimately to better interventions for fostering inter-cultural communication.

The study will be carried out in Kazakhstan, where the government of Kazakhstan officially encourages repatriation. However, the return of Kazakhs from Mongolia to their historic homeland has had unexpected consequences, because state policies have not always connected well with local priorities. This situation has provoked radical new discussions of what constitutes ethnicity, belonging, and citizenship, making it an excellent opportunity for a micro-scale examination of return migration and its social and political effects.     In Kazakhstan, conceptions and practices of citizenship are illuminated through analysis of discursive constructions of kinship and hospitality, which are regarded as essential parts of Kazakh nomadic heritage. Therefore, the researcher will use the methods of both cultural and linguistic anthropology to explore conceptions of kinship and hospitality and their relation to ideas and practices of citizenship and national belonging. She will do participant observation, living with a local family and accomanying other returnees on visits back to Mongolia. She will conduct interviews with new returnees, other local residents, and officials; collect migration and life histories; and monitor and analyze media accounts.     This  research is important because return migration is found throughout the world.

Tracing the interacting effects of family, peer, neighborhood, and school influences during childhood on life success and problem behaviors in adulthood is a challenging task that is critical to understanding human development and designing interventions to treat maladaptive behavior. Individual longitudinal research projects that follow children over time usually have focused on a limited number of childhood factors that might shape later behavior. At the heart of this Collaborative is the recognition that each of the disciplines in the social and behavioral sciences has made substantial contributions to our collective understanding of human behavior and development. The evolution of our science now requires a coordinated approach to further elucidate the complexities of experience and development; thus, the current Collaborative involves sociologists, economists, education specialists, and psychologists. This Collaborative is broader in scope than previous efforts in several ways: (1) it begins with a relatively large set of established, similar, and committed longitudinal projects involving scholars from a range of behavioral science disciplines; (2) it examines the full span of life-course development, from childhood to adolescence to adulthood and across generations; (3) it examines human development in the many contexts in which it occurs, including families, the peer group, neighborhoods, schools, and communities; (4) it utilizes the most advanced statistical analysis techniques; (5) findings will have implications for understanding and creating effective interventions; and (6) there will be widespread dissemination of both the substantive and methodological knowledge. A sample of specific topics include: factors affecting children's school readiness; effects on children of parents obtaining additional educational experiences; the bidirectional effects of parenting strategies on children's behavior over time; and adulthood outcomes (e.g., educational and occupational success, substance use) of childhood and adolescent aggression. In sum, after several decades of productive yet fragmented longitudinal research in the field, this Collaborative intends to integrate and replicate findings from existing longitudinal (community-level, national, and international) studies and take many steps forward in our knowledge of developmental science.    The Collaborative fosters new methodological and statistical approaches, particularly models that examine simultaneous, multiple interacting ecological contexts, which will be disseminated through conferences, published papers, and invited talks. The Collaborative involves experts from a variety of disciplines in its meetings and activities, and encourages the participation of underrepresented undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and faculty both from the University of Michigan and from the project sites. Results will inform psychosocial interventions and social policy.  To the extent that researchers can more fully understand the influences and mechanisms that contribute to success and lack of success in life, the more likely it is that interventions can be created that will make a difference to individuals, families, schools, and neighborhoods. It is a specific focus of this Collaborative to examine social policies in different countries to understand how the well-being of children and families may differ due to the policy conditions in each country. Efforts will be made to disseminate the research findings of the Collaborative beyond academic circles to policymakers, researchers, and other important stakeholders in intervention and policy development.",Pamela Davis-Kean|Daniel Keating|L.

Over the past sixteen years, some of the most central and impassioned struggles in post-Soviet society have concerned minority languages and the publics that they mark or create. Meanwhile, there has been massive restructuring in media funding and control. To examine these struggles as they unfold in both contemporary and historical contexts, Graber will focus on the multilingual Lake Baikal region of southeastern Siberia, where generations of speakers have been slowly shifting to Russian from Buryat, an indigenous language closely related to Mongolian.     The study will consist of archival, ethnographic, and sociolinguistic research on local media production and consumption in Russia's major semi-autonomous ethnic Buryat region, the Republic of Buryatia. Graber's preliminary research has shown that some journalists attempt to moderate Buryat language shift by modeling ""proper"" Buryat, or by excising Russian words and grammar. Buryat-language newspapers are also one of the main ways in which speakers are exposed to the written language. Yet it is not clear how media discourse affects language use in the wider Buryat-speaking public.     This study will examine the relationship between linguistic decisions in Buryat-language newspapers and the everyday language of ordinary speakers. The investigator's research methods will include long-term participant observation, structured and semi-structured interviewing, sociolinguistic analysis of interactions, and formal linguistic analysis of media discourse.

The research will be carried out through an ethnographic study of several new land reform communities in southern Bahia, Brazil, where landless poor, plantation owners, environmentalists, and tourism workers vie for primacy in planning for the social and physical landscape.      To understand what kind of worlds the different social groups hope for and strive to bring about requires attention to the range of ethical and aesthetic norms, ideals, values and future orientations that influence these different groups' activities, as well as to how the groups themselves are constituted and categorized.  Therefore, the methodological orientation of this research is ethnographic, entailing long-term engagement and daily interactions with local people.  The research design also incorporates semi-structured interviews, community surveys, and an adapted version of photovoice methodology.      The results of this research will contribute to debates among academics and policy makers who are concerned with defining agrarian reform policies that will be most equitable and effective.

The research is motivated by three primary concerns: first, to understand how the experience of colonialism affects later citizenship; second, to analyze the relationship between nation, violence, and migration; and third, to investigate systematically the mutually constitutive relationships between native and immigrant populations in post-colonial contexts.    The research will be carried out in Kampala, Uganda, and will focus primarily on women. The researcher will employ multiple ethnographic research methods, particularly participant-observation and semi-structured interviews. In addition to participating in and documenting interethnic relations in daily community life, the researcher will focus intensive data collection on a sample of 30 women drawn from three different groups differentially placed in relation to Asian immigration and citizen rights. These three groups are: African feminist-activists who have represented cases of violence against Asian-Indian women; with new migrant Asian-Indian women from India; and elite Ugandan Asian women with colonial ties to Uganda. The researcher also will collect oral immigration and histories, do media analysis of newspapers and feminist literature, and collect and analyze  spatial data for urban Kampala.     The research is important because it will help to understand the factors that produce violence in diaspora communities in post-colonial settings. Because such violence is increasingly common in the world, findings will contribute not only to social science theory but also to improving social and political policies.

Sinopoli, Elizabeth Bridges will conduct archaeological survey at and analyze data from Keladi and Ikkeri, regional capitals of the Vijayanagara Empire of medieval South Asia (ca. 1330s-17th c. C.E.). These sites are located in what is today the state of Karnataka in southern India; they were occupied as sequent capitals of a regional polity which ruled under an imperial charter starting in 1499 C.E.  Bridges' research focuses on the systematic survey and documentation of archaeological remains visible on surface today.  Such finds include: temples, military fortifications, structural remains of unknown function, carved stones, pre-industrial processing areas, artifact concentrations, and water management and agricultural features.  These locations within what were larger urban and suburban contexts in the Medieval Period are documented using GPS, photos, hand drawn maps, and written descriptions.  Artifacts, such as pottery (local earthenwares and imported porcelains and glazewares), ground stone, metal objects, and coins, will be collected for analysis.    Research focusing on imperial regional capitals of the pre-modern era is important because it contributes toward our understandings of how these large, expansionist states emerged, grew, functioned, and collapsed. Many studies of imperial states have focused on core capital regions at the cost of developing perspectives on the outlying areas which underwrote the centralized prosperity for which most well-known empires are recognized.  This project contributes to the study of imperial dynamics through documenting settlements at two regional centers which operated under the central imperial authority.  Documenting the presence, location, and variability of features and artifacts that represent political, military, economic and social activities at these sites will allow comparisons between the regional settlements themselves, and between the regional settlements and the imperial capital thus allowing for examination of change over time as well as the nature of the relationship between empire and regional authorities.    Beyond contributing to social science research questions, this project will have a broader impact by enhancing the  understanding of the science of archaeology in India, through both public outreach and work within the academic community of South Asia and beyond.  In the local environs surrounding Keladi and Ikkeri, public awareness of the cultural significance of monuments as well as smaller sites has been and continues to be accomplished through face to face interaction, open meetings, and the sharing of reports and publications with village assemblies.  This project is also coordinated with the Keladi Museum and Research Bureau of Kuvempu University, Shimoga District, which curates exhibitions and assists in the sharing of research between scholars in different disciplines.  In addition to anticipated contributions to refereed journals and professional publications in North America and Europe, the author will make available results to the scientific community in South Asia. Furthermore, the author has trained and will continue to work with student and professional archaeologist volunteers in field methods of the North American scientific tradition.",Carla Sinopoli|

This project studies participation in cross-section Random-Digit Dialed (RDD) telephone surveys. The declines have led to such significant research cost increases that serious consideration of terminating basic surveys is occurring.     One large source of variation in RDD cooperation rates is the interviewer. In centralized telephone interviewing facilities interviewers are often assigned similar mixes of cases, yet obtain very different response rates. All the stimuli yielding a decision to participate in an RDD survey must be delivered through audio channel ? through words, pitch, inflection, and pacing of the interviewers? speech. These attributes are not the traditional objects of study of survey methodologists. Hence, the project combines insights from speech science, phonetics, psycholinguistics, and survey methodology. A central conceptual framework utilizes the companion notions of tailoring, convergence, and similarity in cooperative dyadic communication.     5,000 digital audio recordings of RDD telephone interviewer introductions (from two data collection organizations, 6 different surveys, and 165 different interviewers) are transformed into a quantitative data set suitable for dynamic and static statistical models of response propensities. Acoustic measures motivated by concepts from speech science are extracted using Praat acoustic software; raters make judgments of perceived attributes of speakers using both concepts central to leverage-salience theory and the social psychology; and word and disfluency rates are extracted from transcriptions of the audio files.     The resulting data set is a relational one with records at the levels of the interviewer, respondent (case), contact, and conversational turn. Hierarchical and survival models are built using the combined conceptual frameworks predicting the final participation decision of a sample case.     While the research emphasizes basic science, it has potential practical outcomes. Academic survey research is a crucial tool for a $15 billion commercial research industry in the US; this project?s success can contribute to the health of this commercial sector.",Robert Groves|Frederick Conrad

A novel methodology for dynamically controlling the execution of concurrent software in order to provably avoid deadlocks is proposed. It addresses today's dominant concurrent programming paradigm, multi-threaded programs that employ locks. In this approach, the responsibilities for deadlock avoidance are placed upon a feedback controller that is automatically synthesized from application software source code. A model of the source code will automatically be constructed from a whole-program control flow graph obtained at compile time. The feedback controller will be synthesized offline from the model using techniques from discrete control theory and used to instrument the code. At run-time, the controller will operate by carefully managing lock acquisition and release to ensure that potential deadlock states are never entered. The research plan of this proposal presents a systematic approach for the development, implementation, performance evaluation, and classroom deployment of this novel methodology. By allowing deadlock-free execution of programs via automated feedback control, the full value of unmodified legacy code will be preserved and programmers will be empowered to write code with increased safety, confidence, and productivity.",Stephane Lafortune|Scott Mahlke

A topic of practical interest to both economics and organizational studies is how individuals, when making decisions, take into consideration the impact of their actions on others, as well as social norms (such as fairness) that may apply. This project focuses on a particular question within that topic: when an authority figure attempts to exploit one of the subordinates over which he or she is an authority, when and why do other subordinates, at a cost to themselves, choose to challenge that exploitation? If they challenge the authority, is it because they think the victim of the exploitation is being treated unjustly, or because they want to reduce the likelihood of future exploitation that could target them, or is it to create (or maintain) a beneficial relationship with the victim?    This project uses experimental methods to explore this question using a stylized version of the authority/subordinates scenario drawn from previous experimental literature. Participants take on the role of either an authority or a subordinate and interact repeatedly, each round being randomly and anonymously regrouped with other anonymous participants. A novel experimental design allows the selective removal of different incentives, thereby making it possible to determine the relative strengths of the distinct (though not incompatible) motivations listed above: acting out of a social preference, acting to influence the authority's future behavior, or acting to influence the other subordinate's future behavior. This project explores behavior and motivations in a setting that has relevance to a range of political science and economic models. As well, it provides new evidence on how sophisticated reasoning about others' strategies, beliefs and learning factors into decision-making.    This study?s research on the authority/subordinates relationship has important implications for the design of political institutions, as well as other hierarchical organizations (including firms, political parties, and professional organizations). The evidence gathered regarding individuals? social preferences has practical value for those involved with distributional issues, including charities (which must understand what motivates potential donors) and designers of social welfare policies. This project also has a broad impact on participation and learning by underrepresented groups, through their experiences as subjects in the experiment. The project involves over two hundred participants, drawn from the diverse student body at the University of Michigan and from a broad range of majors including humanities and social sciences, to learn about modern research methods through direct participation, and have the opportunity to ask questions about research methods.",Tilman Borgers|Douglas Smith

The CSBYC has four major objectives: (1) to develop an infrastructure for a series of coordinated research investigations of the ecological, cultural, racial, and familial contexts that influence the development of African American children; (2) to provide training for early scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students around skills necessary to do research and practice with diverse populations of ethnic minority children in diverse community and school settings; (3) to cultivate collaborative relationships and partnerships between the University of Michigan and local communities to inform current and prospective practice and  intervention approaches for improving youth social and educational outcomes; (4) to serve as a resource and clearinghouse for scholarship, training, and practice approaches that can be utilized by scholarly and community stakeholders in the state more broadly, as well as among institutional and community settings nationally.  To meet these goals, CSBYC investigators will conduct an initial research study of middle school aged children in four diverse community settings. The goals of the research project are to study ways parents and family caregivers socialize their children around race and to examine the influence of various types of parenting on child academic and social outcomes. Using multiple methods (surveys, family diary studies, qualitative interviews, and observations), the research will show how parents choose parenting strategies based on characteristics of their communities (e.g., racial and economic diversity) along with their appraisals of the racial, cultural, and class dynamics of their communities.     The CSBYC research will contribute to understanding of normative development of African American children within their varying family, neighborhood, and school contexts, which has received relatively little systematic attention. The study of Black youth from different social class backgrounds is important for a number of reasons.  First, despite the growing Black middle class in America, a disproportionate number of studies have focused only on low-income Black children in urban settings and/or on high-risk youth populations. Consequently, race and social class often are confounded in research and in its application to practices/interventions to enhance youth development.  There is less knowledge of family, educational, and social development processes of African American children across different social class groups and the implications of community social class and demographic diversity, such as Black families' movement to, and increasing representation in, middle class or suburban settings. For instance, studies show that parental education is one of the biggest predictors of school achievement among African American youth, yet even middle class African American students trail their European American counterparts in academic achievement. Such patterns suggest that parents of different social class backgrounds differentially negotiate the schooling process for their children. It also suggests there still is much to be learned about variation in family processes within lower and higher socioeconomic levels. By examining Black families from diverse community contexts, the CSBYC investigators will address important questions about the nature of development among Black youth in ways that can support the efforts of researchers, communities, schools, and families to encourage successful development among children and adolescents.",Tabbye Chavous|Robert Sellers|Stephanie Rowley|Carla O'Connor|Robert Jagers

Using the construct of transformation of matter, which requires understanding of both discrete learning goals and also the connections between them, a hypothetical learning progression is constructed for grades 5-12.  Assessments are developed that link to the learning progression and require students to use cognitively challenging activities such as construction of models and scientific explanation to demonstrate their understanding of topics related to transformation of matter.  The resultant set of assessment items can be used to place students along the transformation of matter learning progression, regardless of curriculum.  The learning progression is empirically tested in grades 6-8 using mainly, but not exclusively, the chemistry units of the IQWST curriculum in a three year longitudinal study that measures the longitudinal progression of students and the cross-sectional development of teachers as they gain experience with the curriculum.

For example, when performing mental addition we must juggle several numbers in mind while applying operations to update those numbers.  It is well-established that there are distinct limits to the amount of information that can be held in mind at any given time and that these limits have a close relationship to our abilities to reason and to comprehend  -- in short, to our intelligence.  However, the fundamental architecture of the short-term memory system responsible for these capacity limits remains unclear.  Recent psychological research suggests that distinctions can be drawn between a single piece of information at the forefront of the mind, other information that is being held in mind, but currently not the focus of attention, and information that is not being held in mind, but available in long-term memory.  The goal of this project is to understand the brain mechanisms responsible for representing these different states of information.  With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. John Jonides and colleagues at the University of Michigan will investigate the architecture of short-term memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging.  The research will examine neural responses as human volunteers retain, retrieve, and update information in the various putative states of short-term memory.  In addition to traditional measures that afford brain localization of function, the research will employ analyses that examine functional networks of brain activation, thus elucidating brain mechanisms by which short-term memory is achieved.  The work will also examine neural responses to different types of information, such as verbal, spatial, and pictorial information and examine the brain networks involved in subserving short-term memory of each form.    Since much of human intelligence depends on capacity limits of short-term memory, understanding how the brain implements short-term memory could have substantial impact on cognition as a whole.  The understanding furthered by this research may inform methods that aim to increase short-term memory capacity and intelligence.  This research project will also provide comprehensive training functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project.  Findings from this study will be disseminated widely through publications and a seminar.",John Jonides|

Over the past decade, neuroscience has made significant progress toward understanding the neurobiological basis of schizophrenia.  Yet, popular attitudes about schizophrenia remain largely unaffected by scientific advances.  Surveys of popular opinion consistently link schizophrenia, not to brain biology, but to a host of social misperceptions.  Chief among these is the association between schizophrenia and violence.  For instance, the percentage of the population who view persons with schizophrenia as being ""dangerous or unpredictable"" more than doubled over the latter half of the twentieth century, even though research shows that, far from posing a threat to others, people diagnosed with schizophrenia have victimization rates 65 to 130 percent higher than those of the general public.      This project explores the historical disconnect between science and society regarding beliefs about schizophrenia.  It studies the surprising and often inadvertent ways in which American beliefs about the criminality of schizophrenia emerged in the 1960s- and 1970s in context of a larger set of conversations about race.  Over this vital twenty-year time period, research about aberrations in brain biology unintentionally combined with growing cultural anxieties about civil rights.  Meanwhile, reports about new ""psychochemical"" technologies of symptom control merged with concerns about the ""uncontrolled"" nature of urban unrest (unrest which was often stereotypically associated with African American communities).  As these historical contingencies evolved, the American public, and at times members of the scientific community, increasingly described schizophrenia as a violent social disease, even as biomedicine argued that schizophrenia was a disorder of biological brain function.      The three-part project highlights the complex relationships between science, medicine, and American popular culture.  Part one systematically analyzes popular beliefs about the biology of schizophrenia from the 1960s to the present.  Part two tracks changing scientific understandings about the biology and race of schizophrenia.  Finally, part three explores how popular, scientific, and medical notions of schizophrenia collided within the walls of a particular institution, the Ionia Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Ionia, Michigan.  The project's larger goal is to argue that stigmatizations of psychiatric disorders need be historically understood if these disorders are to be effectively treated in the present day.",Jonathan Metzl|

It is hypothesized that due to their unique hydrodynamic interactions ellipsoidal particles will possess a superior ability to bind the wall in medium to large blood vessels often associated with cardiovascular diseases over typically proposed spherical particles while maintaining the ability to traverse human capillaries.  The specific aims of the proposed work are: (1) to fabricate biodegradable ellipsoids from poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) polymer using the simple oil-in-water solvent evaporation fabrication method; (2) to investigate the rotational state of these biodegradable ellipsoids in physiological flow and their ability to navigate complex microvessel geometry without obstructing flow using in vitro flow assays; and (3) to evaluate their effectiveness in targeting inflamed endothelium (cell lining of the blood vessel wall) in vitro and in the presence of human blood cells.      If successful, the proposed work will significantly impact the design of injectible vascular-targeted drug carriers for highly localized and efficient delivery of therapeutics in many human diseases. The ability to target therapeutics to specific sites in the body can allow for the administration of highly potent therapeutic agents to diseased cells/tissues without affecting healthy ones; thereby, enhancing drug efficacy with no deleterious side effects. Achieving this feat can lead to a significant decrease in the high mortality rate attributed to diseases like CAD, lowered healthcare cost and improved quality of life for individuals affected with chronic inflammatory diseases.",Omolola Eniola-Adefeso|

The typical male strategy is to mate with as many females as possible while females are generally more ""choosy"" and will only mate under favorable social and environmental conditions. Possibly the most salient example of a male reproductive strategy is infanticide - when a male kills a female's unweaned offspring (sired by another male) to hasten her return to a fertile state. In turn, to protect their reproductive effort, female mammals often develop counterstrategies to infanticide such as forming defensive alliances with other individuals in their social groups, producing deceptive sexual behavior and sexual swellings to mimic the signs of fertility, spontaneously aborting a pregnancy, or prematurely weaning dependent young. Anecdotal evidence on wild geladas (Theropithecus gelada), a close relative of baboons, suggests that infanticide following male takeovers may be a threat for females with dependent offspring. However, as yet, female reproductive counterstrategies in geladas have never been examined. This project aims to investigate the function and underlying physiology of female reproductive strategies in geladas, to answer the question: does intersexual conflict exist in geladas? The first objective is to describe the normative patterns of gelada reproduction in terms of gonadal hormones, sexual swellings, and female reproductive behavior. The second objective is to investigate the functional significance behind the physiology, sexual swellings, and reproductive behavior of female geladas following male takeovers. In other words, this research will determine whether infanticide is a threat to female geladas and whether females have developed counterstrategies as a result.     This research is unique in two ways. First, it explores the potential for intersexual conflict to exist in geladas from both mechanistic and adaptive approaches. Female physiological profiles will reveal whether females perceive male takeovers as a threat and whether female sexual swellings are deceptive or not. Field observations will provide the behavioral context with which to interpret the hormonal data. Together, the hormones and behavior yield a more complete picture of what is going on. This is the first study to investigate the hormones and behavior surrounding female reproductive strategies in primates. Second, infanticide will be investigated from the female's perspective. While infanticide has been investigated in a variety of species, research has strongly focused on the costs and benefits for males. Further documentation of female reproductive strategies and counterstrategies in primate species will contribute towards a better understanding of intersexual conflict.    Data from this work will have important conservation implications.  Geladas are an endangered species and improved understanding of their reproductive behavior can help breeding efforts in captive settings.",Jacinta Beehner|Eila Roberts

Evidence from Lizard Island, Australia and the Oligocene of New Zealand    T. K.  Baumiller  Predation is generally recognized as an important agent of natural selection and the study of predator-prey interactions in the fossil record allows us to evaluate its evolutionary impact.  A large body of work has been devoted to exploring the role of predation in crinoid ecology and evolution.  For example, it has been argued that the displacement of stalked crinoids to deep water over the past ~100my (Bottjer & Jablonski 1988) was the result of increased predation pressure, especially from shell-crushing fish (Meyer & Macurda 1977; Meyer 1985; Oji 1996).  In contrast, it has been suggested that the success of the stalkless comatulid crinoids that today thrive in shallow water is due to their ability to deal with predation pressure (Meyer & Macurda 1977). The differences in handling predation pressure by stalked crinoids and comatulids have generally been attributed to the ability to shed and regenerate body parts and locomotory abilities of the latter. However, recently it has been discovered that today?s dominant group of stalked crinoids, the isocrinids, are also capable of rapid crawling (Baumiller & Messing 2007), a trait generally associated with stalkless comatulid crinoids. It also has been shown that these isocrinids are subject to predation by cidaroid sea urchins (Baumiller et al. 2008).  In response to the interaction with a cidaroid, isocrinids shed the anchored end of the stalk and crawl away from the cidaroid which is preoccupied with the shed stalk portion.  This ?lizard?s tail? strategy of escape not only links a set of behavioral traits (stalk shedding and crawling) to predation, but suggests that benthic predators, such as cidaroids, need to be considered in assessing the ecological and evolutionary history of crinoids. The major goal of this study is to confirm the robustness of a direct proxy for cidaroid predation on crinoids (bite marks and fracture patterns).  This will involve studying how living cidaroids process crinoid material with their teeth and in their gut.  This will be done experimentally at the Lizard Island Research Station (LIRS), Australia.  Also at LIRS, the processing of crinoid material by other potential predators, such as fish and crustaceans, will be explored to see whether these different predators leave unique signatures on the skeletons of their crinoid prey.  The experimental portion of the study will be followed by exploring the fossil record for historical evidence of this predator-prey interaction.  Specifically, stalked crinoids of the Kokoamu Sandstone (Oligocene; South Island, New Zealand) will be studied for evidence of cidaroid damage.  The Kokoamu Sandstone was chosen because it contains abundant crinoid columnals as well as remains of the cidaroid, Histocidaris, the very taxon which in the Recent was found with crinoid elements in its gut.  If successful, the results of this study will serve as the basis for pursuing larger goals:  (1) to explore the history of this interaction through geologic time by examining remains of crinoid stalks from localities where they are known to co-occur with cidaroid echinoids, (2) analyze the morphology of crinoids for traits associated with stalk shedding and crawling, and (3) examine diversity trends of crinoids in the context of these ?escapability? traits and the frequency of interaction.",Tomasz Baumiller|

By structure, we refer to the time-dependent shape and stress of this amazingly long and flexible biopolymer. Understanding DNA structure-function relations rests on quantifying the torsional dynamics of the molecule as torsion is implicated in all major DNA functions including compaction, transcription, replication, gene regulation, gene repair, etc. Our project addresses this need by proposing new experimental and theoretical methods for revealing the torsional dynamics of DNA at the single molecule level. In particular, we introduce a novel detection method employing a magnetic, optically modulated bead (mag-MOON) to measure the dynamic twisting of DNA molecules tethered to these beads. Simultaneously, we extend a computational rod model describing the coupled nonlinear dynamics of the tethered DNA-bead system that enables model validation from the companion single-molecule DNA experiments.    Our research on DNA torsional dynamics has broader implications for the medical and physical sciences. Consider that specific anti-cancer drugs (e.g., Topotecan) target proteins (e.g., Topoisomerase I) that relieve the build up of torsional stress and supercoils during DNA replication. By essentially blocking the torsional relaxation of DNA, these drugs inhibit the division (hence propagation) of diseased cells.  Increasing the efficacy of these chemotherapeutic drugs rests on first understanding their action on torsionally-stressed DNA. We assert that such understanding may ultimately grow from fundamental knowledge of the torsional mechanics of DNA as achieved through systematic experimental/theoretical efforts. Our experiments also introduce a novel molecular ?twist detector? in the form of a mag-MOON bead. While clearly advantageous for single-molecule DNA studies, this novel technique may translate to uses in other biomolecular systems or nano-scale devices where molecular rotation plays a major role (e.g., molecular motor proteins, molecular wheels, rotaxanes, bacterial flagella, ATP synthase, RecA).",Noel Perkins|Edgar Meyhofer

In this study, a wave centered view of structures is proposed for vibration analysis and control of complex practical built-up structures. This research consists of theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and experimental verification. Deliverables include exact closed form solutions to vibration problems in planar and three-dimensional frame structures; ?active support? and ?active joint? design strategies for absorbing incoming vibration waves or shunting unwanted vibrations to less important structural members; and guidelines for designing complex periodical frame structures from vibration attenuation viewpoint.

This will be accomplished by testing novel needle tip geometries using high speed tissue cutting test machines to characterize the mechanics of tissue cutting and by modeling the mechanics of tissue cutting.  Advanced helical needle-tips and micro-grinding methods will be applied to generate novel needle-tip geometries with sharp, burr-free cutting edges.  Two test machines, one for high speed orthogonal and oblique tissue cutting and another for high speed needle insertion, will be built to investigate the effects of cutting speed and needle tip geometry.  Mechanistic models will be built to predict the tissue cutting force related to the needle geometry and cutting speed.  Tissue fracture and tissue-needle tribological phenomena in high-speed tissue cutting will be studied to develop the fundamentals of tissue cutting mechanics.     If successful, the benefits of this research will be improved performance of the most commonly used medical device - the needle.  Tissue cutting efficiency will increase thereby reducing pain and trauma in biopsy procedures.  New biopsy machines with advanced needles and optimized operating parameters will increase the volume of tissue samples collected in each needle insertion and improve the accuracy of pathology diagnoses in a wide range of biopsy procedures.  Results of the proposed research will also extend the traditional field of machining to biomedical and health care applications and promote the emerging research frontiers in biomedical manufacturing.",Albert Shih|

AR is an emerging visualization technology which blends computer generated scenes in the form of CAD objects with the views of the real environment. From the point of view of an observer of an AR scene, incorrect visual occlusion occurs when part or whole of a real object must block the observer?s view of a virtual (i.e. CAD) object. If not resolved accurately, incorrect occlusion leads to unconvincing visual artifacts that reduce the observer?s confidence and reliability in the AR visual simulations, and consequently prevents them and other decision makers from comfortably using the simulation results for making crucial decisions. This research proposes a novel integration of geometry capture, remote sensing, and data communication technologies to enable realistic, reliable, and visually convincing results in AR animations of engineering operations. The research objective will be achieved by developing an automated method to obtain, record, and retrieve the depth information for both virtual and real entities in an AR animated scene of an engineering operation using remote sensing devices, and a z-buffering technique to detect and resolve any identified incorrect visual occlusion instances in real-time.     Success in the research will lead to significant increases in productivity, accuracy, and safety in performance of operations due to better understanding of the engineering environment in which projects take place, through the use of advanced AR visualization technology. The results will be applicable to solve a wide range of engineering problems in construction, civil engineering, manufacturing, mechanical design, medicine, shipbuilding, transportation, and other domains. Solving the occlusion problem is also necessary to enable future work on subjects such as collision detection, motion preemption, and physical interference between real and virtual objects in AR, all of which have been long standing problems that prevent the widespread application of dynamic AR in several engineering and scientific domains. This project will significantly help the career development of graduate and undergraduate students, including women and minority engineers who will actively participate in the research activities and prepare to become tomorrow?s engineers. The project will lead to new software tools and training materials that will be widely distributed to the engineering, education, research, and professional communities to enhance scientific and technological understanding.",Vineet Kamat|

Past research has approached the study of political conflicts as though they were between instrumental actors -- people and groups aiming to maximize their instrumental gains and minimize losses. Indeed, rational actor models have long dominated strategic thinking at all levels of government policy. However, many key components of decision-making vary with context, across social relations and domains, and as a function of whether or not a choice has ethical or moral entailments. The guiding hypothesis of this research is that people in political conflicts make non-instrumental judgments and decisions when they conceptualize the issues under dispute as sacred values, such as when groups of people transform land from a simple resource into a ""holy site.""  Previous research carried out by this interdisciplinary team of investigators has advanced theoretical understanding of sacred values, developed novel methods of studying their impact on political decision-making and negotiations, and demonstrated their role in non-instrumental and often violent choices in political contexts. However, scientific investigation of sacred values is still in its infancy and more needs to be done. Specifically, this research: 1) investigates biological and cultural antecedents of sacred values and the social identity functions of sacred values across cultures, 2) probes the role of sacred values in influencing violent and seemingly intractable political conflict, and 3) uses this knowledge to investigate possibilities of reducing political and cultural conflict. The methodology integrates basic and applied research, combining brain imaging studies with laboratory and field experiments, surveys and interviews in order to provide ""real-world"" relevance for policymakers as well.",Scott Atran|Gregory Berns|Jeremy Ginges

Today, efforts focus on advanced ""cyberinfrastructure"": using networked computers, databases, and organizations to bridge divides among diverse scientific disciplines.  Cyberinfrastructure divides into three main activities. First, large numbers of automatic sensors monitor subjects of interest, such as ecosystems and Earth's climate, producing massive volumes of digitized data.  Second, in many fields computer models have replaced laboratory experiments as the principal means of data collection, prediction, and decision-making.  Third, increasingly vast data resources (scientific memory) are now available, but are often distributed across thousands of research sites and institutions, in numerous incompatible formats.  For cyberinfrastructure-enabled science to deliver on its transformative potential, cyberinfrastructure designers need better ways of understanding how scientists actually create and share data in practice, and how they use it to create new knowledge.  To investigate data practices empirically, this project examines four large cyberinfrastructure efforts: the Long Term Ecological Research Network, the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, the WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network, and the Earth System Modeling Framework.  In each case, the investigators will study how cyberinfrastructure is used in monitoring, modeling, and memory.  These projects spread across many disciplines addressing three important domains, all related to climate change concerns: ecology and environment; hydrology and water management; and earth system science.  In conducting the project, the investigators will develop innovative methods of distributed ethnography, collaborative history, and multimodal network analysis.  In addition to published findings, the project will produce a 'best practices' handbook meant to guide data practices and coordination in cyberinfrastructure.  The project will partner with organizations working to enhance the role of women in computing; to build database systems for American Indian communities; and to engage other groups often ignored in information infrastructure development.  The project will thus lay groundwork for an inclusive, theoretically rich, and practically engaged social science of cyberinfrastructure.",Paul Edwards|Thomas Finholt|Steven Jackson|David Ribes

Food webs are paradigmatic of complex natural networks. Formed by species and their feeding relationships, they underlie the flow of energy through ecosystems and their responses to human-induced and environmental perturbations, including species' extinctions. Several simple models of food web structure exist, but these do not accurately represent the complexities present in real networks. The goals of this project are to develop new theory to extend simple models of food web structure, investigate biological mechanisms underlying this structure, examine the modularity of food webs, and consider networks quantitatively by incorporating interaction strengths among components. In particular, the researchers will address the effects of species extinctions on food web robustness and examine how stability at the level of an entire network results from instability of individual components. The resulting theory will provide a general framework to advance our understanding of food webs and diverse other complex biological networks.      The proposed research will contribute directly to education and outreach programs for grade school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. These activities will be coordinated through ongoing programs at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis' 'Kids Do Ecology' program and through the University of Michigan. Web-based teaching modules and classroom presentations will introduce grade school students to ecology, complex systems, and mathematics by teaching them about many different types of biological networks.

Given Brazil?s myth of racial democracy, a society where Brazilians of mixed racial origins co-existed in peace, Brazil was considered a racial utopia when compared to the US, a country where legally sanctioned racism oppressed non-whites for centuries. However, Brazil's racial democracy is now considered outdated, as many racial disparities have been documented in various studies.  Due to a history of more socially accepted racial-mixing and the popularity of the racial democracy ideology, racial classification and race-based group identities have been difficult to ascertain. The elusiveness of Brazilian racial classification creates special challenges for Brazilians who immigrate to the US, where, by contrast, distinct racial groups are the social reality. While some research has shed light on the racializing experiences of certain Latino immigrant groups in the US, few studies have investigated how Brazilian immigrants interpret race in the US.  Through conducting in-depth interviews with Brazilian immigrants who have returned to Brazil (return migrants), this project examines how Brazilian immigrant experiences in the US influence how they think about race while in the US and upon returning to Brazil. This project is being conducted in Governador Valadares, Brazil's largest immigrant-sending city to the US; 15 percent of the city's population is estimated to be living in the US. Unlike other immigrant-sending cities in Latin America, Valadares is unique since many of its inhabitants (Valadarenses) do return and live in the city after the US migration. To properly examine how US migration influences return migrants' racial conceptions, a comparison group of Valadarenses who never migrated (a sibling or cousin of each return migrant) will be included in the study. The co-investigator will conduct in-depth interviews with fifty return migrants and fifty non-migrants (men and women between ages 25 and 50.), which explore:1) self-perceived racial classification; 2) defining race in Brazil and/or the US, and 3) experiences of racism in Brazil and/or the US.  The co-PI will use Brazilian and US Census data to provide demographic information about Valadares and the US Brazilian immigrant population.     The broader impacts resulting from this project are: (1) a stronger knowledge of how race is a social construction that changes over time and from place to place, (2) how race in the US may influence immigrants' racial/ethnic identity choices, and (3) understanding how race in the US is changing as a result of immigrant incorporation. Furthermore, this project will help sociological researchers better understand the intricacies of racial classification, racial/ethnic identity formation, and the effects of transnational migration on racial conceptions for an understudied immigrant group in the US. These are very important themes to explore given recent debates on immigration reform and the assimilation of current immigrants into US society.",Sarah Burgard|Tiffany Joseph

O'Shea and a team of colleagues will conduct an initial field season to investigate ancient archaeological sites located beneath Lake Huron.  The team brings together students and faculty from Anthropology, Naval Engineering and Computer Science in a collaborative effort to investigate camps, settlement and caribou ambush sites that have been submerged and protected by the waters of Lake Huron.  With the retreat of the continental ice sheets, the early Great Lakes experienced a series of rapid rises and drops of water level.  Roughly ten thousand years ago, the lakes reached an extremely low level, perhaps 100 meters lower than modern lake levels, which is termed the Lake Stanley Phase.  At that time, the basin of modern Lake Huron held two lakes, separated by a large ridge of land running northwest to southeast across the basin.  The causeway was some ten miles wide and presented a mix of sandy shorelines, rocky outcrops and open stands of spruce.  Given its orientation it seems likely that it would have provided an important route for the annual migrations of the caribou herds, and natural ambush points for early hunters.  With the further withdrawal of the continental ice sheets and changes in lake outlets, this unique landscape disappeared beneath the waters of Lake Huron, preserving the traces of the early hunters.  The survey will employ a novel layered strategy to locate ancient sites.  This search strategy includes sophisticated environmental modeling, acoustic survey with side scan sonar, acoustic and visual survey using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), site inspection and sampling using remote operated vehicles (ROVs) and the potential direct examination of sites by archaeologists trained in the use of SCUBA.   The Lake Stanley survey will provide important new information at both theoretical and substantive levels.  The intellectual merit of the research is the potential for recovering intact sites from a time period that is very poorly known on land in the Great Lakes region.  It will be the first time that submerged occupation sites of Lake Stanley age have been found in the deep waters of the Great Lakes and will allow an entire range of current models for Late Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic settlement and subsistence practices to be tested.  The broader impacts of the study are that it will result in the creation of simulation models of early communities and the ancient landscape that will provide an important tool for both research and public education, and will test the utility of a search approach that may be broadly applicable to underwater archaeological searches in many parts of the world.  Additionally, the research will almost certainly result in the discovery of shipwrecks, aircraft and other items of historic importance lost in the depths of Lake Huron.  Finally, the research program will foster the collaborative interaction of computer scientists, naval engineers and archaeologists as they adapt existing capabilities, equipment and approaches to a novel research problem.  These interdisciplinary benefits will be spread among faculty, graduate students and undergraduates in all three programs.",John O'Shea|

When designed appropriately, such robots, both as individuals and as groups, exhibit complex and seemingly ?intelligent? behaviors, solving challenging tasks in real time, while reacting only to their local environment and obeying sets of local rules. In part, this approach to robotics was inspired by considering natural systems, such as self-organization and adaptability of social insects in their colonies. An analogous approach to initiate the development of the field of behavior-based molecular robotics will be performed over the next three years, leading to groups of molecules that would appear to an observer to show a variety of task-oriented behaviors or some form of purposeful and dynamic self-organization.     Individual behavior-based molecular robots are single molecules displaying multiple sensors-actuators. When exposed to artificial landscapes displaying substrates keyed to their sensors-actuators, the molecules start executing elementary steps, determined, in a stochastic sense, by their constantly changing local environments. On some landscapes, called prescriptive, individual molecular robots and their collectives will execute algorithms mimicking wound-up automata with sequence control mechanisms. In contrast, on non-deterministic landscapes, the robots and their collectives will demonstrate properties emerging from internal organization of individual sensors and actuators and through local interactions between molecules and their environments. Importantly, these new interpretations of molecular behaviors will allow radically different experiments from all previous approaches to molecular robotics, while keeping experimental designs realistic, leading to embodiment in the physical world.",Nils Walter|

Neuhoff (P.I.)  This research project is focused on the development of efficient new methods for sampling and  processing multidimensional data such as images, video, or spatially distributed sensor data,  especially the first and last. Traditional methods of digital image processing rely on the taking  and processing of regularly spaced samples (pixels), typically at the sites of a lattice, for example  a square grid of points. In contrast, this project is investigating digital image processing  based on samples taken in a cutset, the simplest example of which is a square grid of lines that  spans the image. More generally a cutset is defined in terms of a set of neighborhood relations  among a discrete set of potential sample sites. Cutset sampling is expected to be especially  effective when the capturing of image edge information is important.  The principle motivations for cutset sampling derive from the facts that two-dimensional data  can often be well modeled by Markov random fields and that unsampled pixels of Markov  random fields can be efficiently estimated with belief propagation algorithms. This research  project is investigating different forms of cutset sampling, and it is developing reconstruction  algorithms tailored to cutset sampling, image compression methods based on cutsets, distributed  sensor network algorithms for scenarios in which sensors are deployed on cutsets, and analysis  techniques to determine the strengths and weakness of cutset sampling, and to enable comparisons  with conventional lattice-based sampling.",David Neuhoff|

However, because of the increasing complexity of systems and data, as well as the increasing sophistication of adversaries, traditional methods of anomaly detection are no longer sufficient. These methods assume that anomalies look substantially different from normal measurements, or that their characteristics remain constant over time. In many practical applications of interest, however, anomalies are only distinguished by subtle spatio-temporal characteristics. For example, a network security event may involve a sequence of traffic patterns, each of which is innocuous in its own right, but which occupy a localized or lower-dimensional spatial domain when viewed together. Alternatively, anomalies may exhibit temporal structure caused by a slow but steady drift from normal to abnormal behavior. This project develops new theoretical and algorithmic approaches to detecting such spatio-temporal anomalies. The research will impact the monitoring of a wide range of critical infrastructures and application domains, including environmental systems, health care networks, power grids, and communication networks.    The project focuses on spatio-temporal anomalies that (1) have significant spatial overlap with the nominal distribution, (2) are distributed on a manifold of lower dimension than nominal measurements, and (3) have time-varying distributional characteristics. The research applies and extends techniques from statistical machine learning, including transductive, manifold-adaptive, and online learning, to the anomaly detection setting.   This framework allows the investigators to address several difficult and long-standing challenges such as optimal tracking of drifting anomaly distributions and efficient relaxations of combinatorial graph-based inference algorithms.",Clayton Scott|Alfred Hero

Davis's excavations are (1) the first designed to identify houses and community buildings for the early village period and (2) the first to collect data on the activities carried out within them.      One goal of this project is to determine whether the ancient villagers of Yuthu were self-sufficient to meet their subsistence and non-subsistence needs at the level of the household, the village, or multi-village network.  Villagers may have considered themselves to be part of a network of settlements that was not necessarily the same group who provisioned their everyday activities.  Indeed, based on studies of early villagers elsewhere, one comes to expect that the perceptions of membership and the actual practices that define the limits of a human community are fluid and may even vary independently of one another at times.     In the Andes today various economic networks integrate settlements spanning many ecological zones.  In addition, a set of beliefs ties individuals and families to a sacred landscape that extends well beyond the limits of their village.  These enduring concepts structure the lives of people today and this project will allow one to determine whether similar beliefs shaped the lives of people in the past.  This project will compare the use of non-local items in domestic contexts to items used in ceremonial contexts at Yuthu, one village in a multi-village network, in order to understand how archaeologists can define community at two levels: (1) the actual reliance on distant places to provision daily activities and (2) the role of distant places in the conception of community membership that is reinforced in periodic rituals of integration.  Results will show whether or not the perceived and practical limits of a community, evident in the material remains of ceremonial and domestic practices, co-varied as villages lost autonomy and became part of a regional polity for the first time.      In addition to helping archaeologists and other social scientists understand community organization in high-altitude environments throughout the world, this project will train Peruvian and U.S. students in archaeology.  The project results will be made available to the scientific community through scholarly journal articles in English and Spanish, conference presentations, and the Ph.D. thesis of Allison R. Davis.  Results will be presented to the local community of Collana-Cruzpata-Chequerec in site reports and oral presentations made in their town meetings.",Joyce Marcus|Allison Davis

The program is motivated by the increasing penetration of commercial applications in the space industry. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of new methods and standards for terrestrial testing of space craft. By standardizing testing techniques, new designs can be more readily benchmarked and failure rates can be predicted with less time in testing. By improving standards for measuring ground test facility capability and consistency of measurement, industry will be better able to judge the merits of tested designs and accept them with greater confidence.      The proposed center in collaboration with two universities and endorsed by several government agencies and industries, if successful, will facilitate the research development to support the US satellite communication and aerospace industries. This research will help maintain U.S. strategic competitiveness in space power and propulsion.

The objective of this research is to develop compact and efficient radiation sources for active interrogation of objects in order to detect nuclear materials.  The approach will be to use radiation sources generated by high power laser produced particle beams.  The intellectual merit of the project stems from the novel approach to particle beam generation involving the use of the large electrostatic fields generated by intense laser pulses within plasmas, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than those found in conventional accelerators.  These fields are ideal for accelerating electron bunches to high energies over very short distances. In the proposed work, the 300 Terawatt laser facility at the University of Michigan will be used to generate Giga-electronvolt-range energy electron beams which will then be used to generate a high flux of highly directional gamma rays to be used for simultaneous radiography and active interrogation (gamma ray activation) of material. The production of very energetic proton beams from underdense targets will also be investigated which may allow more efficient production of pions and muons.  This proposed research may lead to broader impacts since such beams will be of benefit for a wide range of research which presently relies on accelerator technology including biology, materials science and medicine.

By 2011, yearly data center energy consumption in the United States is projected to grow to over 100 billion kWh at cost of $7.4 billion. As much as 40% of this energy is consumed by DRAM and disks.   Portable consumer devices, where battery life has long been a key concern, instead use faster and more energy-efficient Flash storage. Flash is non-volatile, has near-zero standby power draw, and each Flash read requires 30x less power than a DRAM read and three orders-of-magnitude less power than a disk access. Moreover, Flash provides far lower access latency and higher bandwidth than disks, approaching DRAM performance levels.  Enterprise storage vendors have recently announced products that replace traditional disks with high-capacity Flash solid-state disks (SSDs). However, because they are accessed through interfaces optimized for legacy rotating disks, SSDs fail to fully-exploit the low latency and high bandwidth Flash can provide. Furthermore, replacing conventional disks with SSDs does not address the growing power consumption of severs'   DRAM. In this project, we examine further opportunities, beyond SSDs, to save energy with Flash in enterprise systems by integrating Flash throughout the servers' storage and memory hierarchies.  The long term goal of our research--to improve data center energy efficiency--has the potential to drastically reduce the carbon footprint of data centers and the need for additional power generation capacity.",Thomas Wenisch|Trevor Mudge

To improve the efficiency of these workloads and systems, designers and developers need tools to identify the bottlenecks, so that they can address them.  However, existing performance analysis tools, such as software profilers, cannot account for hardware bottlenecks or for situations where software overheads are hidden due to overlap with other operations.    As computer systems become ever more complex networked aggregations of software and hardware from multiple vendors, the ability to isolate and address inefficiencies that reduce throughput and waste energy is daunting.  The goal of the project is to address this problem by developing an analysis methodology and tool set that identifies true bottlenecks in complex systems spanning multiple software and hardware layers executing concurrently across multiple CPU cores and dedicated hardware devices.  This research utilizes critical-path analysis to not only identify bottlenecks but also quantify their contribution and estimate the speedup obtainable if a particular set of bottlenecks is removed or reduced.  Ultimately, this research will lead to qualitative performance improvements in software and hardware system designs as the methodology and tools produced aid designers and developers in focusing their efforts on removing the true bottlenecks.

The goal of this research is to formulate a fundamental system science for interdependent, dynamically coupled civil infrastructures via multi-role intermediaries (MRIs), with the objective of improving their collective performance for resiliency and sustainability.  This project examines the flow of resources and commodities between infrastructures via devices and junctions referred to as MRIs. Examples of MRIs include building energy systems that couple the built environment with electricity infrastructures, GPS-enabled mobile phones that couple transportation and telecommunications infrastructures to manage traffic congestion, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that couple transportation and electricity infrastructures by using grid electricity for transportation, possibly sending stored electricity to the grid (vehicle to grid, or V2G) when appropriate.  This project will formulate a framework to design and control MRIs whose functions are influenced by stochastic processes, interactions across space and time scales, and human decision-making.  The research includes the following tasks:  (1) combine agent-based modeling and life cycle assessment into a framework for evaluating the long-term sustainability of dynamically coupled infrastructures; (2) develop hybrid state diffusion approximation methods to model the dynamics of resiliency in coupled infrastructures with stochastically available resources and MRIs; (3) create a fundamental hierarchical (multi-scale) framework for optimizing the design and configuration of MRIs for resiliency and sustainability within each infrastructure; (4) use stochastic dynamic programming and Poincar? map techniques to optimally control intermediaries in light of their stochastic dynamic switching between different infrastructures; (5) construct Lyapunov energy functions for MRI-coupled systems to control for stability and resiliency; and (6) develop statistical, energy-based model reduction techniques to reduce complexity in infrastructure and intermediary models to facilitate analysis and design of coupled infrastructures. The research outcomes will provide fundamental theoretical contributions to engineering disciplines that are rooted in dynamics and controls, as well as to the social sciences and the field of industrial ecology.  The research will use plug-in hybridization and V2G integration as the test bed application.  With respect to PHEVs, the research will (1) quantify their impact on sustainability and resiliency of the transportation and electricity generation infrastructures, (2) design and configure PHEV powertrains that balance conflicting needs of the transportation and electricity generation infrastructures, (3) formulate power and energy management strategies in PHEVs, taking into account their transportation role, their role in providing distributed storage to the electrical grid, and the switching between such roles, and (4) investigate grid power and energy management methods that capitalize on the distributed capacity provided by V2G integration and the resulting ability to accommodate renewable resource intermittency and prevent and recover from catastrophic failures. The framework developed in this research will enable practical and efficient identification of infrastructure configurations that are globally sustainable and resilient.  The research team includes investigators from the University of Michigan and the Missouri University of Science and Technology in the fields of electrical and mechanical engineering, economics and public policy, natural resources and environment, and transportation research.  The methods and tools will be disseminated to industry via an external advisory and technical publications.

This project, through implementation and use of a cybertool, DAPLDS, that enables adaptive multi-scale modeling in a global computing environment (i.e., distributed, heterogeneous computing environment using ""volunteer"" PC computers), will further knowledge of the atomic details of protein-ligand interactions and, by doing so, will accelerate the discovery of novel pharmaceuticals. The goals of the project are: (1) to explore the multi-scale nature of algorithmic adaptations in protein-ligand docking and (2) to develop cyber infrastructures based on computational methods and models that efficiently accommodate these adaptations.    The intellectual merit of the project derives from small molecules, called ligands, which play an essential role in turning protein functions on or off, or in providing substrates for chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. Knowledge of the atomic level details of the protein-ligand docking is a valuable resource in the development of novel pharmaceuticals. The docking process depends on the characteristics of the protein-ligand complex involved and given a certain complex, the characterization and modeling of the docking process can affect both solution accuracy and model execution time. Based on characteristics of the protein-ligand conformations and the availability and reliability of computational resources, DAPLDS adapts, when appropriate, the model and/or the computational system to optimize model accuracy and time to solution. The multi-scale modeling adaptation in DAPLDS comprises at least three spanning scales: (1) protein-ligand representation spanning scale from rigid to flexible representation of protein-ligand interactions, (2) solvent representation spanning scale from less accurate to more accurate modeling of solvent treatment, and (3) sampling strategy spanning scale from fixed to adaptive sampling of the protein-ligand docking space.    Broader Impact: DAPLDS applies multi-scale modeling to the search for putative drugs and drug leads. Our project changes the way in which grand challenges are approached by implementing an adaptive cybertool that scales beyond the protein-ligand docking application, e.g., this tool can be adapted and used for protein folding and protein structure prediction.

The project will build on ongoing preliminary work toward a first-generation polarizable force field for proteins; focusing predominately on deriving relevant parameters for lipids and membrane bilayer components, and a series of monovalent ions. This will involve application of a combination of quantum mechanical and classical simulations (MD of pure bulk liquids) to determine the electrostatic and non-bonded parameters defining the CHARMM-FQ potential. Following modification of force constants of intramolecular potentials, the force field will be validated via application to simulations of lipid bilayers as membrane models. Finally, umbrella-sampling methods will be employed to compute a potential of mean force for a series of monovalent ions translocating through the Gramicidin A channel.    There is significant potential for broad impact on the general scientific community of biophysicists, and more specifically on those modeling membrane systems such as ion channels and transporters. The rigorous development and application of polarizable force fields for to large biomacromolecular systems is a necessary step in advancing understanding of these systems. Furthermore, for ion channels there is a vast amount of information to be gleaned from simulations using polarizable force fields, since the physics of such systems is critically dependent on a precise balance between interactions that will be provided by polarizable interaction potentials. This research also provides educational and training opportunities for postdoctoral scholars and graduate students. Due to the broad spectrum of methodologies (ranging from ab initio/DFT methods to continuum based macroscopic methods such as Brownian Dynamics and electro-diffusion theory) required to address the various aspects of force field development and application to ion channels, there is tremendous scope for learning; equally important, the integration of techniques will allow a broad understanding of the interconnections of available technologies in solving scientifically oriented problems, in this case within the realm of biophysics. Finally, all of the code development and force field parameters associated with the CHARMMFQ force field will be available to academic laboratories via distribution of the CHARMM academic license and from our web site (for the force field parameters).",Charles Brooks|

The approach is to improve charge separation and transport in such devices by creating ordered nanoscale interface between an electron donor and acceptor layer in a conjugated polymer based solar cell.      Intellectual Merit:  Since the discovery organic photovoltaic made with bulk heterojunction polymer blend in 1995 that resulted in the relatively high efficiency, major efforts in the past many years have been developing various annealing methods to modify the heterojunction morphology as a means to improve the efficiency. It becomes evident that these approaches based on the self-organization of blend materials are reaching its limit, and a new methodology is needed to realize the theoretical efficiency for the organic photovoltaic. The most promising one is to ""artificially"" create the ordered nanoscale interface between the donor and acceptor layers. This program exploits a top-down nanofabrication technology that can not only produce ordered nanoscale morphology with tunable properties, but also scalable to high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing in the future.

Therefore the success of this program has transformative impact on the critical fields of renewal energy, sustainable environment and the society. Both graduate and undergraduate students (including minority student) will be involved in the research. The results will be incorporated into courses offered in the EECS and MSE departments",Lingjie Guo|Jinsang Kim

The objective of this three-year cross-disciplinary team effort is to build and operate a tiny, so-called CubeSat, spacecraft carrying a UHF radar receiver payload.  Launch of the satellite will be as a secondary on a Department of Defense launch scheduled for December 2009.  The satellite will be operated in coordination with the AMISR incoherent scatter radar from the ground to investigate the radio aurora from field-aligned irregularities in the high-latitude ionosphere.  The primary scientific objective of the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAE) mission is to understand the microphysics of plasma instabilities that lead to field-aligned irregularities (FAI) of electron density in the polar lower (80-300 km) ionosphere.  The RAE mission is specifically designed to remotely measure, with extremely high angular resolution (~0.5 degree), the wave spectrum of ~1 m scale FAI as a function of altitude, in particular measuring the magnetic field alignment of the irregularities.  Due to the magnetic field geometry at high latitudes this bi-static (ground radar to satellite) configuration, in which a narrow radar beam is scattered off the FAI and then observed by the CubeSat receiver, is the only way to perform these measurements.   Better understanding of ionospheric irregularities and their role in ionospheric dynamics is an important space weather research objective because plasma structures in the ionosphere can have an adverse effect on communications via satellite, HF and VHF radio and as well as an adverse effect on navigation, tracking, and positioning.  The project has a very strong educational component; it relies on extensive undergraduate and graduate student involvement through all aspects of the mission.  The new, largely unproven technology involved in cubesat missions, inherently makes the project associated with significant risks.  On the other hand, however, the project has tremendous potential to be transformational not only within its own research area but also for the larger field of space science and atmospheric research as well as within aerospace engineering and education.",James Cutler|

Entry into new work settings is already challenging enough when newcomers are physically co-located with coworkers, but joining such a virtual research organization may prove even more difficult. This multi-method project studies the socialization processes newcomers face when joining existing virtual research organizations (e.g., collaboratories). Specifically, this study focuses on Post-Doctoral Fellows as newcomers joining either distributed or co-located research teams. Survey, comparative case study, and agent-based modeling methods will be employed to better understand how Post-Doctoral Fellows transition into their new positions and how such transitions can be improved. The objectives of the project are (1) to better understand under what general conditions Post-Doctoral Fellows are successful and (2) to identify social and technical barriers for Post-Doctoral Fellows entering virtual organizations. Understanding the practices that lead to Post-Doctoral Fellow success under co-located as compared to distributed conditions will improve virtual organizations by providing benefits to both the researcher and the research program. The long-term goal of this study is to identify, formalize, and gain insights into the smart practices of virtual organizations planning for and engaging newcomers.

The nanoHUB was created as a new form of science gateway, intended to enable collaboration for learning and discovery in nanoscience and technology. The nanoHUB is only four years old but has grown to more than 60,000 members from 170 countries. The goal of this project is to understand the degree to which nanoHUB generates new intellectual capital; the technical and social features of the nanoHUB that support knowledge generation; and, the conditions needed to improve design choices for the expansion and creation of science gateways. The project will compare processes and outcomes in nanoHUB with Indiana CTSI, one of several new gateways that have been launched in other domains using the suite of software and tools available in nanoHUB. IndianaCTSI supports clinical and translational research to improve human health.     In the past it was assumed that virtual spaces like nanoHUB and IndianaCTSI could not be considered sites of situated practice or generative of knowledge on their own terms, and no midrange theory of collaborative practice in virtual organizations exists. One aim of this study will be to contribute to the development of a conceptual framework to fill this theoretical gap. In doing so, the project draws on literature in the areas of socio-technical systems, knowledge generation, and collaboration. The research will be conducted in a series of three phases: 1) interviews and focus groups; 2) surveys; and 3) social network analysis.

Traditional tools to support VOs (e.g., electronic mail) enable communication and coordination at a distance and across institutional barriers. In such cases, the organizational work of forming and sustaining VOs focuses on the use of these tools to foster trust and to negotiate equitable and efficient resource utilization. More recently, research in computer science has sought to delegate such organizational work to a new class of VO tools, collectively termed ?Grid? technologies.  Grid technologies are envisioned to provide new modes of collaboration, improved allocation of scarce resources, and novel pathways for discovery and innovation. While past research has successfully addressed questions of long-distance communication and coordination involving traditional tools, much less is known about how new tools may transform VOs. Open questions include: the consequences of delegating trust, access and resource distribution to Grid-based systems; the challenges of sustaining computationally-supported VOs; and the new kinds of organizational roles and responsibilities necessary for the upkeep and maintenance of VOs.      This project undertakes a comparative study of VO formation and maintenance in two leading collaborative science networks: the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).  Both LTER and OSG are mature enterprises for supporting multidisciplinary scientific research; however, they differ in the nature of their VO tool use.  Whereas LTER uses a broad variety of conventional tools to augment organizational communication (exhibiting the communicational paradigm, or a 'weakly technically delegated' VO), OSG delegates key components of organizational life and maintenance to Grid-based mechanisms (i.e., a ?strongly technically delegated VO, exemplifying the computational paradigm). Using ethnographic and comparative methods, and drawing on theories from science and technology studies (STS), organization science, and human-computer interaction, this study will compare the different approaches taken by LTER and OSG to: i) provide a better and more sophisticated mapping of the characteristics of individuals, groups and organizations that embrace VOs; and ii) develop rigorous comparative models for the differential human and technical work which sustain VOs.",David Ribes|Thomas Finholt|Steven Jackson

Formulating contest problems is not straightforward because the contest does not have pre-requisites. Because students are not expected to know linguistics, specific languages, advanced math, or computer programming, the problems must be self-contained, and yet must still test the skills such as algorithmic thinking, abstractly representing a solution space, reducing a solution space, and evaluating a solution. These skills represent computational thinking, the part of computer science that does not involve computers. Some problems also introduce tools of linguistics and language technologies such as finite state machines and context free grammars. So more generally, this Small Grant for Exploratory research tackles the new problem of designing a curriculum of training sessions and contest problems that introduce high school students to computational thinking as it applies to the processng of human languages. The importance of the project is to inspire students to study linguistics and computer science and to increase participation and diversity in those fields.",Dragomir Radev|

The research is intended to provide basic information that can lead to reliable bioassays to determine the effect of a wastewater plant discharge EON on the receiving surface water and contribution to eutrophication. An excellent background on known factors that affect the availability of organic nitrogen in surface waters was presented and reflected the diverse backgrounds of this collaborative research group; environmental engineer, biological oceanographer, organic geochemists, and chemical oceanographer. Basic hypothesis for the research is that the bioavailability of EON is related to salinity concentration and light and that the biota in the surface water may be different at different salinity locations and possibly have different EON conversion and uptake characteristics. The research would investigate the effect of different seed sources on the EON bioavailability. The proposal provides a plan to assess the biological populations, the level of algae growth by. Chlorophyll ? measurement, the availability of the EON based on molecular weight size, and application of chemistry methods to assess the elemental composition of the EON and molecular characterization. The ability to develop a bioassay for the bioavailability of EON and to determine what amount from wastewater plant effluents is biodegradable will have far reaching impacts. First it would provide water quality managers and modelers scientific basis on whether to treat all effluent nitrogen as bioavailable as they now do or to account for a possible recalcitrant fraction that has not affect on eutrophication activity and thus does not contribute to developing hypoxia conditions that are harmful to fish. The bioassay tool can help guide wastewater plant designs as effluents from different operations can be used to determine if different design or operating conditions affect the EON bioavailability. Other important impacts are a summer mini school that can use this project and water quality issues in the Chesapeake Bay area as local and real scenario for study by the public. The work will be showcase and model for interdisciplinary research on a large scale problem. This type of training and education will have a long term impact on the graduate students working on the project.

Coping with these changes therefore requires local action in an internationally coordinated way that acknowledges inequities in impacts regionally and locally.  Awareness is growing of the need for a portfolio of mitigation options that local regions can use to develop effective strategies for reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, to increase the efficiency of energy use, and to store consumed carbon and make energy production sustainable.  Furthermore, organizations, communities, and regions need to identify opportunities to reduce their vulnerability to climate-change impacts and increase their capacity to adapt their land-use and livelihood strategies to the changing climate.  In this context, land resources like the biosphere, soils, and water and their interaction with people and the climate system play an increasingly important role.  Although limited in its areal extent, land resources are an important component of the global carbon cycle, and they can be used to produce renewable energy and to sequester carbon.  This potential, however, is constrained by existing demands on land resources to provide for human settlement, food and fiber production, and other ecosystem services like maintenance of water quality.  To address these topics and bring together the complementary expertise of U.S. and German scientists, this award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a binational conference on the challenges of understanding and managing land-use dynamics under a changing climate.  The conference is to be held in Berlin, Germany, in early October 2008.  The conference will bring together 35 scholars from United States with about 100 from Germany to discuss the current state of the art in land-change science as it relates to climate change, to identify priorities for research, to provide opportunities for participation of young scholars, and to develop new collaborations between U.S. and Germany-based scientists.    This project will help facilitate greater scientific understanding of the complex interactions among people and land resources in the face of climatic change.  It will facilitate international collaboration between U.S. and German scholars.  Because roughly half of the U.S. participants will be at early stages in their professional careers, the long-term potential for future international collaborative findings is especially great.  The project also will advance understanding of the complex dynamics between land resources and climate change, thereby fostering more effective strategies for mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change in a range of different terrestrial environments.",Daniel Brown|

The workshop will be held at the Interdisciplinary Microelectronics Center (IMEC) in Leuven, Belgium on September 25-26, 2008.  The workshop will bring together leading researchers from the microsystem and nanobiotechnology communities to identify grand challenges, promote collaborations, and recommend research needed to speed the use of these technologies in biology and biomedicine.   This workshop will bring together scientists and engineers from micr/nano communities and biology and biomedicine and will try to identify devices and systems that could be used for in-vivo and in-vitro applications.  The two disciplines seem destined to meet at cellular dimensions, and this workshop seeks to bridge the gap between them.    Intellectual Merit:  After nearly four decades, many of the microelectronic technologies needed for health care are now emerging. Sophisticated signal processing tasks involving millions of transistors can be performed on a single chip at microwatt levels.  Wireless technology has created global communication networks and is being reduced to single chips capable of working in-vivo.  MEMS-based sensors now exist for many physiological parameters, and hermetic wafer-level packaging techniques suitable for use in implants are emerging. Structures based on nanotechnology are being combined with microfluidics and being developed to analyze DNA and screen for proteomic biomarkers of Alzheimer?s disease, heart disease, and cancer. But many challenges remain.  Improved power sources are needed, some perhaps based on energy scavenging, and the critical interface between the biological environment and physical monitoring devices must be much better understood. True advances in health care will likely require the integration of both.     Broader impact:  Health care is one of the most important problems confronting the 21st century.  In 2000, life expectancies ranged from 35 years in Sierra Leone to 77 in the U.S. and 83 in Japan, and in U.S. the cost of health care represented 13% of GDP. About 630 million people worldwide were over the age of 60, but by 2050 this number will increase to over two billion, an increase of 330%. Clearly something must be done to avoid catastrophic health care cost.  Diagnostic devices based on cellular/molecular analysis and implantable microsystems for treating many of our most serious chronic disorders are among the most promising approaches for meeting these challenges.",Kensall Wise|

Workshop participants, recognizing the growing importance of research on the interplay of humans and technology, or socio-technical systems, proposed the CSST as a mechanism for promoting and supporting important research on social aspects of technological change. An identified high priority, even in advance of the formal creation of CSST, was initiation of an annual series of summer research institutes targeted at people entering the field of sociotechnical systems research.

Participants from a broad range of disciplines, including engineering, architecture, industrial design, visual arts, psychology, and business, among others, will be invited to attend.     Design is an integrative activity that spans many disciplines; however, our educational system often struggles to provide interdisciplinary design experiences for our undergraduate and graduate students and to recognize the significance of design research. Recently, new and innovative interdisciplinary graduate programs in design have arisen with strong ties to engineering yet structured to fully embrace and complement research from other disciplines. These graduate programs have the potential to influence the development of a new discipline of design that includes both education and research. Interdisciplinary education is a central factor in expanding and sustaining an American competitive advantage in today's global economy. Developing design as a broadly recognized and practiced instructional discipline is essential for maintaining leadership in the innovation of new products and systems. This series of workshops will bring together experts in the field of engineering design research and education and the larger design community to explore the challenges, successes, practices and future directions of interdisciplinary design graduate programs to gain insight into how to construct, grow, and sustain programs that prepare students for successful design innovation.

The efforts are to develop (a) methodology in using tunable piezoelectric circuits and the associated new algorithms for multiple-FRF based damage identification; (b) novel eigenstructure assignment technique for the further enhancement of performance; and (c) innovative power electronics to create sensory nodes that have integrated self-sensing actuation, parameter tuning, and energy harvesting functions for realizing the proposed damage detection methodology.  This research is expected to increase the sensory system sensitivity, robustness, and accuracy; and will eventually deliver a system that is easy to implement, accurate in prediction, self-contained, and wireless-ready.  The aerospace, civil, mechanical, transportation, and many other industries would benefit from the damage detection devices and technologies developed based on the outcomes of this investigation.  The proposed educational efforts will have broad impact on student learning through integrating research and education at Penn State and University of Connecticut.

IMRT is considered to be the most effective radiation therapy for many forms of cancer. Current approaches decompose the treatment planning problem into several stages and the corresponding subproblems are solved sequentially. Although this may lead to inferior treatment plans, the lack of suitable model formulations that allow for efficient solution methods has so far prevented the integration of the subproblems. In particular, the subproblem that has received the most attention is the central problem of determining an intensity profile or fluence map for each of the beams used in irradiating a cancer patient. However, issues pertaining to treatment-delivery efficiency and quality are known to have a significant impact on IMRT treatments. Models that fully take into account both potential and limitations of the treatment equipment as well as changes in the patient anatomy over the course of the treatment will be developed along with algorithms to solve the resulting integrated problems. All of the developed models and algorithms will be tested on actual clinical patient data.    Every year, hundreds of thousands of patients receive cancer treatment by radiation therapy. This project will provide highly effective and robust integrated models for IMRT treatment-planning problems that integrate clinical considerations that are currently not yet addressed satisfactorily. The development of efficient approaches to solve the resulting integrated optimization problems in realistic computational times will provide real-time decision support to physicians and clinicians and will help them to find treatment plans that do not require a choice between a good chance for a cure or control of disease and the potential quality of life.",Hilbrand Romeijn|

Such time series implicitly contain valuable information about the connectivity and regulatory structure of the underlying genetic or biochemical network mechanism. The extraction of this information is a challenging task because it requires the development of new mathematical and computational methods of nonlinear estimation that involve iterative search algorithms. Priming these algorithms with high-quality initial guesses can great accelerate the search process.    Even when full genomic sequences for an organism are available, the functions and  interactions of only a small number of gene components are clear. Presently, the functions of uncharacterized proteins have usually been inferred on the basis of sequence similarities, common structural motifs, gene order, gene fusion events, or similarities in gene expression. The proposal goal is to develop a new method for functional predictions based on the role of the gene in networks. This method allow us to perform functional predictions for proteins independent of homologies in structure or sequence, and provide a way to characterize proteins that have not yet been studied using published biological data from high-throughput technologies.    The methodology will be applicable to any organism, including humans, where  only three to five percent of gene function is known. As we better understand the functions of genes and proteins in a network context, we can better predict and control their responses to internal and external perturbations. For the foreseeable future, the type of modeling predictions will likely be one of the many inputs into the decision making process in the pharmaceutical industry, and biomedical sciences. The research will provide interdisciplinary (biological, mathematical and computational; experimental and theoretical) training to undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and help produce a generation of scientists comfortable both with biology, mathematics and computation.",Santiago Schnell|

Workshop, held on May 10-11, 2007 in  Arlington, Virginia. The proposed workshop will develop curricular templates, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, based on the recommendations from the previous report, for various types of schools (e.g., large public, large private, small public, small private). It is anticipated  that these templates will facilitate the adoption of the 5XME recommendations by a wide cross section of mechanical engineering departments across the country.    A diverse group of mechanical engineering educators will be brought together in the workshop to ensure that all points of view and learning styles are fully considered. These workshop participants will represent leaders (e.g., department heads, program advisors) from a variety of schools (i.e., small, large, public, private) to reduce the barriers to implementation of curricular reforms in mechanical engineering departments across the country",A.

The PI will study the combinatorial group theoretic and cohomological properties of well-known and important, but poorly understood subgroups such as those of the Johnson filtration, or ""higher"" Torelli groups, of Mod(S) and Out(F). One component of this project investigates questions related to spines of spaces which can be used to study cohomology and find presentations for these groups. Concerning the dynamical aspects of Out(S), the PI expects to develop a method for constructing fully irreducible outer automorphisms which are in some sense customized. This technology is already well-developed for Mod(S), but relies heavily on metric properties of Teichmueller Space and the complex of curves. Analogues of these objects for Out(F) are very recent and not yet well-understood, and it is one of the PI's long term goals to probe their geometry via the dynamics of the constructed automorphisms.      The mapping class group is important to many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and low-dimensional topology, and it also plays an important role in recent developments in theoretical physics. A successful program for studying the mapping class group Mod(S) and its relative, the automorphism group Out(F) of a free group, is based on their relationship to linear groups, i.e., groups consisting of matrices. Linear groups have been very well studied and appear everywhere in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Because matrices are relatively easy to understand, it is productive when studying a particular group to understand how closely it resembles a linear group. The PI is involved in developing the theory for Mod(S) and Out(F) by understanding possible obstructions to their being linear groups, as well as understanding the extent to which they behave and can be considered like linear groups. The goal of the project is to study these groups and particular elements therein via their algebraic, topological, geometric, and dynamical properties.",Alexandra Pettet|

The ERC is targeted at the intersection of micropower electronics, wireless communications, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  The resulting devices are expected to become pervasive in society during the next two decades, with applications ranging from environmental monitoring (weather, global warming, air and water quality) to improved health care (wearable and implantable biomedical systems).  The ERC brings together faculty from the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Michigan Technology University, with expertise in VLSI design and computer architecture, wireless communications, packaging, medicine, and MEMS.  The Center is supported by the State of Michigan and over twenty companies having vital interest in these areas.  The four research thrusts of the ERC focus on micropower circuits, wireless interfaces, sensors and microinstruments, and micropackaging.  The work will extend existing micropower circuit techniques and sensor-driven controller architectures, develop single-chip communication transceivers based on micromechanical structures and MEMS microesonators, explore a variety of self-testing microinstruments (including chemical, mechanical, and thermal devices), and develop hermetic wafer-level packaging using deposited thin films and fused vacuum cavities.  The goal is to develop systems that are rapidly configurable, reconfigurable, and self-testing.  Work in these four thrust areas will be coordinated by focusing on two application testbed systems:  an rf-powered implantable microsystem (initially a cochlear prosthesis for the profoundly deaf, with subsequent extension to devices for treating epilepsy and Parkinson's disease), and a battery-powered environmental monitoring system capable of gas analysis as well as the measurement of barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, and other variables.  These testbeds are intended to emphasize the challenges that will be found in microsystems generally.  Industrial programs, including technology transfer and jobs creation, are important components of the ERC and will be addressed through joint efforts, personnel exchanges, and prototype fabrication.	The multidisciplinary nature of microsystems makes them ideal tools for exploring innovative approaches to engineering education, including electives that cut across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The ability to mix students with different backgrounds in team-oriented research is critical in the training of future engineers.  The educational thrusts in this ERC extend from high school through the graduate level.	In high school, working with science coordinators and teachers, MEMS will be used to illustrate important principles and encourage students to pursue exciting careers in engineering.	This will include special efforts with underrepresented minority students.  In the undergraduate and graduate programs, multi-university multidisciplinary distance learning and virtual-laboratory experiences will be employed in the development of new course sequences in MEMS and microsystems.  Finally, the ERC will explore the broader societal implications of these microsystems and their associated technology.  This award provides $2.5 million for the first year of NSF support to the ERC through a fice-year cooperative agreement, which is renewable in year three and six.",Kensall Wise|Khalil Najafi
