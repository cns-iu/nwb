This requires information about the properties of Grid resources such as hosts, network switches, links and paths, software libraries and systems, user and organization rights, software services, event channels and dictionaries, and more.  The information needed for an application to run, the values of the information (how fast the information changes) and the freshness of the information (how fast updates must be pushed to the application) can vary dramatically. These attributes place significant demands on the resource information service, demands that are arising with increasing prevalence in the general area of directory services as well. The Grid Forum, an international standards body for world-wide Grid computing, is developing standards for representing and querying this information. There is much that is excellent about these evolving standards, but there are many forms of highly desirable queries that will be difficult or expensive to perform in these systems. In particular, dynamic information will require very high update rates not supported by LDAP-based implementations.    This project will address these concerns through a proposed (and tentatively named) Grid Resource Information Service (GRIS), a unified relational approach to grid information services. The research will start with the full ACID (Atomicity/Consistency/Isolation/Durability) functionality of a relational database system and \"build down\" to a practical resource information system that still provides most of the benefits of the RDBMS.  Such a system will provide a single highly flexible query model and language for all types of Grid resource information, no matter how dynamic.  The research will culminate in an extensible implementation based on commodity database systems and the SQL language, including \"canned queries\" for non-SQL users. The project will evaluate the new system and techniques using logged updates and queries from an existing Grid information service, and comparing results with a hierarchical system such as Globus MDS2. To facilitate comparisons, the project will produce a set of benchmark queries from discussions with users, tool developers, and Grid Forum members, and will quantify the limits of these queries."

Indiana University - Bloomington  	  RI: A Research Infrastructure for Collaborative, High-Performance Grid Applications    This project, developing an experimental infrastructure for distributed high performance computing, supports ten research projects extending the location-transparency that the Grid provides for computation resources to the full spectrum of activities which end-users require. Services being explored include software development, parallel code middleware, distributed software components for scientific computing, security for parallel remote method invocation,   managing large-scale data streams, and collaboration methodologies. The research builds on and extends the institutions collaborations with several national Grid research teams. In contrast to existing national and university infrastructure available through production machines, this research requires an environment tolerant of experimental network protocols, temporary middleware, and other system-level changes. The infrastructure will contribute to the following research projects:  a. Opie:  basic work on parallel matrix algorithms that achieve high efficiency across many architectural platforms  b. LAM: middleware MPI implementations supporting hierarchical and fault-tolerant parallel computing  c. dQUOB: application of SQL queries to live data streams  d. RMI Security: basic research into security mechanisms for remote method invocation, allowing security to be traded off with efficiency  e. HPJ: High Performance Java creating a language platform for portable high performance coding  f. Grid Broker: reliable, robust publish/subscribe service for introducing fault tolerance into the distributed Grid environment  g. Community Grids Collaboratory: advanced collaboration capabilities with applications to both distance education and distributed communities  h. Xports: design of methodologies for remote instrument access and data management of the resulting extremely large data sets  i. Software Components: distributed software component model designed for applications that use parallel computing \"nodes\" in wide-area Grid environments  j. Science Portals: set of tools that allow programmers to build Grid distributed applications accessed and controlled from desktop environments and web browsers  Major improvements to infrastructure supporting all these projects include a 16-node cycle server and a large-scale file server as well as network upgrades to and within the building."

This approach separates portal control and basic services from content.  A central control server provides basic portal services such as authentication, access control, and user customizability.  Into this framework, portal content and custom services are plugged in using software components called portlets.  The container manages the organization and interaction of the portlets, and the portlets deliver specific web content (either local or remote), including Grid service interfaces.    The portlet-based design concept supports distributed, loosely coupled development and deployment: user interfaces and science interface components can be developed independently, using the standard portlet API, and then reused between portals. Services and interfaces may be installed and added to various portals in a well-defined way.  The portlet model is also an ideal fit to the emerging Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) and its implementation specification, the Open Grid Service Infrastructure (OGSI). Because OGSI is based on the new web-service standards, each Grid service can be directly accessed by a custom portlet.       The impact of making the Grid readily approachable by the international community of researchers is potentially extremely large, as the immense resources that have been collected and organized in recent years by the underlying Grid technologies become visible as usable components of the global research community's desktop.  This project will greatly simplify the use of Grid technologies and allow new services to be made readily available to individual researchers and groups by enabling the proliferation of Grid portal technology through reusability and simplification of installation.  Scientists will be able to easily form flexible groups with collaborators across the world and use the Grid to share data and resources.  This project provides tools for collaboration between established and ad hoc groups of users, enabling those scientists to communicate effectively with each other about the science they are doing, and providing customized views of the Grid that are tailored to meet the needs of collaborating groups."

Their mitigation is stifled by rigid information technology frameworks that cannot accommodate the unique real time, on-demand, and dynamically-adaptive needs of weather research.    Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD), the foundation of which is a series of interconnected virtual \"Grid environments,\" allows scientists and students to access, prepare, predict, manage, analyze, and visualize a broad array of meteorological information independent of format and physical location.  A transforming element of LEAD is the ability for analysis tools, forecast models, and data repositories to function as dynamically adaptive, on-demand systems that can change configuration rapidly and automatically in response to the evolving weather; respond immediately to user decisions based upon the weather problem at hand; and steer remote observing systems to optimize data collection and forecast/warning quality.     LEAD will allow researchers, educators, and students to run atmospheric models and other tools in much more realistic, real time settings than is now possible, hasten the transition of research results to operations, and bring the pedagogical benefits of sophisticated atmospheric science tools into high school classrooms for the first time.  Its capabilities will be integrated into dozens of universities and operational research centers that collectively reach 21,000 university students, 1800 faculty, and hundreds of operational practitioners."

The Data Capacitor, a 250 Terabyte short term data store with very fast I/O and the Metadata/Web Services server, a robust server, enable the institution and collaborators to adopt and depend upon the Web services for exchange of research data. Research and development efforts at IU will create the tools required for the Data Capacitor to be used to its fullest. Progress and research possibilities in many disciplines have been fundamentally changed by the abundance of data now so rapidly produced by advanced digital instruments. Scientists face the present challenge of drawing out from these data the information and meaning contained within. IU has established a significant cyberinfrastructure composed of high performance computing systems, archival storage systems, and advanced visualization systems spanning two main campuses in Indianapolis and Bloomington, and connected to national and international networks. This institution enhances its infrastructure in ways that will result in qualitative changes in the research capabilities and discovery opportunities of a broad array of scientist that work with large data sets. The Data Capacitor is expected to become a development platform and testbed for new cyberinfrastructure, as well as a proof of concept for large capacity, short-term storage devices. On the other hand, the Metadata/Web Services server enables the institution to establish a leadership position in standards-based data dissemination in many fields.    Broader Impact: The Data Capacitor enhances current practice in relevant scientific communities, enables technology transfer and commercialization, develops a 21st century workforce, and ensures public understanding of the value of science. Deliberate use of objective metrics in all areas of broader impact ensures that new discoveries, technology development, educational activities, and public information efforts translate into benefit for the scientific community and society as a whole. Women and underrepresented groups will be drawn into computing-intensive sciences and applications of computing."

These computations can often be viewed as complex data flow graphs having components that are both data- and computationally- intensive, and requiring access to live data feeds and access to large-scale computational resources. A user may cycle through multiple graphs accessing data from sensors, instruments, databases, and large collections of files in the process of discovering new knowledge. This research investigates a programming model and framework for knowledge discovery in data-driven applications. Users program the system by declarative specification of detect-analyze-response behavior. Underlying the programming model is a continuous rule-based events processor and workflow orchestration engine organized as Web services. The research formalizes an abstract model of interaction and will map the higher-level conceptualization to the events processing and workflow runtime components. It demonstrates that the model supports a unique adaptive framework where knowledge gained from the computational and data analysis can be fed back to the data event streams. The approach is validated experimentally through quantifiable metrics and by its application to two model problems: severe storm prediction where a weather forecast is triggered based on data mining results from mining radar or model data, and adaptive resource management where hardware and software resources and environment data streams are monitored for on-the-fly resource requirements  prediction."

The first outcome of this work is a provenance collection and experience reuse tool that makes minimal assumptions about the software environment and imposes minimal burden on the application writer. It stores and produces results in a form suitable for publication to a digital library.  The provenance collection system is a standalone system that imposes a minimal burden on users to integrate it into their application framework and it exhibits good performance.     A second outcome of the work is a recommender system for workflow completion that employs case-based reasoning to provenance collections in order to make suggestions to users about future workflow-driven investigations. The workflow completion tool builds on computer models of case-based reasoning to develop a support system that leverages the collective experience of the users of the provenance system to provide suggestions. As a key part of effectively evaluating aspects of the tool, this work builds a gigabyte benchmark database of real and synthetic provenance information.  Real workflows are sought from the community, with synthetic extensions to the data set for completeness for purposes of testing.
