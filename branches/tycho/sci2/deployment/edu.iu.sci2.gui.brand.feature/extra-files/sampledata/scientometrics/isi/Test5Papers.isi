AB The study of networks is gaining prominence in many disciplines as well
   as in the popular press. Information scientists, however, have studied
   networks for decades. This session will explore the potential of using
   citation network analysis and social network analysis to provide
   structural assessments of scientific communication. Panelists will
   discuss their research and highlight the advantages and challenges of
   using these methods to derive a comprehensive portrait of the diffusion
   of scientific knowledge.

AB The empirical question addressed in this contribution is: How does the
   relative frequency at which authors in a research field cite
   'authoritative' documents in the reference lists in their papers vary
   with the number of references such papers contain?

AB To better understand the topic of this colloquium, we have created a
   series of databases related to knowledge domains (dynamic systems
   [small world/Milgram], information visualization [Tufte], co-citation
   [Small], bibliographic coupling [Kessler], and scientometrics
   [Scientometrics]).

AB WoS export files are created in which all cited references
   for source documents are captured. These bibliographic collections are
   processed by HistCite, which generates chronological tables as well as
   historiographs that highlight the most-cited works in and outside the
   collection.
