0121481,ITR/SY+SI:The System Architecture of a Computing Utility,CNS,ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS,"October 1, 2001","December 17,  2008","Lam, Monica",CA,Stanford University,Continuing grant,Sajal Das,"December 31,  2009",2911212,Mendel          Rosenblum               |Dan             Boneh                   |,lam@cs.stanford.edu,340 Panama Street,STANFORD,CA,94305,6507232300,CSE,1687,HPCC|9218|1687|1656,0206000    Telecommunications                      |,0121481,"Computing services in the future should become just as available and easy to use as any of the modern  utilities: power, water, or telephone service. A compute utility should work reliably and invisibly,  providing users with simple, efficient access to their data and individualized computing environments  anywhere in the world. Data kept in the utility may be private, publicly available, or shared between  designated parties.       Our proposed compute utility architecture is based on the idea of a compute capsule, which captures  the entire logical state of an active computing environment. A capsule is portable, persistent,  host-independent, self-contained and can be suspended on disk, arbitrarily bound to different machines,  and transparently resumed. Compute servers in a utility run a small trusted computing base, which  manages the compute capsules like a cache. Users' capsules can be run on any of the compute servers in  the utility and are typically run on local machines for enhanced interactive performance. Capsules provide  users with customizabililty as well as a guarantee of isolation from other users. As persistent objects that  can be shared, duplicated and version-controlled, capsules can be easily managed and administered.       The compute utility model has significant advantages over our current environment. First, instead of  requiring end users to procure, administer and upgrade their equipment individually, resources of a utility  are shared and managed centrally by experts, thus resulting in a more efficient system. Second, a global  utility allows users efficient access to their computing environment everywhere. They need not juggle a  large number of different interfaces and deal with the discontinuities as they move between home and work  every day. Third, a professionally managed compute utility designed to support global mobility and  sharing can provide greater security than our current environment. In contrast, today novice users are  responsible for keeping their systems secure, and the lack of adequate support for sharing and mobility  leads to practices that jeopardize security. Fourth, the infrastructure of a utility serves as an excellent  platform for several emerging computing trends: software hosted remotely by application service  providers, support of ubiquitous access devices, and large-scale distributed computing.       The goal of this research project is to investigate the viability of a compute utility and to lay the  technical foundation for such an infrastructure. The techniques developed can also be applied to manage an  institution's distributed resources.       First, we will investigate the concept of capsules fully by studying their design and applications.  Capsules can be implemented at the machine, operating system and application level; trade-offs between  these different approaches will be studied. We will also explore novel uses of capsules: capsules can be  used to run untrusted software; they can provide secure and shared environments for group projects;  capsules can also serve as pre-installed software packages ready to run on any machine. We will develop  the associated tools to make capsuleseasy to use.       Second, we will develop the technologies to ensure security in a compute utility. Security will be  provided at three levels: a small trusted kernel that provides isolation between capsules and monitors  capsules for added security; the use of certified capsules to create trusted computing environments; data  security will be provided by encryption, and sharing will be supported by a flexible key management  scheme. We plan to conduct a careful analysis of the vulnerabilities of the system.      Third, this research will produce the technologies useful for creating scalable, efficient, and easily  maintainable compute utilities. They include techniques for managing machines in a globally distributed  environment by treating them as caches of capsules, and techniques that combine capsule caching and  remote display technology to support global mobility and sharing.      This research will develop a prototype compute utility to validate the technology developed. To make  extensive experimentation possible, the prototype will support legacy software. The experiments will be  designed especially to address the information technology needs of universities.      Computer systems have gone through two major eras, time-sharing on mainframes and personal  computing. The success of this research may usher in a new era of compute utility and have a significant  impact on our future computing practice."

Givental, H. Hofer and the     author of this proposal. SFT is a large project which lies  on the     borderline between Symplectic Geometry, Hamiltonian Dynamics,     Enumerative Algebraic Geometry, Low-dimensional Topology, Theory of     Integrable Systems in Mathematics, as well as String Theory and     Mirror Symmetry in Theoretical Physics. Among the goals of the theory:    - definition of new, SFT-based invariants of symplectic and contact       manifolds and their Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds;    - applications  to the  Low-dimensional topology;    - development of  new tools for proving enumerative  results about       periodic orbits of   Hamiltonian systems;    - understanding of the appearance  of integrable hierarchies in       Gromov-Witten theory.       Symplectic Field Theory has already proved to have  important                      applications. In particular, the ideas of the SFT were    instrumental in the solution of several old outstanding questions    in Symplectic Geometry and Hamiltonian Dynamics. There is a hope     that some current research in the SFT may bring some breakthrough     in the low-dimensional topology. Further development of the theory     should also bring new applications not only inside Mathematics, but      possibly in some areas of Theoretical Physics, including String     Theory and Mirror Symmetry. Besides developing new applications the     work under this project will also concentrate on building the     rigorous foundations of the SFT."

How do you incent people to contribute personal information and recommendations in recommender systems and discretionary databases? While this project is motivated by its potential application to electronic commerce, the focus is on foundational matters. Computing in the Internet era means computing in the context of multiple  self-interested entities, which in turn means that reasoning about computing must take the incentives of these entities into account. This, in turn, calls for a fundamental integration of ideas from computer science (such as fault tolerance, fairness, verification, algorithms, complexity, graphical models of uncertainty, machine learning) with elements of game theory (such as mechanism design, equilibrium analysis, game representations, learning, and agency theory). The outcome is expected to benefit electronic commerce, but also more fundamentally to help lay the foundations for a new area of research called \"non-cooperative computing.\""

Many of life's basic functions, from protein folding and ligand binding at the micro level, to meiosis and mitosis at the cellular level, to the beating of a heart at the macro level, are best described as shape deformations in time. Flexible materials are finding increasing applications in engineering, across areas such as testing and manufacturing, and especially in biomedical applications, including prosthetic devices and minimally invasive imaging and surgical procedures. Special effects in the entertainment industry and haptics-based human-computer interfaces also require better models for flexible objects. Though deformation in nature can be based on a variety of underlying physical processes, we believe that there are a number of unifying principles common to understanding all deformations. Today, however, we lack a general computational theory of how to sense, represent, simulate, approximate, actuate, control, and render deformable objects.    Research Goals and Methods  The goal of this proposal is to undertake a foundational study of representations and algorithms for the computational modeling of deformable objects. Such modeling is challenging because deformations involve representations of shape and motion, and bring together continuous and discrete phenomena, as well as local and global constraints. Some of the specific challenges that have to be addressed are:  1.	the behavior of deformable objects is defined by both geometry and physics and characterized by complex high-dimensional energy landscapes that need to be compactly encoded and efficiently interrogated for actuation, control, and planning;  2.	physically accurate simulation of deformations is of-ten computationally expensive; we must find ways to approximate the full physics, while still guaranteeing the correctness, or at least appropriateness, of the solution that we compute in the parts of the system we care about;  3.	discrete events, such as collisions and self-collisions, alter the continuous evolution law of the system; these events must be efficiently predicted or detected, and processed;  4.	contact and self-contact must be modeled across rapid changes in the contact manifold, including its dimensionality (e.g., cloth draping over a rigid object);  5.	deformations are often associated with changes in the shape topology (e.g., the surgeon's scalpel cutting the patient's skin tissue); such topology modifications must be smoothly accommodated in our models.  Towards this goal we have put together a team of PIs and consultants/advisors that combines expertise in scientific computing and physical simulation, geometric modeling and computation, motion planning and control, local and distributed sensing and actuation, model parameter estimation, as well as extensive experience in the computational modeling of specific deformable objects, from molecules to textiles, and in applications from medicine to entertainment"

The Center is entitled  \"Center on Polymer Interfaces and Macromolecular Assemblies\".   The MRSEC is a partnership between Stanford University, UC Davis, UC Berkeley and the IBM Almaden Research Laboratory.    The research is organized into three interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs).   Synthesis and Application of Nanostructured Materials (IRG 1) has as its mission to develop new methods to prepare functional macromolecules followed by self- and directed assembly of these molecules into nanoscopic structures.  Potential applications are in nanotemplating, photovoltaic devices and novel catalytic systems.  The techniques and materials developed in IRG1 have direct applications for single molecule studies in IRG 2 and polymer bilayer assemblies in IRG 3. Structure and Dynamics of Confined Systems (IRG 2) is concerned with the effect of confinement due to interfaces, entanglements, branching etc, on the structure and dynamics of molecules and macromolecular assemblies.     IRG 3 on Functional Biomolecular Membranes investigates the fabrication of the interfaces between lipid membrane-countering surfaces and biological systems and the study of the dynamical properties of these interfaces.  The ultimate goal of the IRG is to develop interfaces between hard and soft (functional) surfaces.    The Center support undergraduate summer research activities in academic and industrial settings as well as in science museum projects.   Plans are to increase the participation of physically disabled students.  The REU activities will be extended to UC Berkeley and to the Institute of Polymers in Dresden, Germany.  The K-12 programs for teachers and students includes partnerships with area schools in collaboration with the East Palo Alto Unified School District.  New activities are planned together with the San Francisco Exploratorium and its Teacher Institute.      The Center operates shared facilities at Stanford and UC Davis.  These are accessible by CPIMA members as well as non-members.  In addition, CPIMA members have access to a wide range of facilities at the IMB Almaden Research Center.

A single operating system error can crash the machine.  A single  security hole can compromise the integrity of the entire system or, as  software and its errors is replicated, the integrity of entire networks.  This research focuses on practical techniques to effectively find large  numbers of such software errors.  Initial results are promising: the  approach has found hundreds of security holes and thousands of serious  errors in the Linux operating system, as well as in large commercial  systems.    The research centers on using static analysis to find errors in source  code. It uses two main techniques: (1) metacompilation (MC) to check  correctness rules (such as ``a call to the lock() function must be paired  with a call to unlock()'') and (2) belief analysis to infer such rules  automatically.    Metacompilation uses programmer-written, system-specific static checkers  to find software bugs.  Because these extensions can be written by  system implementors themselves, they can take into account the ad hoc  (sometimes bizarre) semantics of a system.  Because they are compiler  based, they also get the benefits of automatic static analysis.    Belief analysis: A major obstacle to finding program errors in a real  system is knowing what correctness rules the system must obey. These  rules are often undocumented or specified in an ad hoc manner.  Belief analysis automatically infers such checking information from  the source code itself, rather than the programmer, thereby avoiding  the need for a priori knowledge of system rules.  It works by analyzing  source code to infer what programmers believe to be true and checking  these beliefs for contradictions.  For example, if a call to ``lock()''  is paired with a call to ``unlock()'' 1000 times and not paired once,  this is a good indication that the code believes these calls must be  paired, and that the single deviation is an error.    The research will also involve an educational component.  The most  significant feature will be heavily involving undergraduates in research.  Empirically, doing so helps them think creatively, independently, as  well as pushing them to go much deeper than a typical class."

In recent years, non-numerical data and parameters have emerged. The object of this project is to provide ways of averaging, building confidence regions, running Monte Carlo algorithms, doing regression and testing models for rooted binary trees. Currently biologists validate their phylogenetic trees by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the columns of DNA sequences and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to the branches of a consensus tree. This reduces the problem to a collection of binomial parameters, losing much of the multivariate information. A more geometrical procedure based on confidence regions in tree space is preferable and overcomes the multiple testing problem. The projects extends both Bayesian and frequentist inferential procedures for binary trees to a nonparametric context using a complete geometric construction of the relevant tree space. The mathematical tools include probability theory, topology and algebraic combinatorics. Collaboration with Louis Billera and Karen Vogtmann (Cornell Mathematics Dept.) has enhanced our mathematical understanding of tree space. The space of trees has negative curvature, thus we know we can define geodesics on this space as well as convex hulls. Many of the actual distance computations can have exponential complexity, good approximation algorithms are important for the applications considered. This work helps think about the statistics of biological networks as generalizations or mixtures of trees.  	A new type of data has appeared in genetics and molecular biology, these data are not real numbers or vectors, but trees, family trees or phylogenetic trees relating different species and hierarchical clustering trees relating different genes according to their differing expression patterns. This project provides programs for visualizing and doing statistics on these new data, we will provide the biologists with open source computer packages that they can use to analyze their own data. For instance, classical linear regression is based on projections; in the same way if we want to compare two sets of trees, we will use distances and methods for projecting in tree space. The project includes two workshops, one for mathematicians in the first stage, to publicize some of the harder open problems, and another in the last year to teach biologists how to use the geometrical tools developed in matlab or R in practical examples.

The project aims to develop new synthetic approaches and characterization techniques for the preparation and study of well-defined smart materials.  Living free radical polymerization techniques are developed as a platform for the synthesis of polymers with controlled structure and architecture that respond to two different stimuli: temperature and pH.  Structural features, such as the separation of the responsive units via the formation of block copolymers, and the nature of the chain architectures (linear, grafted, stars, and networks) are explored in detail.  Furthermore, the reversible temperature- or pH-driven formation of supramolecular structures in solution from the linear, grafted, and star architectures are studied.  A more fundamental challenge is to understand the relationships among structure, property, and function for these stimuli-responsive materials.  Based on this understanding, the controlled release of drugs and other small molecules from gels, stars, polymer-drug complexes, or supramolecular structures (e.g. polymeric micelles) is examined.      A vigorous and interdisciplinary teaching and outreach program is a critical feature of this project and significantly extends the collaborative relationships built on these scientific foundations.  Educational and teaching expertise in polymer chemistry and materials research that has been developed in CPIMA is transferred to both ITT and BAJA, while the exposure of undergraduates, graduates, and post-doctoral scholars to research at all three institutions establishes a unique collaborative environment.

Localized deformation typically is followed by a reduction in the overall strength, and thus can have a significant impact on material and structural behavior.  Because shear bands are quite often observed in soils, it is of considerable interest and importance to the geotechnical community to be able to capture the full effects of strain localization in predictive models for analysis and design.  Of key relevance are the ability to predict when a shear band forms, how this narrow zone of discontinuity is oriented within the material, and how the propagation of the shear band influences the post-localization constitutive response.  Currently, even the most advanced and well-calibrated numerical models cannot predict the onset of localization, as the mechanisms governing localized deformation still are not properly understood.    The development of more accurate mathematical models of soil behavior thus requires a more fundamental understanding of the localization phenomena; in particular, the important factors responsible for the inception and development of localized deformation.  The objective of this research is to combine state-of-the-art geotechnical experimental techniques with advanced finite element modeling to obtain a more thorough understanding of the strain localization process in sands.  A meso-scale modeling approach will be used, which will treat specimen response as a structural response and will incorporate the measured spatial density variation and other imperfections (natural and imposed) to analyze the specimen response as a boundary-value problem.  Experimentally, the technique of X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT), widely used in medical applications, will be used to capture meso-scale density variations in plane strain specimens of sand.  Digital Image processing techniques will aid in transferring of the CT results as input into the finite element models.  Finally, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) will be used to track local, in-plane displacements throughout deformation.  The modeling will consider effects of both strong and weak imperfections, both imposed and naturally occurring. By capturing all of these imperfections, the potential of existing strain localization models for application to practical boundary-value problems can, finally, truly be assessed.    This NSF award will enable identification of important factors that contribute to the initiation of strain localization in sands, yielding tremendous insight as to why persistent shear bands form where they form in granular materials in general.  That the Geomechanics and Geotechnical Systems Division of NSF contributed to sponsoring the 6th International Workshop on Bifurcations and Instabilities in Geomechanics (IWBI) in 2002 highlights the need for engineering input in this active research area.  Recognition of the fundamental deficiencies of the standard FE method and development of techniques to circumvent these difficulties have immense implications to how geotechnical engineers analyze boundary-value problems in practice, particularly in the regime of instability and softening.  Furthermore, the use of advanced scanning and data imaging techniques available in other fields, such as those used in medical and materials sciences, will put the field of geotechnical engineering at parity with current technology.  The proposed partnership between numerical and experimental research will ignite a more thorough approach to investigating the localization phenomenon.    The second PI is a recent member of the faculty at JHU, and the proposed research will help her to develop a strong research group in advanced geotechnical experimentation that can provide mentoring to women and minorities.  Currently the first PI supports two underrepresented graduate students (Black and Hispanic) while the second PI supports two undergraduates, one of whom is a woman, in her research group.  Both schools have been very conducive to departmental support of undergraduate involvement in research, and to support of underrepresented students.    Through research exchange programs with local high schools, the laboratory and simulation components of the proposed research will serve as ideal avenues to engage high school students in geotechnical engineering and the research process in general. The union of numerical and experimental research will offer Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University graduate students a more multifaceted approach to graduate education."

This project is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, multi-modal  project that looks comprehensively at sensitive data in a networked  world.  There are two main academic centers of activity (Yale and  Stanford), three smaller-scale academic participants (Stevens  Institute of Technology, NYU, and the University of New Mexico), and  substantial participation by non-academic partners, including  technology companies, (IBM, HP, and Microsoft), representatives of  user communities (Citigroup, NIH, Yale Center for Medical Informatics,  the Census Bureau, and the Secret Service), and DC-based policy  organizations (The Center for Democracy and Technology and The  Electronic Privacy Information Center).    A major technical theme of the project is privacy-preserving data  mining, and, more generally, techniques for meeting the potentially  conflicting goals of respecting individual rights and allowing law  enforcement and other legitimate organizations to collect and mine  massive data sets.  Other technical agenda items include (1)  accessibility and reliability of distributed data (2) operating on  encrypted databases, (3) remote control of data, (4) repelling hostile  data, and (5) auditability of data-management systems.  Because these  technical goals are affected by lack of agreement about the meanings  of basic terms, most notably \"privacy,\" a major goal of the project is  the development of a conceptual framework for the study of rights,  responsibilities, and public policies focused on sensitive-data  handling.  This part of the project incorporates the notion of  \"contextual integrity,\" which considers both the context and the  content of data sets in assessing sensitivity.

These two groups, through their involvement in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, sulfur and nutrient elements, may have played important roles in the climate variations of the late Quaternary, and they also may be key players in future environmental change. A current paradigm is that irradiance and iron availability drive phytoplankton dynamics in the Southern Ocean. Recent work, however, suggests that carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations may also be important in structuring algal assemblages, due to species-specific differences in the physiology. This proposal examines the interactive effects of iron, light and CO2 on the physiology, ecology and relative dominance of Phaeocystis and diatoms in the Southern Ocean. The Ross Sea is an ideal system in which to investigate the environmental factors that regulate the distribution and production of these two algal groups, since it is characterized by seasonal blooms of both P. Antarctica and diatoms that are typically separated in both space and time. This study will take the form of an interdisciplinary investigation that includes a field survey and statistical analysis of algal assemblage composition, iron, mixed layer depth, and CO2 levels in the southern Ross Sea, coupled with shipboard experiments to examine the response of diatom and P. Antarctica assemblages to high and low levels of iron, light and CO2 during spring and summer.   This project will provide information on some of the major factors controlling the production and distribution of the two major bloom forming phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean and the related biogeochemical cycling of carbon, sulfur and nutrient elements. The results may ultimately advance the ability to predict how the Southern Ocean will be affected by and possibly modulate future climate change. This project will also make significant educational contributions at several levels, including the planned research involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral associates, a student teacher, and community outreach and educational activities. A number of activities are planned to interface the project with K-12 education. Presentations will be made at local schools to discuss the research and events of the research cruise. During the cruise there will be daily interactive email contact with elementary classrooms. Established websites will be used to allow students to learn about the ongoing research, and to allow researchers to communicate with students through text and downloaded images."

Structures exist for many of these proteins in at least one oxidation state, Fe2III-peroxide and high valent iron-oxo intermediates have been trapped, and relevant oxygen-non-heme diiron model complexes and de novo designed protein analogues have been synthesized.  Spectroscopic methodology emphasizing variable-temperature variable-field magnetic circular dichroism (VTVH MCD) has been developed to probe the biferrous active sites and analyze the excited and ground state interactions in terms of the geometric and electronic structure of each iron and the bridging ligands.  VTVH MCD combined with other spectroscopies (resonance Raman excitation profiles, X-ray absorption, EPR, etc.) have further been applied to define the geometric and electronic structures of a number of the oxygen intermediates in the proteins and models and their relevance to reactivity.  Combining these data with electronic structure calculations (DFT) has provided significant insight into geometric and electronic structure/function correlations.  Research now focuses on using this spectroscopic/computational methodology to structurally define the intermediates in the reaction coordinates of RR and MMO.  These studies will define the structural changes of the biferrous resting state associated with activating the site for O2 reactivity, determine geometric and electronic structural differences that contribute to differences in substrate reactivity (desaturation, hydroxylation and PCET), and generally evaluate geometric and electronic structure differences over the range of proteins and enzymes listed above (and de novo designed analogues) which contribute to their different roles in O2 biochemistry.     Iron enzymes and proteins play key roles in many important biological functions.  The focus of this research is to understand the structure and function of binuclear non-heme iron enzymes, providing molecular level insight into reaction processes and catalysis.  The enzymes studied are important in catalytic processes, biotechnology, environmental regulation, and DNA biosynthesis.  The scientific methodologies developed as part of this study have applications to a variety of important classes of metal sites in biology and catalysis.  Postdoctoral associates, graduate students and undergraduates involved in this research are well trained in a wide range of spectroscopic methods, quantum chemistry calculations and enzymology, and have gone on to become significant contributors in academia and industry. The instrumental and theoretical resources available in these labs for the study of binuclear active sites have been made accessible to the bioinorganic community through a range of collaborations which also leverage these resources to enhance impact on the field.  The PI has also attempted to enhance the general awareness of the importance and information content of the different spectroscopic methods in bioinorganic chemistry through organizing symposia, books, overview articles and presentations of general lectures and lecture series on this topic.  There have also been a wide-range of sabbatical visitors spending time in the PI's labs at Stanford to further their knowledge in this area ranging from well established bioinorganic/biophysical chemists, to a local high school chemistry teacher and an under-represented minority Professor from an undergraduate college interested in enhancing research.

There is a natural societal interest in understanding whether earthquakes are predictable; and if they are predictable, developing ways to obtain even a few minutes of warning. We are attempting to address this societal need by studying electromagnetic emissions as one of the most promising potential pre-seismic transients. Our network of monitoring stations complements commercial \"earthquake prediction\" services operating magnetic monitoring stations in California by providing an independent source of data for the public.     Part of the mission of the National Science Foundation's Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) is to learn whether earthquakes are predictable. We are building a network of three ultra-low frequency electromagnetic (ULF-EM) recording sites in northern California in order to understand earthquake physics and to detect pre-seismic transients if they exist. Our electromagnetic sensors include ultra-sensitive magnets to detect tiny changes in Earth's magnetic field, and low-noise electric cables to detect tiny electric currents inside the Earth.  Our ULF-EM sensors are collocated with existing PBO sites, so that any anomalies observed on our electromagnetic sensors can be cross-checked against more-conventional earthquake detection instruments: strain meters and seismographs.  All our data is transmitted to a public data archive on a continuous basis, 24 hours a day.  We monitor our instruments on a daily basis to confirm that they are recording valid data, and we run the data through a set of standardized programs to search for possible anomalies.  It is possible that we will recognize a major change in signal levels or character before an earthquake, but it is more likely that after a major earthquake we will have a valuable dataset that we can use to test hypotheses about the way earthquakes initiate, and to help us understand future earthquake cycles.    We are recording ULF-EM data because ultra-low frequency (0.01-10 Hz) magnetic field anomalies prior to and following large earthquakes (magnitude greater than 6.5) have been reported from a number of different regions of the world. If real, these signals contain important information about the physics of earthquakes, particularly fluid motion in and around the fault before during and after seismic activity. We are collocating our magnetic sensors with PBO strain-meters and seismometers in order to allow signals from earthquakes to be separated from artifacts related to sensor tilt.  We are recording with identical, spatially separated recorders in order to exclude other potential sources of magnetic signals (including man-made signals). Continuous recording of the magnetic and electric field before, during and after, and spatially close to, a significant earthquake, is required to demonstrate the reality or absence of ULF-EM signals. We are locating our ULF-EM recording sites along the San Andreas and other major faults in San Francisco Bay Area, because these faults have a large potential for a major earthquake in the next decade."

Understanding the underlying structure, causal relationship, and feedback interactions between society and urban land-use change is critical for sustainability and human well-being.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will fund research that seeks to advance our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of urbanization, the demographic, social-institutional, and economic-political causes of urban land-use change, and the feedbacks of urban land-use change on these processes. Building on a comparative framework already established by the PI, this project will use multiple study sites in China and Vietnam as observational laboratories.  Recent political and economic reforms in both countries have spurred impressive rates of economic growth which, in only a few decades, have transformed to new urban areas land that had been dedicated to agriculture for centuries.  The research will evaluate urban land-use change in contemporary Chinese and Vietnamese cities as an outcome of the dynamic interaction among government policies, population changes, economic factors, investments and local institutions. First, place-based case studies in both countries will be used to test long-held hypotheses about the fundamental causes of urban land conversion.  Second, these studies will be used to develop cross-cutting themes and more general theories regarding the interaction among socioeconomic, political, and economic process and urban land-use change. Third, the strength of these interactions across time and space will be evaluated with the ultimate goal of offering a new paradigm about the human drivers of land-use change that addresses the complexities and feedbacks of social and biophysical processes. The spatial and temporal patterns of urban land-use change will be investigated through satellite remote sensing analysis combined with in-depth interviews and archival research to construct land-use histories. The causes, consequences, and feedbacks of urban land-use change will be explored by examining population migration, economic factors, property rights, and policy reforms. The research will analyze census data, household information, in-depth interviews, and economic data from national compendiums at multiple administrative units.  The primary significance of these objectives lies in identifying trends and impacts of multiple social processes and their roles in urban land conversion; developing a cross-scale understanding of the social and biophysical transitions underway and the points at which they interact; and developing theories of land-use change processes beyond individual case studies.     The three educational objectives of the project are to initiate an outreach program with a local school through summer research opportunities, to develop a teaching module on urbanization in Asia that can be used in conjunction with a documentary film that the PI already has created, and to develop and implement a new cross-campus GIS course.  The project will offer unique learning and research opportunities for students who are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences across multiple academic levels. The participation of these student communities will be broadened through an outreach and mentorship program with a local school that serves low-income and disadvantaged youths and through active student recruitment at Stanford."

The broad aims of the research are to understand how specific market institutions, such as the design of auction or matching markets, affect economic outcomes,   as well the limits to what designed markets can accomplish. There are three components.      The first focuses on matching markets, such as labor markets or multi-unit auctions. Motivated by a recent antitrust case against the National Residency Matching Program, the research studies how the absence of individualized prices might affect matching market outcomes. The second project considers how auction rules, in particular the choice between sealed and open bidding, affects market participation, bidding behavior and resource allocation. The project develops new theoretical hypotheses and will test them using data from U.S. Forest Service timber sales. The final project studies service provision by local governments. The question is why and when governments provide  services internally rather than through the market via contracts with private sector  firms. This decision is political, but also relates to the classic question of when markets can provide services more efficiently than a centralized organization. The project will examine the predictive power of different theories of privatization using a dataset on local government service provision that is currently being constructed.   Each component includes an educational plan that integrates the research into classroom teaching.    Understanding the performance of auction and matching mechanisms is of crucial importance in allocating natural resources, in labor markets and financial markets, and in dozens of other settings. The first two projects will shed light the functioning of alternative matching market institutions and on the relative merits of two ubiquitous auction designs, the open ascending auction and sealed bidding. The third line of research addresses a fundamental social science problem - where to draw the line between the public and private sectors - and will gather new data to investigate this problem in the context of local government service provision.  All three research projects have direct policy implications - for natural resource allocation and other auction settings, for the provision of local government services, and for assessing the competitiveness of matching markets and the role of centralized market-clearing mechanisms."

These models can be used to build a variety of non-Gaussian real-valued processes, though they are closely related to Gaussian processes. The smoothness of the processes allows many tools from point processes to be used in studying these hitting probabilities. These point processes, based on critical points of the process yield an explicit representation for the hitting probability as well as an accurate approximation, the so-called expected Euler characteristic approximation. The proposal seeks to extend recent work of the investigator and collaborators on real-valued Gaussian processes to these non-Gaussian models. Insight gained from these models should prove useful in studying other non-Gaussian models.     The practical motivation for this proposal is in its application to estimating the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) in neuroimaging activation studies. This FWER is important in determining which areas in a neuroimaging study are associated with a given experimental task. In these studies, psychologists are able to collect space-time recordings of activation in the human brain (more precisely, they can record something associated with activation known as the BOLD signal). They are then able to study which areas are activated by their task, which might be a visual task, an auditory task, etc. Having collected the data, the psychologists are faced with the task of determining which perceived activations are true activations. The results of this proposal help psychologists in this decision, by allowing the psychologists to only accept results with a prespecified FWER. The proposal builds on earlier results in the literature, and extends them to more complicated models of activation."

The lack of tectonics in cratonal continental crust (older than ~2.5 billion years) is a salient feature of the Earth.  Much of the Canadian Shield is one example. Data from xenoliths erupted from diamond pipes provide hard constraints on physical models. Cratonal lithosphere approached its present thickness, about 200 kilometers, soon after it formed before 2.5 billion years ago and has persisted since then.   The second key observation from xenoliths is that the rheologically active boundary layer (the zone of active flow) at the base of the lithosphere has a temperature range of less than 200 K.  These observations allow application of the fluid-dynamic formalism of stagnant-lid convection to deduce the physical properties of the convecting region. Cratonal lithosphere is chemically less dense than normal mantle and much more viscous. It acts as a lid on the underlying convection. The project concentrates on geological implications of the chemically buoyant lithosphere.  The first objective is to obtain the scaling relationships for the temperature range across convection beneath a chemically stable layer.  A second more protracted implication involves basin formation within continental regions. Platform lithosphere (younger than about 2.5 billion years) that lacks chemically buoyant mantle is now about as thick as cratonal lithosphere.  This situation did not prevail in the past when the interior of the Earth was hotter.  Stagnant-lid convection was more vigorous beneath platforms and the platform lithosphere thinner than now.  The cooling over time caused platforms to subside relative to cratons and produced the tendency for sedimentary basins to overlie platforms.  A more subtle effect is that the difference in mechanical strength between platforms and cratons has waned with time.  Continental break-up now sometimes occurs through cratons, but a systematic effect is not yet evident. The project involves the effects of mantle plumes beneath basins, platforms, and ocean basin. One implication is whether plume material ponded beneath interior basins, like Michigan. Overall plume material is a natural probe for the base of the lithosphere.  Plume material flows laterally from thick lithosphere to thin.  This flow is a widespread but poorly recognized and understood process.  Much of the project is directed toward real examples, which effect surface geology. The project has broader implications to comparative planetology. Much of the evolution of animals occurred when the sea went in and out over platforms.  This situation requires the right amount of water in the oceans so that erosion-deposition and tectonics tune the continents to the same long-term base level.  It is fundamental to the rise of oxygen in our air.  Too much water precludes continental erosion and there is no source of phosphorus in the ocean.  Too little water leaves the ridge axis exposed where ferrous iron in mid-oceanic ridge basalt is a sink for atmospheric oxygen."

The key ingredients are the equivariant K-theory spectrum attached to complex representations of the absolute Galois group, which can be regarded as a highly structured ring spectrum, and a derived version of a completion construction at an augmentation ideal. The model has already been developed, and what remains is to prove the agreement of the model with algebraic K-theory of the field in general.  The validity of these results should give striking connections between, on the one hand, the derived completion of the representation ring of the absolute Galois group, and on the other the Milnor K-groups of the field, which are groups defined directly from the arithmetic of the field.     This project seeks to connect the behavior of the arithmetic in a field (an algebraic object which generalizes our usual notions of real, complex, and rational numbers) and the behavior of so-called complex representations of a group of symmetries of a larger field containing all possible solutions to algebraic equations of the original field.  These representations contain a great deal of geometric information, and drawing this kind of connection (between geometric and arithmetic information) has been a longstanding theme in mathematics. The relationship between such seemingly distinct kinds of ideas has been responsible for many of the recent striking developments in arithmetic and algebraic geometry, including Delinge's proof of the so-called Weil conjectures as well as the recent work on the Geometric Langlands program.  The present project represents another facet of this circle of ideas."

The overarching goal of the INDEPTH studies is to understand the basic processes that take place in a continent-continent collision.  INDEPTH I, II, and III were joint Sino-U.S. studies to understand the formation of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan mountains, which together comprise Earth's type example of an active continent-continent collision zone.  Results from these studies have profoundly influenced prevalent theories of mountain building in such tectonic settings.     The focus of INDEPTH IV is the northeastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau.  This boundary plays a central role in a contemporary debate concerning continental plateau formation as an intracontinental response to collisional orogeny.  Recent geological studies and limited geophysical measurements in this region have been cited to argue that a) uplift is due to internal imbricate \"stacking\" of Asian crust while b) Asian continental lithosphere is being detached and \"subducted\" into the Tibetan mantle.  Such models contrast with a competing paradigm, derived primarily from observations in the southern and eastern portions of the Plateau, that attribute plateau formation to ductile flow in the deep crust.  Critical to any model of surface tectonics is the mantle dynamics beneath the plateau and adjacent regions.  Upper mantle geophysical properties beneath the northern plateau have been variously attributed to delamination triggered by instability of a thickened lithosphere, mantle lid detachment and/or asthenospheric counterflow associated with subduction of Indian continental lithosphere.  INDEPTH IV will test key elements in these hypotheses with an integrated, focused program of geophysical surveys across three key segments of the NE Plateau boundary zone.      Geophysical surveys will consist of integrated seismic reflection, refraction and densely spaced passive seismic profiles, a detailed magnetotelluric survey, and a regional broadband seismic array.  Specific features to be investigated by the surveys include:   a)  the existence and nature of proposed Moho offsets;  b) the deep geometry of major thrust faults at the plateau boundary;  c) the relationship between major thrusts and strike slip faults;  d) constraints on lower crustal flow from structural continuity of crustal markers;  e) the existence and nature of subducting Asian lithosphere; and f)  the mode of lithospheric thickening beneath the plateau foreland."

Scarcity of data, the multi-species and multi-fleet nature of most small-scale fisheries, and complex feedbacks among human institutions at the local, regional, and global scale render existing fisheries models inapplicable to most small-scale fisheries.  The combination of local exploitation with multi-scale management of multiple target species creates a test bed for comparison of the biological and socioeconomic effectiveness of management at different scales ranging from the local community to centralized government.  Most small-scale fishing is concentrated in coastal areas characterized by high productivity and diversity, such as coral reefs, coastal lagoons, and estuaries.  These in turn are maintained by complex interactions between oceanographic processes in the nearshore marine environment and exchanges occurring at the land-sea interface.  This interdisciplinary research project will simultaneously consider these different facets of complexity to examine higher-level, emergent behaviors that are likely to characterize small-scale fisheries of the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico.  This research program will address the following overarching question:  What explains the variation in performance of small-scale fisheries and associated coastal marine ecosystems?  Performance is evaluated in terms of resource productivity, economic yield, sustainability of human activities and communities, and persistence of marine populations and ecosystems.  Specific questions to be addressed include: (1) What are the relative roles and feedbacks between environmental variability and human institutions in determining the performance of small-scale fisheries?  (2) How do feedbacks among biophysical and human components of small-scale fisheries vary across spatial (local to regional) and temporal (year-to-year vs. decadal) scales?  (3) What fisheries management systems are more robust to uncertainty?  Research will include the development of a series of integrated biophysical, agent-based, and bioeconomic models; statistical analysis and retrospective analyses of historical trends in catches, effort, and oceanographic conditions; and acquisition of new data through ecological and ethnographic field studies.    This project will make significant contributions to biocomplexity theory, research approaches, and applications.  First, it will elucidate complex interactions and feedbacks among biological, physical, and human processes linked through fisheries in coastal marine systems.  It will integrate socioeconomic, ecological, and oceanographic approaches to produce predictive models of the spatial and temporal dynamics of small-scale fisheries.  Second, this research program will provide graduate training in modeling and integrated social and ecological field approaches to studying human-natural systems.  Finally, it will provide general guidance for the management of small-scale fisheries and a framework for examining the possible outcomes of environmental change, changes in fisheries regulations and incentives, and the new and future uses of coastal resources associated with population increases and coastal development.

In the presence of data streams, evaluating queries or other analyses over the data becomes a long-running, continuous process, rather than the typical one-time queries and analyses supported by traditional database systems. More generally, event-based, reactive processing as a computing paradigm is becoming more and more prevalent, spanning a wide variety of application areas. Continuous queries over data streams are an intuitive and effective approach to data management within this paradigm. Data-intensive applications of this type include network traffic monitoring and engineering, analysis of sensor network data, monitoring call-detail records or charge-card transactions for fraud detection, online analysis of financial data, manufacturing monitoring and control, and others.      The original work focused on basic functionality of a streaming data prototype, but additional issues have become evident as applications have been deployed.  These include query processing issues, such as approximate techniques to handle system overload, performance issues based on scalability problems and issues dealing with the distributed nature of the data processing.  In addition, new work on algorithms for transparent querying of multiple web services and processing of streams of approximate or uncertain data will be explored.  Because stream applications frequently maintain layers of derived data products, it is particularly important to capture the connections between derived and raw data to insure effective data maintenance and analysis.    The history and scope of the STREAM project, coupled with the current popularity of the research area in general, positions the proposed work to have wide impact on both research and education. The project provides Ph.D.-level research and education for numerous graduate students, as well as research experience for a number of undergraduates. The graduate students give presentations and demonstrations of their work at large forums- up to hundreds of people. Research papers from the first phase of the project are being studied in graduate classes at several institutions, and the PIs have been organizing biannual meetings that bring together several data streams research groups. The STREAM project initiated and curates a repository of data stream application specifications, and will continue to expand this repository as an important part of the proposed work. Finally, the software developed is made available for download, and a convenient web-accessible server is provided so that anyone can try out the system without the inconvenience of downloading and installing the software."

Towards understanding electron transfer mechanism, several areas are described: (i) application of newly developed instrumentation for measuring Stark effects in the IR and theory for analyzing intervalence band Stark effects associated with the oxidized special pair; (ii) determination of the parameters that control alternative electron transfer pathways using a newly-developed experimental method, resonance Stark spectroscopy; (iii) application of the resonance Stark method to other pathways created by engineering the RC; (iv) measurement of electric field effects on the populations of charge-separated species in photosystem II RCs, in particular the role of carotenoid cations; and (v) development and application of RC strains in which all native cysteine residues are deleted and new cysteines are inserted as site-specific targets for different types of labels.  Towards understanding photosynthetic membrane organization and assembly several areas are described:  (i) characterization of the lateral mobility and assembly of antenna protein complexes in supported membranes; and (ii) imaging of components of the photosynthetic membrane in supported lipid bilayers by atomic force microscopy and a novel type of secondary ion mass spectrometry with high lateral resolution.  This research uses photosynthetic proteins in supported membranes both as a tool to advance imaging and structural methods and to determine the long-range organization of this important membrane-associated assembly.    By integrating this range of approaches, the basic understanding of the mechanism of the initial electron transfer and the related phenomenon of unidirectional electron transfer can be advanced and brought into the larger context of structure-function relationships in complex biological assemblies.  Research in the photosynthesis area addresses the general problem of the mechanisms by which the organized environment in proteins modulates the properties of bound prosthetic groups and particular amino acid functional groups with extraordinary functional consequences.  An important part of this work involves the development of new experimental and theoretical methods that can have a broad impact in other areas of science and technology.  Nearly every spectroscopic, structural, and theoretical method has been applied to some aspect of RC and photosynthetic membrane function.  In many cases this was the first example of new physical approaches applied to a biological problem, often leading to significant improvements in the physical and theoretical methods, and these concepts and methods are now used in many other fields.  This general area of research has also been a tremendous source of training for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, often serving as a bridge between the physical sciences and biology.  Viewed in broadest terms, concepts and results from photosynthesis research have impacted solar energy research and the emerging area of molecular electronics."

Their underlying hypothesis is that the 3D shape of folded strata adequately constrains the internal deformation such that the orientation and spatial density of m-scale fractures can be predicted using these shapes. The study was motivated by the unprecedented opportunity to characterize fold shapes with decimeter precision using ALSM data and high resolution digital photography acquired by the NSF-sponsored National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM), operated jointly by the University of Florida and the University of California. The folds selected for this study are Sheep Mountain Anticline, Wyoming, and Raplee Ridge Monocline, Utah.    The team addresses three CMG theme areas: 1) mathematical modeling of large, complex geosystems; 2) analyzing large geoscience data sets; and 3) modeling geosystems with a broad range of interacting scales. The team of principal investigators includes a geoscientist with expertise in structural geology, a mathematician with expertise in differential geometry, and a civil engineer with expertise in computational mechanics. The broader impacts of this investigation stem from the fact that folds are common traps for subsurface fluids, and fractures in hydrocarbon reservoirs and groundwater aquifers are known to be conduits for fluid flow. In the environmental arena folds are being evaluated as potential reservoirs for excess CO2 storage. Furthermore, active faults commonly are associated with folds, so the mitigation of earthquake hazards requires a better understanding of the folding process. The intellectual merits of this investigation include the facts that: 1) applications of differential geometry to geological problems are rare, yet have great promise; 2) strain localization by fracturing during folding is ripe for a new approach heralded by recent advances in computational mechanics; 3) the research involves innovative applications of new technology (ALSM) that promise unprecedented data quantities and precision."

The model will include detailed representations of flow and mass transfer, given the geometry of the coral, light field incident on the coral and the internal biochemistry of the polyps and zooxanthellae. Beyond examining the connection between morphological plasticity and flow, the model should also be capable of testing hypotheses relating flow, changes in nutrient, light level, or temperature to a wide range of responses including bleaching.

The study will be conducted in the context of automotive engineering design in partnership with General Motors Corporation.  It will focus on the way in which information technology tools that employ techniques like finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics are bringing about changes in how engineers think about and do engineering, changes in organizational structures and processes, changes in engineering knowledge, and changes in the division of engineering labor.  It will also trace how these technologies alter relationships between automotive firms and their suppliers and pave the way for outsourcing engineering work.

This will be done through development of an axiomatic framework for reputation together with novel algorithms that make the framework useful. This work will be grounded in practical online reputation systems of contemporary interest, and issues arising in real systems will guide axiomatic and algorithmic developments.    To navigate the complex web of information and agents on the Internet, society has increasingly come to rely on automated systems that assess reputation. Some prominent examples of such reputation systems are the PageRank mechanism used by the Google search engine, the feedback based rating scheme for the online auction site eBay, and the incentive scheme used by the popular file sharing system KaZaA. All these reputation systems are vulnerable to gaming by selfish agents trying to improve their own rating. Fundamentally, these reputation systems suffer from a misalignment between economic incentives of individual users and aggregate value to society.  This research program will have a significant impact on several important problem domains such as ranking of web pages and blogs, online marketplaces, and peer-to-peer systems.    Online services such as search engines and auction sites have become an important part of our national infrastructure and need to be protected against greedy or malicious tampering.  This research will contribute to the robustness of such systems.  Additionally, the purpose of reputation systems is to gather highly imperfect information from many sources, and to process it into a comprehensible prediction of outcomes (e.g., whether a vendor will be reliable). Certain national security needs could conceivably be met with variants of reputation systems. One of the great challenges of intelligence assessment is to determine what information is reliable and what is not. The proposed research should help in addressing this challenge.    Elements of the research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses on optimization, game theory, Markov chains, public policy, and Internet technology."

As such, it is an important component of the marine food web for a significant fraction of the world's oceans. What adaptive features of Prochlorococcus strains make them so successful in oligotrophic environments, how have they adapted to changing environmental conditions and how do they acclimate as conditions fluctuate? Unfortunately we do not understand the processes that control either the dynamics or the boundaries of acclimation with respect to changing temperature, nutrient, or light conditions. Furthermore, while acclimation responses occur within the boundaries of adaptation, little is known about the critical cellular changes linked to acclimation, and if similar changes are observed among different groups of phytoplankton.     Drs. Arrigo and Grossman will explore acclimation processes and the means by which adaptation has limited acclimation of phytoplankton by monitoring physiological and molecular responses of Prochlorococcus strains (both a high light- and low light-adapted ecotype) following the imposition of specific light, nutrient, and temperature conditions. Examination of acclimation in the laboratory will yield extensive mechanistic information that can eventually be used to explain growth rates and features of photosynthesis observed in open ocean phytoplankton.       The primary goal of the research is to determine the molecular and physiological constraints that set limits on the ability of the different Prochlorococcus strains to acclimate to both high and low irradiance levels, increased temperatures, and nutrient stress. To attain this goal the investigators will address several questions related to features and mechanisms of acclimation: 1) How do different environmental cues modulate the acclimation responses? 2) How do cells sense environmental cues and convey that information to biosynthetic machinery? 3) What are the specific short-term and long-term responses of phytoplankton to changing conditions? 4) What are the relationships between physiological activities critical for acclimation and patterns of gene expression? 5) To what extent do the patterns of gene expression reflect changes in cell physiology? Prochlorococcus cultures will be monitored during growth in a cyclodyne following exposure to various light levels delivered over a day-night cycle with sinusoidal daylight variation.  The investigators will also initiate studies to determine responses of cultures to different temperatures and nutrient levels, mostly in batch cultures.     The project will generate results that can be adapted to enhance student and public understanding of relationships between organisms and their environment. These researchers will work closely with science educators at science centers to develop and build a classroom version of the cyclodyne, and design a series of experiments around it that explore the interaction between aquatic microbes and the environment. Prototype classroom cyclodynes and an associated curriculum will be developed and deployed in collaboration with local science training centers, including the Chabot Space and Science Center and/or the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Furthermore, detailed plans and protocols for building and using the cyclodyne and the microarrays, plus any software developed under the umbrella of this grant, will be made public on a website developed specifically for this project."

Event correlation is a very powerful technique in publish-subscribe systems, an increasingly popular architectural design choice for embedded systems. Event correlation allows components to subscribe with the middleware with complex temporal patterns of events rather than with single events as in event filtering. This has several advantages: it improves performance by reducing network traffic and unnecessary component activations and by  enabling more accurate component scheduling; it simplifies system development by transferring functionality from components to a standard service in the middleware; and finally, it increases analyzability by making component dependencies explicit, and hence can make systems more reliable.  Despite these advantages event  correlation is hardly being used.  The reason is that system developers do not trust existing implementations: theoretical foundations that guarantee that all relevant events are indeed delivered are lacking.    The investigators are developing a theoretical framework for event correlation that addresses the following fundamental problems:     * the expressiveness of different event correlation languages and the relations among their operational models;   * the datatypes and algorithms for their run-time evaluation;    * the complexity of associated algorithmic analysis problems;   * the development of formal testing and verification tools.    This research is a new direction in the application of formal methods. Its starting point was the development of an event-correlation language by the investigators for the Boeing Bold Stroke platform under the DARPA PCES program. The current project develops the theoretical foundations for that language, and extends it  with memory and real-time facilities to accommodate more sophisticated event forwarding strategies and systems with real-time constraints. Efficient analysis algorithms, based on automata theory,  are being developed to enable system verification and optimization. These languages, models, and algorithms are evaluated on actual complex embedded systems.    The results of this research will benefit embedded systems development at many levels:   * a formal semantics will give system developers the   confidence to use complex correlation patterns, which provides a   concise and easily comprehensible way to express event dependencies;  * a hierarchy of operational models will allow compilers to generate   efficient implementations, appropriately choosing the best   space/time/parallelism tradeoffs according to the target platform;   * solutions to the underlying decision problems will lead to the   development of practical reasoning tools, such as compilers   implementing complex optimizations of correlators, static analysis   tools, and run-time monitors."

The approach is based on static analysis, which by analyzing source code can model all possible executions of a program.  The distinguishing feature of the project is to show that very large applications are free from classes of security vulnerabilities.  Thus, the focus is not just in finding security holes in software, but in verifying their absence.  Previous experience has shown that simple, approximate tools do not find all or  even nearly all security vulnerabilities; the higher assurance given by verification is needed.  The experimental goal is to apply these techniques to the Linux kernel, a security-critical application with  millions of lines of code.    The main technical approach being investigated is based on user-defined type qualifiers that refine the standard types of the programming language.  Previous work has shown that type qualifiers are a natural and useful way to explicitly specify desired security properties that are normally only implicit in a program.  In much the same way that a correctly typed program cannot have run-time type errors, having consistent type qualifiers throughout a program implies that the property expressed by those qualifiers must hold in every  execution.  The significance of this work is that, if successful, it will improve the understanding of how to perform sophisticated static analysis of very large programs.  The broader impact will be in discovering and  repairing new security vulnerabilities in widely-used software infrastructure and in verifying that some of that infrastructure is free from at least some security flaws."

This project focuses on three topics: foundations of protocol analysis, automated tools, and application of tools and methods to selected protocols. Foundational work centers on relating and combining two previously separate approaches: logical methods based on symbolic execution of protocols, and computational methods involving probability and polynomial-time. The symbolic approach uses a highly idealized representation of cryptographic primitives and has been a successful basis for automated tools. Conversely, the computational approach yields more insight into the strength and vulnerabilities of protocols, but is difficult to apply and only accessible to a small number of true experts in the field. Building on past success using several automated tools, the project will devise tool-based methods that leverage new scientific foundations. Three likely application areas are secure group communication and key agreement protocols, schemes for privacy-preserving computations, and wireless networking and applications. In each of these areas, there is current demand for new secure protocols from user communities, there is ongoing activity in the research and standardization communities, and the value of combining symbolic and computational analysis concepts is evident."

The Institute's efforts will focus on understanding the structure of water at the surfaces of common metal oxides, the interaction of water with these solids, the effect of hydration on the structure of solid surfaces, the nature of the electrical double layer at solid-water interfaces, the sorption of heavy metal and metalloid ions onto solid surfaces, and how microbial biofilms influence all of these features or processes. Accurate models of the processes occurring at these interfaces are key to understanding solute-substrate interactions. The multidisciplinary team will use a combination of state-of-the-art in situ synchrotron radiation-based spectroscopy and scattering, computational chemistry, and molecular genomic methods to examine the interaction of water and selected metal and metalloid contaminant ions with environmentally important solid substrates with and without microbial biofilm coatings in simplified model systems.  In addition, parallel molecular-level studies of more complex natural systems containing contaminant species, such as arsenic and lead, as well as bacteria will be carried out, building on these fundamental studies.    Physicochemical and microbiological processes taking place at environmental interfaces influence many natural processes, such as the weathering of earth materials and the formation of solils, as well as the transport and fate of environmental contaminants. A team of scientists and engineers has been assembled to develop and apply new experimental and computational techniques to studies of environmental interfaces. The Institute includes chemists, geochemists, microbiologists, physicists, and soil chemists to ensure that the basic research will also inform more applied research. Some of the important applications of this research include studies that will lead to predictions of the transport behavior and potential bioavailability of heavy metal contaminants in natural aquatic systems and environmental remediation of toxic metals. A cohort of talented and diverse graduate and undergraduate students and post-docs will be trained to work on these complex problems in an interdisciplinary setting. The researchers will also help train middle and high school science teachers in summer institutes on environmental science and will interact with science writers to disseminate their discoveries to the larger public.

Deformable fragments in the protein, ranging in length from 5 to 20 amino-acids, often lead to disorder in the crystal, which makes interpretation of the electron density map difficult. At the same time, such mobile fragments can be critical to a protein's ability to bind to other molecules and thus achieve its function. This project will develop a new mathematical model for a redundant, closed, protein-like kinematic chain, and use techniques from algebraic geometry and differential topology, in particular Morse Theory, and probabilistic roadmap techniques from robotics to determine the structure of its configuration space (the self-motion manifold). Precise knowledge of the structure can be exploited to develop efficient algorithms capable of defining a probability distribution over all configurations, derived from the electron density map and an energetic model of the molecule. The objective of the program is to enable crystallographers to retrieve and study important, dynamic properties of the molecule, and furthermore to develop new algorithms for protein model building in areas of weak or ambiguous electron density. In a multimodal disordered case, the goal will be to identify all substates, along with their probabilities, and to reconstruct energetically plausible conformational pathways.    Proteins are the worker molecules that carry out life's essential processes. A protein's function is largely dictated by its folded, three-dimensional structure. X-ray crystallography is the most widely used experimental technique to obtain a protein's 3-D structure. Flexible fragments in the protein, vital for performing its function, are often poorly resolved in the data, and lead to structural models with gaps. This project will investigate the mathematical structure of the set of configurations of gap-closing fragments, and use these insights together with experimental data and energy models to associate a likelihood with each configuration. Algorithms will be developed to study important, dynamic properties of proteins, and to aid protein structure determination from experimental data. The research and developments described in this proposal will have a direct impact on medical research. Improved 3-D models will lead to a better understanding of a protein's function. An ability to infer the most likely configurations of a fragment, that is known to be of functional significance, may enhance structure-based drug design capabilities. It will furthermore contribute substantially to the Protein Structure Initiative's (PSI) broader mission of developing methods for automating crystallographic analysis. The program is a joint effort of the Department of Mathematics and the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (an NIGMS funded PSI center) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.

The PI will pursue a broad research agenda in algorithmic game theory,  which can be loosely split into two related categories.    The first main thrust of this research will be to analyze the inefficiency inherent in selfish behavior in numerous different applications (primarily in networks).  The twins goals here are to develop general mathematical methods for determining when selfish behavior leads to a near-optimal outcome, and, for applications where this is not the case, to understand the degree of centralized intervention required to recover a near-optimal solution.    The second main thrust of the proposal is a deep and systematic study of the computational complexity of equilibria, such as Nash equilibria. In addition to being an important, fundamental, and as yet poorly  understood theoretical issue, polynomial-time algorithms for computing equilibria are a crucial step toward establishing their credibility.  In particular, we cannot expect a computationally intractable notion of equilibrium to be an accurate model of the behavior of real-life strategic agents.     The above research agenda is complemented by an educational plan which includes extensive graduate course development, undergraduate teaching and course development at the senior and freshman levels, and active  recruitment of undergraduates into research.

These initiatives are closely tied to the PI's research efforts in organic photovoltaics, the broader socio-economical impact of which attracts a wider range of students and more likely inspires students who would otherwise shy away from engineering.    The PI has committed to mentoring high school students and will hire a local full-time high school teacher every summer, aiming at transplanting some of the excitement of laboratory research to the high school classroom. He also proposes to offer extracurricular project and summer research opportunities to undergraduate students. These activities may stimulate students to pursue careers in science and engineering and the hands-on learning will result in better material assimilation and retention. The PI is engaged in curriculum revisions that are currently taking place in his department. He is committed to designing two fun, hands-on courses to attract students to electrical engineering and to offer creative design opportunities to senior students. Finally, the PI is co-writing a textbook on organic electronics.    In the second part, the PI describes a research proposal that concentrates on developing a next generation of organic solar cells that can be produced at low-cost in a roll-to-roll fashion while exhibiting efficiencies approaching or exceeding those of crystalline silicon cells. This is in contrast with efficiencies of up to ~5% that characterize the state-of-the-art of the current generation of organic solar cells. To achieve the substantially higher efficiencies, the PI proposes to integrate several material systems into multifunction solar cell stacks by exploiting a major technological advantage of organic materials. In this approach, cells with different absorption characteristics are stacked and connected in series via ohmic contacts between adjacent cells. Using realistic assumptions, the achievable efficiency of a six-cell multijunction cell is estimated at  21.4%, a two-fold improvement over the maximum efficiency of a single junction solar cell of 11.4% under the same assumptions.    The proposed research program relies on core technologies that were recently developed such as cell stacking using metal nanoclusters and organic vapor phase deposition to realize the objective of demonstrating a multijunction solar cell with a power conversion efficiency exceeding 10%. To address the challenge of wide spectral coverage, organic / low bandgap inorganic semiconductor nanocrystal composite solar cells will be investigated. In addition, the complex optimization of multijunction cells will be addressed by experimentally calibrated, predictive computer models. Finally, a new deposition tool that is based on the organic vapor phase deposition method will be developed. This tool will be used for the deposition of composite organic/inorganic nanoparticle structures without disturbing the underlying layers. This unique capability will allow for the realization of the proposed multijunction structures. Firmly establishing the proposed research effort with the help of NSF funding over the next five years will put the PI's research group on the forefront of the organic electronics discipline.    Intellectual Merit  The PI's career development plan includes innovative initiatives to attract and retain students in science and engineering that are reflections of the PI's personal experiences. The proposed research plan makes a clear case for a new generation of organic solar cells and a novel fabrication method. The plan is unique, innovative and timely and addresses an important scientific challenge. The PI's prior research accomplishments in organic photovoltaics form a strong foundation for the execution of the proposed research.    Broader Impacts  The successful demonstration of the proposed efficient organic / inorganic multijunction solar cells would represent a true breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics. These solar cells will be cheap, will exhibit high efficiencies, and will be manufactured without significant pollution. The socio-economical payoffs to society of such a renewable technology would be enormous in terms of reducing the emission of greenhouse gas and pollutants, reducing our dependence on oil reserves, creating new jobs and improving the image of science and engineering.

This raises the intriguing possibility that this region instantiates a general purpose \"temporal organization module.\" Accordingly, the specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) extend his previous musical structure study with a new group of subjects so as to (a) obtain a more precise localization of temporal processing functions and (b) investigate similarities and differences in IFC and temporal lobe response and connectivity for familiar and unfamiliar music; (2) Manipulate the level of expectation present in the musical stimuli, in an effort to provide additional evidence for the syntactic operations subserved by the IFC; and (3) Examine the differential effects of variation in pitch and rhythm structure on brain responses in, and connectivity of, the IFC and the auditory cortex. Findings will be relevant to theories of modularity of mental function, temporal coherence, pattern perception, music cognition, and brain organization. This research will contribute to understanding the neural architecture supporting music and auditory perception and cognition in humans.    The broader impacts include strong involvement of students, including undergraduates, doctoral, and postdoctoral scholars. The project is multidisciplinary, bringing together two different groups of researchers, one trained in classical cognitive psychology, and the other trained in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging.. Findings can help to better understand prefrontal and temporal cortex dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disorders."

The work includes representation of the influence of the land surface on atmospheric processes, definition and representation of local and regional forcing of atmospheric motion, resolution of key energy-transporting phenomena, and evaluation of the accuracy of the simulations.  The major task is to link (small-scale) turbulence models to (larger-scale) mesoscale models.  For this, two mesoscale computer codes are employed: the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF).  Linking these to turbulence models requires accounting for surface boundary conditions and for velocity fluctuations smaller than the computational grid.  Accurate representation of the land surface is achieved through use of a highly resolved land-surface module that characterizes many combinations of vegetation and soil type.  Turbulence models are extended to the larger domain using recently proposed algebraic stress models to account for the effects of motions smaller than the grid size.  Two-way interactive nesting grids enable improved simulations of the interaction of airflow with the terrain.  The ultimate aim is to develop a detailed methodology for improving local and regional weather predictions by accurately simulating the effects of small-scale phenomena within the larger-scale models.  Other broad impacts of the research include improved ability to predict the dispersion of pollutants, as well as the capacity to simulate flow in a given setting to provide guidance for the design of micrometeorological field experiments."

The latest additions to our toolkit are neutrinos, neutral particles with a tiny mass, more than 500,000 times lighter than electrons.  While the small mass of neutrinos make them already rather \"exotic\", it is now possible that ultra-high-energy neutrinos raining down to Earth from the outer space will help us understanding some catastrophic events in the universe.  We do know that particles (possibly protons) of kinetic energies 1018 eV and above do occur in cosmic radiation and, in fact, some scientists claim to have observed cosmic rays with energies above 1020 eV.   This is a tremendous energy for a single elementary particle, equivalent to the kinetic energy of a medium-sized book falling to the floor from a desk!    As a comparison our most powerful particle accelerator can only accelerate protons to 1012 eV.   We do not fully understand what kind of process can produce such high energy particles but, if also neutrinos of such high energies were to be produced we would have an important clue.  The signals from such energetic particles would be dramatic enough to be recorded in conventional particle detector however the rate at which such energetic neutrinos would rain on Earth is expected to be so low that thousands of cubic kilometers of active material would be needed to have the chance of detecting some.  A suitable detector cannot be built with nuts and bolts but it has to take advantage of an existing body of material!    Ocean water is very common on the Earth surface and our group, with NSF support, is installing a system that will demonstrate the possibility of detecting ultra-high-energy neutrinos in cosmic radiation by the acoustic noise they are expected to produce when they interact and stop in sea water.  Indeed their tremendous kinetic energy is expected to be converted into heat that would make the sea-water expand, producing a peculiar sound.  The sound will be detected, in our initial study, by an array of hydrophones (underwater microphones) located off the coast of Florida and used by the US Navy for naval exercises.  We have an agreement with the Navy that will allow us to install a special data acquisition system that will allow us to find the tiny pulses characteristic of the neutrino interaction in the large sea background caused by human activities and different sort of marine creatures.      This project was initiated almost exclusively with undergraduate students.  The initial feasibility study was done by Stanford Undergraduate Shaffique Adam, now at Cornell.  The first data taking at the Navy array and the relative data analysis was performed by Stanford undergraduate Justin Vandenbroucke who is now working on the NSF Amanda/Ice Cube detectors in Antarctica as a Berkeley graduate student.  A Stanford graduate student, Naoko Kurahashi, is leading the installation of the present system, while another Stanford undergraduate, Jason Kerwin, is building parts of a calibration device that we hope to use in the study."

This effort builds upon the existing strength of Stanford's Statistics department and its developed links with three cognate \"target\" fields -- Computational Biology, Mathematical Finance, and Information Science -- resulting in the attraction of U.S. nationals into the mathematical sciences.    In each of the three target fields, the department will expand an existing successful research activity, which is a basis for classical Ph.D. training, in such a way as to attract the attention and participation of undergraduates, Masters' students, and beginning Ph.D. students in cognate fields.  Such students are quantitatively able and will be \"captured\" into the orbit of the mathematical sciences by offering them a lively experience of intellectual discovery, and demonstrating how essential statistical methodology is to exciting scientific discoveries.    Vertical integration of research and education is to be achieved in part by hosting postdoctoral fellows and undergraduates specializing in each of these cognate fields, and by organizing thematic activities that promote the interaction between undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty.    An outreach and mentoring effort will bring each year additional female participants and members of under-represented minority groups for summer research and education activities in the main themes of the project.    Stanford Statistics has a superb reputation, with a top national rating, and an outstanding mix of faculty with extremely high visibility.  The fields chosen as targets are central areas of national importance, the Stanford faculty have international reputations as leaders in these fields, and the VIGRE effort will supervise postdocs and students in cutting-edge research in these areas.  The effort aims exactly to move students in cognate fields with strong practical skills and quantitative talent to engage more directly in intellectual discovery at the frontiers of human knowledge, under the direction of acknowledged international leaders.      By expanding the Stanford Statistics department's reach into the cognate areas we expand the opportunities of all our students, both VIGRE participants and everyone else in the orbit of the department.  By posing formal initiatives in Financial Mathematics, Computational Biology and Information Science, Stanford will bring new energy and focus into its statistics curriculum.  As Stanford has a national leadership position in the field of Statistics, many other U.S. universities are expected to closely watch this effort and replicate its most successful initiatives."

The effort uses tools from random matrix theory (RMT), Banach Space Theory (BST), and differential geometry (DG) to expose new phenomena in high-dimensional statistical inference and data analysis, yielding practical statistical methods with rigorously-established properties under carefully-stated conditions.  The results will impact a wide range of data analysis problems, including the building of linear models, the testing of complex hypotheses about multivariate data, and the detection of subtle nonlinear structures in high-dimensional data. In the research, the investigators build further bridges between RMT, BST, and DG and three problem areas: (a) Sparse Linear Modelling -- How should one build a predictive model choosing relatively few predictors out of many available predictors?; (b) Multivariate Analysis in High Dimensions -- How should one best estimate and test for structure in high-dimensional data, particularly when the number of variables is large and the number of observations is small?; (c) Manifold Learning -- How can one best find nonlinear structure in high-dimensional data and best parametrize that structure?  Each of these areas is of fundamental importance to the analysis of high-dimensional data, and the investigators identify a strategy to use RMT, BST, and DG to make substantial contributions to each.  This strategy builds on the authors' recent research accomplishments using RMT, BST, and DG, which will be extended to show: (a) how to find the best-fitting low-dimensional linear model without spending exponential time searching through model space -- extending previous successes in using Basis Pursuit, LARS and Lasso; (b) how to correctly test a wide range of important hypotheses in multivariate analysis using the Tracy-Widom distribution -- extending previous results in applying the Tracy-Widom distribution to Principal Components Analysis; and (c) how to correctly estimate a nonlinear parametrization of sparsely sampled curved data in high dimensional space -- extending previous successes in developing the Hessian Eigenmap technique of dimensionality reduction.      The motivation for this project lies in the `data deluge' now engulfing every branch of science and technology.  In field after field, new sensors are creating data streams of unparalleled breadth and depth. As a result, today scientific and technological progress depends heavily on the ability to process high-dimensional data and reduce its dimensionality, sometimes drastically, obtaining a good approximation using a few well-chosen combinations of the original measurements. While many methods of dimensionality reduction have already been proposed, much existing research activity in this area is heuristic and speculative; the tools are often of unknown reliability and their properties hold under conditions of unknown generality.  This project develops methods based on careful mathematical analysis to develop methods of dimensionality reduction which are rigorously correct and/or optimal.  These methods give the user the assurance that important features are captured in the dimensions which remain and that little of importance is discarded in the dimensions that are thrown away. The project develops such rigorous methods in three areas: (a) building parsimonious but accurate predictive models out of a database of many possible predictors; (b) testing for hidden structure in what otherwise seems to be high dimensional `noise'; (c) discovering the correct representation for data which are intrinsically nonlinear.  Strong expectations for success of this project can be based on existing solid achievements by the investigators in each of these three areas."

He proposes  continuing his collaboration with Vasy on new microlocal  techniques for constructing the resolvent on locally symmetric  spaces of arbitrary rank. This approach has already led to a new  proof of a meromorphic continuation of this resolvent, which in  turn will have applications in scattering theory and to nonlinear  elliptic equations on asymptotically symmetric Einstein spaces. A  goal of this portion of the proposal is to create versatile  methods, adapted from N-body Schroedinger theory, to open the  analysis on higher rank spaces to a purely microlocal approach.  This should lead to advances in geometric scattering theory on  these spaces. The other part of the proposal discusses  deformation theory of noncompact Ricci flat Einstein spaces and  of Einstein spaces with conic singularities. Even for surfaces,  the PI expects these methods to give new results about the  existence of constant curvature and Ricci soliton  metrics. Finally, the PI proposes to continue his role as  director and teacher in SUMaC, the residential summer program for  mathematically talented high school students, and also to  continue his other mentoring and outreach activities.    The overall area of research in this proposal concerns a study of  the relationship between the geometry of higher dimensional  curved spaces and the behaviour of solutions of certain natural  equations on these spaces. One example is a subject called  geometric scattering theory, which seeks to describe the  behaviour of waves, measured at large timescales, and to see how  these are influenced by the curvature of the underlying  space. The PI has developed methods to study such problems on a  natural class of spaces which appear in several different  branches of mathematics. Other examples include the study of  solutions to the Einstein equations, which are supposed to  describe possible configurations for the large-scale shape of  space. There are many such solutions; one way to organize them is  to describe their deformation theory, i.e. to see how they may be  altered continuously. The PI proposes to study these questions  for certain of these spaces. A key novelty of his methods is the  development of techniques from a field called microlocal analysis  to these geometric problems. The nature of these topics will lead  to interactions with mathematicians in diverse areas as well as  physicists, and it is hoped that the results of this proposal may  have some impact in these other areas. The PI is also actively  involved in training and mentoring at various levels. His SUMaC  program, now entering its eleventh year, is a proven success in  motivating gifted high school students to continue their  mathematical studies.

The requested funds would be highly leveraged because most of the cost of drilling a 5km deep borehole will be borne by industry and the Icelandic government, with participation from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program.  An Icelandic geothermal power company is providing an existing ~ 3 km deep well for deepening to 5 km depth. This project will provide the first opportunity worldwide to investigate the deep, high temperature reaction zone of a mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal system, which has been a long-standing goal of the Ocean Drilling Program.

Precisely fabricated, ultrasmall gaps are not needed since the overall hybrid structure will be much longer than the organic molecule of interest. At optical frequencies, the metallic contacts will form an electromagnetic cavity around the molecular device, enhancing optical fields to be utilized in single-molecule spectroscopic measurements. Self-assembly of these new nanoscale objects will be investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Electrical devices will be fabricated to study charge transport through single molecules.  New electrical, optical and physical phenomenon may arise from these unique nanoscale structures.  The open planar geometry formed in this work is expected to allow electrostatic modification of electronic states using a nearby strongly-coupled gate electrode, and will reduce fluorescence quenching by nearby metallic electrodes. Single-molecule based transistors and light-emitting diodes may be generated from the proposed structures.  The methods developed will lay the groundwork for developing molecular electronic and optical devices and integrating them into complex circuits.   Intellectual Merit. Fundamental advances across disciplines are essential to the advancement of nanoscale devices and to understanding their behavior. Molecular synthesis, self-assembly, and charge transport are essential components for realizing nanoscale devices with organic molecules. A coordinated team attack on such issues can advance the state of single-molecule devices.

Broader Impacts. This project may result in a new approach to make electrical contacts to single molecules, which will allow study of charge transport through single molecules with different chemical functionalities and length as well as measurement of unique optical properties arising from a single molecule confined in a nanogap. The proposed work will not only answer fundamental questions of intramolecular charge transport mechanisms in molecules with length scale of 5-100 nm, it will also provide answers to technological questions of whether organic molecules have sufficient performance for nanoelectronics and whether the mobility of molecular devices will be dramatically increased by alignment of organic semiconducting molecules between electrodes. This project also utilizes methods to self- assemble DNA-polymer-DNA and nanoparticle-molecule-nanoparticle structures using electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis to allow electrical connections to be made to single organic semiconducting molecules. The PIs will work closely with existing NSF centers and the Stanford Office of Science Outreach to reach a broad population ranging from K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as to prepare teachers of tomorrow for new areas of science and technology.  Two internship positions every year for minority and/or women community college students are integral to the project. One research position per year will also be provided to a middle school or high school teacher during the summer; PIs will continue to work with them to develop their education plans after their summer research. PIs will also reach out to the general public through a public website and participation in various community events.

The metal nanostructures are used to concentrate the incident electromagnetic flux near the active interface of the organic donor-acceptor cells, resulting in increased absorption and exciton diffusion efficiencies. Furthermore, highly transparent nanopatterned metal films will be used as contacts in multijunction solar cell architectures. The high lateral conductivity of such nanopatterned metal films will allow for lateral photocurrent extraction in multijunction cells leading to a reduced sensitivity of the power conversion efficiency to the spectral content. Ultimately, this will lead to more efficient cell designs with power conversion efficiencies >20%. To fabricate the required organic-metal nanostructures, he will use a combination of templated and solution-phase synthesis to create monodisperse metallic nanostructures. These structures will subsequently be deposited using an aerosol technique, simultaneous with thermal evaporation of the organic molecules.    Intellectual merit  The demonstration of efficient (>20%) metal nanostructure enhanced multijunction PV cells would represent a true breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics. The availability of cheap, highly efficient PV cells, manufactured without significant pollution, will benefit society enormously in terms of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and pollutants, reducing our dependence on oil reserves, creating new jobs and improving the image of science and engineering. In addition, the work on nanoscale organic-metal composite structures will help elucidate the fundamental limits of nanoscale metals in optical applications.    Broader Impact  The work proposed will lead to invaluable insight in the manufacturing of nanoscale features over large areas. The modeling tools, and characterization and fabrication techniques that the PI plans to develop will have broader applications in nanoscience and engineering. In addition, he will organize a yearly workshop on metal-organic nanocomposites, establish a high-school mentoring program, and involve undergraduate students in the research.

This project builds on this recent work to address  problems of reliability in embedded software.  While in some respects  embedded software is similar to all other complex software systems  (e.g., many embedded software systems build on standard libraries) in  other respects embedded software is different.  Some of the  characteristic features of embedded software systems are: ubiquitous  use of concurrency and distribution, the central role of continuous  control laws to model and predict behavior in the physical world,  real-time requirements, and often very limited computational  resources.  The project expects to make significant advances by  focusing specifically on error detection and verification for just such  aspects of embedded software.  The methodology is to study an  existing, ongoing embedded software project, which initially is the  Stanford Autonomous Car.  Through experimentation and interaction with  the team building the Autonomous Car, partial specifications are being  developed that can be checked by the tools developed in the project.    Modern software systems are incredibly complex and prone to failure in  very complex ways.  Embedded software systems increasingly control the  physical infrastructure of society (hospitals, power plants, dams, and  so on) and thus the cost of software failures becomes greater with the  passage of time.  Automatic software analysis is one of the most  promising avenues to improving software quality; the focus of this  project is to apply these ideas to the unique aspects of embedded  software.  If successful, this project will make significant advances  in the ability to analyze and predict the behavior of embedded software  systems."

The excavation is designed to illuminate the behavioral changes that allowed modern humans to expand from Africa about 50,000 years ago and to swamp or replace the Neanderthals and other non-modern Eurasians.    Specialists disagree sharply about whether behavior changed abruptly in Africa just before 50,000 years ago or more gradually over a long interval between 250,000 and 50,000 years ago.  The relevant African sites between 250,000 and 50,000 years ago are assigned to the Middle Stone Age (MSA), and the large majority lack standardized bone artifacts, art or jewelry, and other archaeological items that were widespread among historic hunter-gatherers and that became commonplace only after 50,000 years ago.  Most MSA sites thus support the idea of abrupt change.  However, there are a few, such as the Katanda cluster in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Blombos Cave in South Africa, where markers of advanced behavior have been reported, and these sites support the gradual or piecemeal hypothesis.     Ysterfontein 1 contains artifacts and animal remains that can be used to test the alternatives, together with the idea based on a small number of other sites, that MSA people hunted and gathered less effectively than their successors.  Ysterfontein 1 is particularly notable for large numbers of humanly collected intertidal shells, which can be used to track MSA population density, since average shell size probably reflects the number of human collectors.  In aggregate, the Ysterfontein 1 shells tend to be very large, implying small MSA populations, but the new excavation aims to establish shellfish size layer by layer to determine if average size declines progressively through time.  The project will use state-of-the-art technology to date the deposits precisely, but it is already clear that they span thousands or tens of thousands of years sometime between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago.  Thus, a progressive decline in shellfish size would imply that MSA populations were growing through time, and it would support the piecemeal or gradual model of MSA behavioral change.  It could even mean that population growth underlay the modern human expansion from Africa 50,000 years ago.  In contrast, the failure of shellfish size to decline through time would imply consistently small MSA populations, and it would support the idea of abrupt behavioral change near the end of the MSA.  The most plausible explanation for such abrupt change would be a serendipitous genetic mutation that promoted the modern human brain.    The project is intended primarily to inform on the behavioral origins of modern humans, but it will also serve to train American and South African students in state-of-the-art methods for recovering large, unbiased, stratigraphically controlled artifact and faunal samples from a deeply stratified rockshelter.  The need for future generations of archaeologists to expand the sample of carefully excavated sites is vital not only for resolving uncertainties in modern human origins, but also for illuminating many other outstanding problems in human evolution."

This continued exponential growth is placing increasing strains on the existing telecommunication infrastructure, which will need to be relieved in order to accommodate future capacity requirements. Today the main bottleneck is at the level of the access network, which resides between the individual subscribers and the central office (CO) operated by the network carrier. The present access services are based on an installed copper-line infrastructure, exhibiting fundamental bandwidth (Mb/s data rate to each subscriber) and distance limitations. To satisfy the insatiable bandwidth demands for emerging digital services, optical access networks are being standardized and deployed, in which each end user can use a much larger bandwidth (hundreds of Mb/s to Gb/s). Recent developments in optical technologies have made the realization of the optical access network feasible and cost-effective for wide deployment.    Once the broadband optical access network prevails, the aggregate demand will overwhelm the bandwidth provisioning of the current network infrastructure based on Internet protocol (IP) routers. Metropolitan area networks (MAN) connect the Internet backbone and local access points, typically spanning tens of miles. Traditionally, SONET has been deployed to provide circuit links for the voice traffic. Due to the exponentially increasing data traffic generated by Internet applications, many research and standardization efforts are aiming to provide alternate high-capacity MAN architecture and technology. (e.g. RPR, Metro Ethernet, etc.)     To facilitate the evolution of the current network toward the next generation optical networks, the principal investigator (PI) will investigate the novel MARIN (Metro and Access Rings Integrated Network) architecture. MARIN is an integrated network that fuses the access networks and the MAN, and makes use of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) ring technology and wavelength conversion for removing the current and anticipated limitations of both access network and MAN.  It will have the following important characteristics:     (i) WDM ring technology integrating MAN and access network, providing high capacity;     (ii) Highly scalable as the number of users grows and the data rate increases;     (iii) Suitable for smooth transition from legacy networks to the future optical networks;     (iv) High-speed optical routing based on Optical Burst Switching (OBS); and      (v) Exploiting wavelength conversion to facilitate routing for high speed and low latency.       The PI will investigate in detail the feasibility of the proposed MARIN architecture. The PI will perform investigations in the areas of access networks, MAN, and OBS with advanced wavelength conversion, which will become more integrated as time progresses.     Broader Impact: This work will have a broader impact beyond the narrow achievement of the technical goals. If some of the goals are reached, the MARIN architecture could influence the way future communication networks are designed. Hence, this work could have a sizeable economic impact. In addition, by improving the performance of communication systems, this work could facilitate the way people communicate via Internet and other means, which is currently revolutionizing the way people interact and work."

How do the chemical and genetic effects of this variation interact with natural environments to maintain the variation, and how the system of variation has evolved as species carrying it have adapted to new habitats? Hopefully, general rules governing evolutionary change will emerge.       These results and their implications will shed important light on problems of concern to human society. For example, energy processing mechanisms in domestic crop animals and plants are no less variable than in these test insects. Many crop species have longer lives and are harder to use for initial study of adaptive principles than the test system. But there is good reason to believe that its results will apply to such crop species, and will assist in selective breeding to maximize food yield in changing agricultural environments.

SHAQFEH  INSTITUTION:			STANFORD UNIVERSITY      Recent collaborative work in the PI's research group has demonstrated, that the coil-stretch transition in an extensional flow is a \"first order\" transition, a topic that had been debated for 30 years.  In this transition there is a region of conformation hysteresis where two kinetically separated conformation states can exist at the same value of the dimensionless stretching rate.  This is a direct consequence of intra-chain hydrodynamic interactions.  The modeling of the rheology of such a material requires a new paradigm. Under this grant the researchers will use a large-scale computer simulation, projection methods from statistical mechanics, and single molecule DNA experiments to develop the elements of such a paradigm.  In particular, Brownian dynamics simulations will be developed to study the kinetic processes that are principle to understanding conformation hysteresis: the kinetics of the unraveling (transition from coiled-unravelled), the kinetics of the collapse (from the extended to the coiled state), and the kinetics of fluctuation induced \"hopping\" between the extended and coiled-states in the hysteretic regime. Different flow types will be studied, including planar mixed flows, three dimensional linear flows, and nonlinear flows, that demonstrate new characteristics of this conformation hysteresis.  The combination of large-scale simulation and single molecule experiments provides a powerful tool that will allow the researchers to examine this new paradigm in polymer solution rheology.  The study of conformation hysteresis and conformational phase transitions in solution rheology is in its infancy and thus the full broad impact of these new ideas is not completely apparent.  It is already clear that in many instances the state of stress in a solution is dependent on enormous time scales associated with the time history of the molecules in these hysteretic states, especially in microfluidics contexts. The proposed work has broader impacts in terms of training, and teaching undergraduate and graduate students a new way of thinking about the dynamics of molecules in flow.  Through this project, graduate students and undergraduate students will be trained in this multidisciplinary research that involves fluid mechanics, microfabrication and materials processing, and numerical methods.  Prof. Shaqfeh engages in outreach programs already through the CPIMA materials center, which include giving seminars at colleges for under-represented groups. Teaching infrastructure will be enhanced through the development of web-based modules for introducing high school students to DNA dynamics, methods for manipulating DNA using flow, and for calculating forces on large molecules. These will be based on visualization movies of the DNA from the experiments and the simulation codes, both of which will be made available on the Internet."

DNA self-assembly is a key tool for nano-technology, nano-robotics, and molecular computation. More generally, biological organisms are self-organized chemical systems that carry out algorithms encoded in the genetic material, DNA. Biology thus provides clear proof that autonomous chemical systems can be programmed, and that they can function reliably on a grand scale -- biological organisms can be composed of as many as 1024 molecular components!    Recent experimental advances in the synthesis of artificial molecular systems have demonstrated that it is possible to program molecular self-assembly to carry out rudimentary logic.  These experiments also suggested that the occurrence of errors is a major obstacle to scaling up DNA self-assembly and biologically inspired computation. This project will devise algorithmic tools and analysis techniques for error-correction and error-suppression in biologically inspired self-assembling and computational systems. It is our hope that our research will facilitate sophisticated tasks such as counting, growing molecular assemblies of pre-specified sizes (no larger, no smaller), and pattern recognition of complex chemical signals using inherently error-prone biomolecular operations at the nano-scale.    In order to design and analyze our error-correction mechanisms, we will use high level models which are both sufficiently realistic to be useful and sufficiently abstract to be amenable to analysis. The basic elements of our models will be DNA tiles, transcriptional circuits, and DNA hybridization catalysts. Thus, our research will target assembly of and computation with large molecules such as long chains of DNA rather than smaller molecules such as proteins and amino acids.

They are highly active, jet-propelled swimmers, have high metabolic rates and grow at a prodigious rate throughout their short life spans of one to two years. Such squid are abundant in all the world's oceans where they play important ecological roles as major predators. Adult squid serve as essential prey for many top predators, including sharks, tuna, billfish and marine mammals. In addition, squid are becoming increasingly important in commercial fisheries worldwide as they replace slow-growing fish, particularly where these stocks are being depleted.  Dosidicus gigas, also known as the jumbo or Humboldt squid, is a true giant, reaching 2-3 m in overall length and over 50 kg in mass. It is widely distributed over the eastern Pacific, ranging from Chile to Canada and nearly to Hawaii at the equator. It forms the basis of a major commercial fishery, presently the third largest in Mexico. Despite the ecological and economic importance of D. gigas, little is known about its life history, behavior or physiology. Its large size and open-ocean habitat complicate traditional field and laboratory studies. This project focuses on integrative field and laboratory studies of D. gigas in the Gulf of California using recently developed techniques that facilitate such studies. Pilot tagging studies have revealed that D. gigas spends the daytime in cold, deep, oxygen-depleted water (~10 deg C at 300 meters) and migrates at night to shallow, aerated surface waters that can reach 30 deg C.  Frequent rapid dives at night to daytime depths cover several hundred meters in minutes. It is a mystery how these large, metabolically active squid can tolerate the stress of chronic daytime hypoxia at depth. Conversely, warm surface waters also may present a stress that limits the time squid can spend in this zone. This proposal will employ electronic tagging to track vertical migrations of this pelagic predator and to monitor natural jetting and respiration at different depths. Oxygen consumption determined from these data, with calibrations provided by laboratory swim-tunnel experiments and biochemical indices of anaerobic metabolism, will provide a measure of the true energetic costs to the squid itself. Extreme low-light video methods will reveal natural behaviors over the range of a typical vertical migration, both day and night. Thus, this project will reveal what this remarkable squid is doing in its oceanic habitat, why it is doing it, and what physiological and biochemical adaptations permit these behaviors at some depths and preclude them at others.     This study will greatly advance our understanding of the biology of D. gigas and provide a model for an integrated approach to studying the ecological physiology of other pelagic predators. It will also establish a life-history framework that will ultimately be necessary to manage this fishery at the ecosystem level in Mexico and elsewhere. It includes training of a postdoctoral fellow and two graduate students, and collaboration with two Mexican scientists and their students. Cephalopods, particularly large squid, are charismatic and appealing to the public, and this project has significant potential for mass public outreach through a variety of media."

It will examine how well humans are adapting to the quickly evolving digital technologies used in modern communication and social interaction systems. This work will explore the boundaries that are beyond what we normally consider normal, mediated communication and instead delve into a phenomenon called Transformed Social Interaction, a strategy that allows users to systematically filter their physical appearance and social behaviors (as represented by avatars) in the eyes of their conversational partners, amplifying or suppressing features and nonverbal signals in real-time for strategic purposes such as persuasion, learning, memory, and liking. This goal will be accomplished by using well-accepted methods to study multi-person social interaction using networked virtual reality technology, and the research will focus on three categories of transformations: Self representation (altering an avatar's appearance, voice, and nonverbal behavior), Social-Sensory abilities (giving interactants tools that provide unique perspectives and up-to-date summaries of the social behaviors of others) and Social Environment (changing aspects of the social context to maximize interaction goals).    Transformed Social Interaction is relevant not just to collaborative virtual environments but to any form of communication medium that uses digital representations of people - cell phones, videoconferences, textual chat rooms, online videogames, and many other forms of digital media. Currently, over 60 million people use Internet chat per day. In Korea, it is estimated that 1/20th of the general population spend a significant amount of time in online video games interacting with digital representations of other people. Cell phones are ubiquitous and now include digital photograph and video capabilities. Companies actually offer face tracking and rendering on cell phone avatars. In any communication medium in which there is a digital representation of another person, transformed social interaction is not only possible, it is inevitable. The use of transformed social interaction has the potential to drastically change the nature of distance education, communication practices, political campaigning, and advertising. Consequently, it is crucial to understand both the effectiveness of these transformations as well as people's ability to detect them."

To this effect we have formed a multi-disciplinary group of researchers who specialize in the areas of computer science, decision-theory, decision-support systems, game theory, and economics. In an attempt to make current tools and theoretical work more aligned with the needs of applications, we will focus on four important topics for group decision- making: (1) Obtaining and representing preferences of group members. This is a well-recognized bottleneck for decision-making because of the difficult cognitive requirements it places on individuals. (2) Efficiently solving games. Game theory is the primary mathematical tool used to model and understand group decision-making and group formation. Solutions to games are used to explain and to recommend social behavior, but computing such solutions is a notoriously difficulty problem. (3) Group and team formation. Given a group of people with different capabilities, how does one select the best team for handling a given task? Current methods are very limited in how they model such problems, e.g., they do not model negative interactions between group members. (4) Adaptive behavior.

This research program promises to push the envelopes of current scientific knowledge on the above issues, providing new and more efficient algorithms and more advanced models. Such results can have substantial benefit to society by helping government organizations and private corporations make better decisions, better adapt to change, and understand how to form more effective task forces and committees, and by providing them with tools that can support these decision making processes."

We will develop distributed computing algorithms for diagnostic  and prognostic interpretation of the spatio-temporal data. The initial focus is on aerospace  applications but the research results will be suffciently general to be used in many other areas. The  algorithms will use embedded optimization for accurate estimation of the evolving spatio-temporal  pattern of the damage. The computing will be scalable to very large sensor arrays.  The proposed approach is to develop an innovative engineering application in aerospace  SHM area through industrial collaboration and then generalizing the results. Existing SHM work  is aimed at developing sensors, data interrogation methods, and low-level signal processing to  obtain a single damage estimate array. This project will develop system-level statistical algorithms  for estimation of structural health state, monitoring, and decision support based on series of spatial  data arrays obtained from distributed networked sensors. The algorithms will allow for scalable  and reconfigurable distributed parallel computing implementation.  Intellectual merit. We propose to develop algorithms for spatio-temporal estimation of structural  damage that can be scaled to very large spatial data arrays through networked computing.  The engineering need and potential for practical impact come from collaboration with Honeywell.  The place of the problem formulation with respect to existing work is characterized by the  following highlights: (i) We concentrate on mathematical processing of the existing sensor data,  rather than developing new sensing systems; (ii) We focus on spatio-temporal processing of the  data, while the existing SHM literature is focused on obtaining a single spatial pattern of the  damage. Modeling and trending the temporal evolution of the damage will enable prognostics;  (iii) We pursue system scalability through constrained optimization-based estimation algorithms  implemented through distributed computing. Existing distributed algorithms are for optimizing  a small number of parameters. We will estimate large spatio-temporal arrays; (iv) The decision  system design will include uncertainty, missing data, self-healing capability etc, as opposed to  considering an idealized and simplified mathematical problem.  The main steps and challenges in the proposed work include: 1. Formulating models of spatiotemporal  evolution of the damage and criteria of estimation optimality. 2. Developing solutions of  optimal statistical estimation and detection problems through embedded convex optimization of a  log-likelihood index. 3. Developing scalable algorithms through networked distributed computing.  Broad impact. Algorithmic and system engineering approaches in this proposal would accelerate  industrial adoption of the SHM technology by reducing false alarms and improving scalability.  This would enable condition-based maintenance of structures reducing airline flight delays and improving  military aircraft readiness. Other aerospace applications include next generation space  vehicles and space habitats. The transition into aerospace engineering practice will be facilitated  by the collaboration with Honeywell. The research would help in developing large networked sensing  systems in other areas. These include SHM of civil structures (buildings, bridges, etc), marine  and ground vehicles, and industrial plants. The results could be also extended to sensing and  health assessment in medicine, geophysics (e.g., earthquake related damage), and bio or ecosystem  damage.  We will take steps towards developing graduate training in the area of decision technology for the  networked sensors by including the research results in the curriculum of existing courses. During  the planned university visit, the industrial co-PI will teach an industrial-oriented graduate-level  course. The students involved with the project or attending the courses will have an opportunity  to work as interns at Honeywell, which will provide them with an additional practical training.  1"

Of particular concern are certain conventional systems, such as concentrically braced steel frame buildings, which are quite prevalent and whose design may rely on more inelastic energy dissipation than the systems can provide.  The proposed research aims to develop a new structural system that employs rocking action and replaceable structural fuses to provide safe and cost effective resistance to earthquakes.  The system combines desirable aspects of conventional steel-braced framing with two alternative and complementary fuse concepts - shear panel fuses and axial column fuses.  The fuses utilize novel materials and components, including combinations of high-performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite shear panels fuses, low-yield steel shear panel fuses, and buckling-restrained axial column fuses.  Guided by performance-based capacity design principles, the fuses are easily replaceable and can be tuned to provide optimal performance.  Through a combined program of computational and experimental research, the project will encompass component and complete system response and synthesis of the results through a methodology for performance-based design that directly assesses life safety and life-cycle economic factors.  The proposed concept emphasizes damage prevention to foundations and other structural elements that are difficult to repair; inelastic energy dissipation in structural fuses that are easy to replace; story drift control so that nonstructural damage is reduced; and sufficient safety against collapse.  The research will involve quasi-static testing of a large-scale frame subassembly at the NEES facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and dynamic testing of a large-scale frame at the E-Defense shake table in Miki City, Japan.   Outreach activities will focus on a project web site, web-based telepresence, and participation of undergraduate and graduate researchers."

Dynamically focusing user attention to a manageable subset of information that is \"most valuable\" at a given situation and time, and properly displaying this information, could have a crucial impact on the quality of the decisions s/he makes.  To address this challenging problem, we need to make systems aware of and responsive to the general and current needs and preferences of the user.  In this project, the PI will develop new preference elicitation and reasoning technology for use in large-scale information integration and decision support systems that provide user-oriented selection, transformation, and integration of information arriving from multiple, heterogeneous, dynamically changing information sources.  The goal is to support each user's personalized information needs while avoiding information overload yet remaining responsive to the user's changing interests and context, and to the available data sources in near real time.  To this end, the PI will exploit and enhance recent developments in graphical qualitative models for preference representation, algorithms for constrained optimization, knowledge compilation strategies, and decision-theoretic frameworks for information processing and integration.  He will build on his team's extensive prior work in the areas of decision-theoretic artificial intelligence, modeling and reasoning about people's decision strategies, and human-computer interaction.  Effectiveness of the new technology will be demonstrated in an interactive application for field biologists.    Broader Impacts:  The novel preference-based presentation techniques to be developed in this research will in the short run significantly aid field biologists-who gather large quantities of heterogeneous information while in the field but have limited methods for working with this information-by providing them with richer capture and comprehension of information without overload.  In the longer run, these same user interface techniques will be of value across other scientific disciplines as well.  Furthermore, they will be of value in diverse applications such as helping managers monitor information about their organization in real time, or helping rescue teams make time-critical decisions by providing team members with information that is sensitive to their current context, their role, and the team's state.  More generally, this work will help people effectively utilize the abundant information available to them without drowning in it."

The mission of the American National Election  Studies (ANES) is to inform explanations of election outcomes by providing data that support rich  hypothesis testing, maximize methodological excellence, measure many variables, and promote  comparisons across people, contexts, and time. The ANES serves this mission by providing researchers with a view of the political world through the eyes of ordinary citizens. Such data are critical, because these citizens' actions determine election outcomes.     This research  continues the ANES mission for the next four years, but in new and better ways  than ever before. It builds on an ANES history that has made the project a valuable resource to  generations of social scientists. As has been true for every past presidential election in the ANES time  series, a presidential year pre- and post-election study will be conducted using face-to-face interviewing of a nationally representative sample of adults, with an unusually high response rate. This study will include questions specific to the election of 2008 and also questions that augment the ANES time series, which is now in its sixth decade. For the first time, moreover, scholars will be able to purchase interview minutes and additional cases on the time series study to enhance its breadth.    In many other respects, this proposal constitutes a substantial break from the past, outlining new kinds of data collection, new methods for choosing questionnaire items, a new management structure, new organizational procedures to promote the involvement of a broader set of scholars, and a fundamentally different kind of relationship between the ANES and its user community.  One new data collection effort will be a two-year panel study involving six core waves of data  collection with the same respondents, plus 15 additional waves of data collection. The first core wave will be in late 2007, before the primaries; the next three core waves will be spread over the months running up to election day; and the final core waves will be in November and May after the election. Data will also be collected during every other month throughout the life of the panel, but with a focus on matters that are not explicitly political, to minimize selective panel attrition or conditioning driven by interest in politics while producing lots of valuable information on respondents. The panel will allow scholars to study citizen politics in new ways and will illuminate how election year politics affect judgments of the new administration in the formative months of its term.    A second new data collection enterprise involves a partnership with the Ohio State University Center  for Human Resource Research. They conduct the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which has been interviewing a nationally representative panel of adults and their children for decades with breathtakingly long and varied questionnaires. Questions measuring political attitudes and behaviors will be included in these surveys for the first time, allowing the study of developmental and socialization experiences through the life-cycle and across generations.    To help scholars develop and validate new measurement tools for use in the above-listed surveys, an  ANES pilot study will be run in November, 2006, reinterviewing respondents from the 2004 ANES.  The components of this data collection plan each strengthen the others. Alone, each component will  allow a broad range of scholars to evaluate the robustness of old and new theoretical claims. In addition, each endeavor will be designed to facilitate coordinated analysis with all the other data collections. The specifics of the designs of all these studies will be determined by an array of scholars more intellectually diverse than ever before. Its new PIs and Board of Overseers hail from more universities and a broader range of disciplines than any of its predecessors.     This research project includes a new Internet-based procedure for soliciting, processing, reviewing, and providing feedback on proposals for study design elements from anyone who wishes to offer them. All this will be done with an unprecedented transparency to the user community. Because these activities will generate a huge amount of data, detailed plans have been designed outlining how the management of the study design, data collection, and data dissemination processes will be carried out by the experienced technical staff that is already in place. In addition to coordinating the questionnaire design and fieldwork processes, the staff will maintain and update the study's huge and multifaceted website by adding the newly collected data and also dramatically enhancing the study's electronic archives of previously-collected information dating back from the 1940s.    Broader Impacts:  By generating large, multifaceted datasets of high quality, the ANES will equip researchers to learn new and important lessons about the world of politics. These data will be distributed widely and quickly to serve thousands of scholars and to be used in classrooms around the world to enrich research and education. Americans want to understand how its democracy works. The ANES will help to inform the nation about itself, exploring the causes and consequences of voting behavior and electoral outcomes. With such knowledge, the polity will be better equipped to nurture and refine its system of government."

Recent observations of TGFs from the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft have demonstrated the need for a revision of the current model for their generation. This project will investigate a new mechanism for the production of TGFs based on the possibility for production of runaway electron avalanche driven by electromagnetic impulses (EMP) radiated by rapidly moving lightning return strokes. The proposed program builds on previous models of TGF production developed by the proposing team and the main objective is to determine the quantitative feasibility of the EMP-driven mechanism. This includes the development of a kinetically based Monte Carlo model of the partially synchronized runaway acceleration of relativistic electrons by the lightning EMP. In addition, model results will be compared to experimental data, including TGF fluxes and energy spectra as observed on RHESSI.    This project is cross-disciplinary in that it will advance understanding of the electrodynamic coupling between the lower (neutral) atmosphere, where thunderstorms occur, and the higher altitude ionized layers of the mesosphere and the ionosphere. In addition, relativistic runaway acceleration is a fundamentally new particle acceleration phenomenon and the results of this research project, therefore, will have broader scientific impact beyond atmospheric sciences."

Gorelick    After many years of research, it is evident that the prevalent, advection-dispersion model (ADM) does not adequately describe solute behavior in media with even modest heterogeneity. The ADM is based on the premise that groundwater velocity variations are due to heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity, K, which is assumed to be correlated but otherwise random. From a geologic perspective, this premise is often unjustified because connectedness rather than randomness is expected in heterogeneous aquifers. Although a growing body of field evidence now points to the critical importance of mass transfer controlled by connected conduits in low-K matrix, there has been no systematic evaluation of non-ADM alternative models. The goal of this project is to investigate alternative transport model formulations that are based on the mass-transfer concept, and determine the best means to obtain the parameter values controlling rate-limited migration of solutes between relative aquifer conduits and the surrounding matrix. A comprehensive set of laboratory experiments and field tests at the Macro-Dispersion Experiment (MADE) site in Mississippi will be conducted to assess and contrast alternative theoretical models of solute transport in aquifers containing connected high-K networks. The research project will address four important questions: (1) What is the nature, geometry, and scale of connected high-K preferential flow channel networks in a heterogeneous fluvial aquifer? (2) How are such flow channel networks (and flow barriers) related to the texture, structure and grain-size distribution of fluvial sediments? (3) Without specific knowledge of conduit-network geometry or model calibration, can a previous theoretical relation determining the value of the mass-transfer coefficient in the embedded network systems be verified in the laboratory and field? (4) What is the most appropriate model to represent solute transport in aquifers containing small-scale connected high-K networks, and how can the parameters for that model be obtained from readily available field and laboratory data?  The proposed project will allow us to establish a comprehensive, sound conceptual and modeling framework that is useful in practice to account for the controlling effects of connected high-K networks. In hydrogeology, this is important to the accurate prediction of contaminant transport, management of groundwater quality, and understanding of the migration and distribution of solutes in natural environments. This work is relevant to other areas of hydrology and to other areas of science. The topic of transport and mass transfer involving preferential pathways has important cross-over value to other disciplines, such as botany and animal physiology where systems of highly conductive networks embedded in less conductive matrix are commonplace. In hydrology, the mechanism of slow mass transfer occurs when dendritic networks of surface water interact with groundwater in deltas and estuaries. In plant and animal tissue, delivery of nutrients and drugs involves analogous mass-transfer processes, albeit at different scales."

The approach combines data collection and interpretation with theoretical and numerical analysis.  Continuous GPS measurements collected over the past 10 years in Hawaii in a collaborative effort with the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) have shown: 1) inflation and deflation cycles on Kilauea volcano correlated with eruptive activity at P'u 'O'o; 2) the onset of summit inflation at Mauna Loa volcano; 3) apparent temporal correlations between deformation at Kilauea and Mauna Loa; 4) seaward motion of both Kilauea and Mauna Loa south flanks; 5) eight hours of rift extension preceding an eruption in 1997; rapid deflation accompanying this eruption followed by re-inflation; 6) recovery of the P'u 'O'o eruption when the summit regained its pre-eruptive state; 7) six months of transient rift extension following the 1997 eruption; and 8) a series of four silent earthquakes.        The silent earthquakes are equivalent in size to a magnitude 5.7 but occur over a period of 1 to two days, rather than a few seconds. They appear to repeat in the same area, immediately seaward of a narrow band of earthquakes.  The GPS data are being analyzed to determine the source locations with respect to the sources of long-term flank deformation and seismicity on Kilauea.  The raw GPS phase data are used to determine event durations.   Another aspect of the work is to see if the silent events are associated with non-volcanic tremor or other unusual seismic signals. The sources of longer-term transient deformation, including potential Mauna Loa-Kilauea interactions and magmatic tectonic interactions are also being analyzed. The latter involve the integration of InSAR and GPS and will test specific structural models inferred from seismicity and other geophysical and geologic data.     A second focus is imaging and modeling time dependent deformation accompanying dike intrusion.  Analytical mechanical models are explored to elucidate the factors that determine whether a dike reaches the surface and erupts or ends with intrusion, and whether it is in principal possible to determine this while the process is occurring. Time dependent inversion methods have been developed, but the spatial resolution of geodetic data is limited. Including the locations of swarm seismicity accompanying intrusions helps to improve spatial resolution. Dieterich's (1994) theory provides the key link between dike induced stress and seismicity rate. This allows one to invert geodetic data and earthquake rates for the shape of the dike, the excess dike pressure, and other parameters.     The final objective is relating the observations to physical models of dike propagation. This work extends extends existing lumped parameter models by including thermal effects and magma density changes induced by vesiculation. This should allow better understanding of the growth of dikes and their induced deformation with time, and to quantify the factors that govern eruption vs. intrusion.     Lastly, the project will replace failing receivers in the collaborative GPS network, many of which are more than a decade old. This project will support two Ph.D. students, one focusing on seismic and aseismic processes including silent earthquakes, the other magmatic processes including dike intrusion. Four past or present Ph.D.'s (3 female students) were based at least in part on this project. In addition, 10 other graduate students or Postdocs have participated in this research. Our research is fully collaborative with HVO where we have worked with six project scientists over the past 16 years."

Higher-fidelity mathematical models, higher-order approximation methods, and faster solution algorithms have been developed for many applications.  Computing speed barriers have also been shattered by hardware manufacturers.  As a result, the potential of modeling and simulation for reducing design-cycle time and enhancing system performance is recognized today in almost every field of engineering.  However, for many complex structural systems, even the most elaborate computational models remain bound to be imperfect for numerous reasons.  The Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) concept is a unique paradigm for exploiting maturing computational and sensor networking technologies to compensate for model deficiencies and unforeseen system evolution and stimulus conditions, mitigate the effect of design imperfections on long-term as well as short-term system safety, and enable informed decision for maintenance planning and crisis management.    This project will design, implement, build, and demonstrate by simulations as well as by laboratory experiments a DDDAS for health monitoring, failure prediction, and crisis management of complex structural systems operating in various time-scales.  The project will enable advances in: (i) Applications: Development of inverse algorithms for generating hybrid analytical, computational, and data-updated models representing the behavior of degrading systems at various time-scales; (ii) Application Measurement Systems and Methods: Development of methods for preserving autonomous sensor network infrastructure in highly dynamic environments, preserving routing capabilities and time synchronization in the presence of system damage or degradation, sensor scoring and self-consistency checks, and dynamic models for reducing simulator-sensor node communication; (iii) Mathematical and Statistical Algorithms: Development of innovative algorithms for on-line identification of degrading systems, damage tracking, stable adaptive reduced-order modeling, and near real-time computing, and (iv) Systems Software Infrastructure: Development of a proof of concept software architecture that encapsulates all the advances in the above areas and furthermore addresses the issue of dynamically selecting and optimizing at run-time components of heterogeneous functionality over heterogeneous computing resources. Development of real-time, data driven, redundancy exploitation schemes for addressing the service quality degradation of wired and wireless sensor networks embedded in multidisciplinary systems, as a function of operating conditions.     A unique feature of the proposed research is a set of test-beds and associated laboratory experiments conceived not only to demonstrate the envisioned DDDAS, but also to support a strong educational component of the project."

As the number of projectors that can be feasibly assembled into an array increases, one can begin to treat the illumination produced by the array as a light field - radiance as a function of ray position and direction in free space.  The light field has been studied abstractly by numerous researchers; however, physical systems for generating light fields have been severely limited in resolution by the cost and size of projectors. The investigators are building an array of 128 miniature, SVGA-resolution video projectors, and will interleave these projectors with an existing array of 128 video cameras, thereby producing a device that can both record and generate light fields - a fundamentally new capability. These new techniques will yield new methodologies for image-based modeling, inspection and motion capture and will have applications in areas such as in entertainment, archaeology, and modeling and simulation for training and mission rehearsal.    Using the existing camera array the investigators have studied several types of high-performance imaging, including high-speed videography, synthetic aperture photography, and tiled panoramic imaging.  Using the new hybrid array,they will explore two additional problems:      (1) Measuring the 3D shape of an object from every direction at once, meaning capturing all sides of the object in parallel.  No existing technology can do this, at least not at optical wavelengths.  The goals are near-instantaneous shape capture of a moving object and full-shape motion capture of moving objects.      (2) Illumination of physical objects non-photorealistically, to enhance their appearance as seen by a human observer.

Computers have recently evolved to the level where they can start being used to model human beings in a simulated environment. One can study virtual human models as opposed to humans themselves, opening the floodgates for new research and discovery that is likely to have a profound effect on everyday lives. Unfortunately, researchers are still severely lacking methods for programming computers to carry out these types of simulations. This proposal is focused on constructing these numerical methods, with a particular focuson those related to human motion. Targeting biomechanics, application areas  that will benefit from this research include: automobile crash dummies, surgical planning, animated humans for computer graphics and the entertainment industry, models for ergonomics studies, education, etc.    Simulation of human motion is a paradigm of cross-disciplinary studies, requiring combined knowledge of computer graphics and biomechanics in order to simulate accurately with a physics-based musculoskeletal system. This work addresses the need for new algorithms to continue generating advances in human motion. Biomechanics and medicine are in need of virtual musculoskeletal systems in order to test medical devices and surgical procedures. With such a model, prosthetics and other exoskeleton-type equipment to help paraplegics and quadriplegics walk could be tested and refined without endangering humans. However, to enable these technologies, significant advances in the algorithms used to simulate the human musculoskeletal system and control its locomotion are needed. In addition to algorithms for accurately representing the components of the musculoskeletal system such as bone, muscles, skins, tendons, algorithms are needed to model the dynamics of how those components interact with each other and the environment to generate human movement."

Defects in this balance can lead to malformed organs, to neural degeneration and to cancerous growth.  In plants, this coordination challenge is exemplified by the creation and organization of stomata, the epidermal structures that regulate the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor between plants and the atmosphere.  The overall density and distribution of stomata on the plant requires the integration of information from cell intrinsic factors, from local cell-cell interactions and from the environment.  The experiments in this proposal identify and characterize genes required to promote stomatal development. A series of molecular and genetic approaches will be used to address the role of a transcription factor, FAMA, in the repression of cell division and promotion of stomatal development and to identify its partners and targets.  Additionally, new mutations identified in a novel screen for stomatal promoting genes will be characterized and mapped.  These studies should contribute to an understanding of the developmental mechanisms by which plants control the density and pattern of stomata, and may lead to strategies for manipulating gas exchange for improved growth of crop plants and  biomass production. Portions of the project will be carried out by undergraduate students, several of whom are from groups traditionally underrepresented in science; this will expose promising young students to scientific research. Early exposure to the logic and methodology of basic research will facilitate their involvement in future scientific endeavors."

Understanding these features in Caribbean English creoles is not only relevant to charting universals of English and universals of language, but also to resolving one of the most heated controversies in the study of American dialects over the past half century:  the origin of African American Vernacular English [AAVE], the most markedly different variety of English in the US.  \"Anglicists\" on the one hand believe that virtually all of AAVE's features come from English dialect speakers whom African slaves encountered when they first came to North America; \"creolists\" on the other hand believe that AAVE's distinctive features come from creoles similar to those currently spoken in the Caribbean, in part because such creoles might have been brought to North America by slaves who were brought up from the Caribbean in the 17th-19th centuries, and in part because similar creoles might have developed independently but similarly in South Carolina and elsewhere.  Quantitative analyses of relative pronoun absence, plural -s absence and question inversion will allow scholars to address the question of the origins of AAVE by comparing variation in these key features across different varieties.     Although quantitative analysis has been a major source of insights into the nature and origins of social dialect variation in the US over the past four decades, little or no quantitative analysis exists for key grammatical features in Caribbean English Creoles.  The goal of this project is to provide quantitative analyses of three grammatical features (question formation, the absence of relative pronouns, and the absence of plural markers) in three Creole English varieties in the Caribbean (Jamaican, Barbadian and Guyanese), and also in two non-standard English varieties in the US, African American Vernacular English in California, and Appalachian English in Kentucky and West Virginia. The analyses will be based on data from recordings of natural speech in each region. The research team will then be able to compare the regularities observed in North American varieties of English to those that hold in Caribbean varieties."

Hadly, Stanford University  EAR-0545648    Abstract    Global warming and human hunting at the end of the Pleistocene led to the extinction of most of the mammalian fauna larger than 44 kg.  While the causes of the extinction event are debated and of intense interest, the effect of the ensuing community changes on species that survived the extinction has not been well investigated.  However, knowledge about effects on survivors will be immensely valuable to predictions of future biodiversity.  Thus, instead of studying the Pleistocene extinction solely from the perspective of why species went extinct, we are keen to investigate how, or in fact, whether, surviving species were affected by the extinction event.  We propose to use the rich but untapped Quaternary fossil resources of Shasta County, California, to investigate the response of the mammals that survived the Pleistocene-Holocene transition event.  Our primary goal is to determine community, species, and population response of survivors to the extinction event and to sort out whether the response was due to loss of the megafauna, climatic change or both.  Our study focuses on northern California, which is a hotspot of biodiversity and endemism. Clearly, current climatic changes and other human impacts may influence biodiversity in ways other than extinction, and a meaningful way to forecast such influences is by calling upon the fossil record to enhance our understanding of such responses.  The broad public appeal of fossils allows us to inform the public of the value of understanding the impacts of future environmental change from this unique, but critical, interdisciplinary perspective."

This project develops a unified framework encompassing theoretical, algorithmic, and implementation aspects of the universality problem.    We address questions concerning universal schemes in problem areas ranging from denoising, Wyner-Ziv coding, joint source-channel coding, scanning and prediction, to reinforcement learning. We develop a unified framework for addressing such questions, which facilitates the construction of universal schemes for new problems, and leads to new insights on existing ones.

Carrying out even the most mundane tasks requires that relevant sensory information be selectively processed and remembered. Attention and working memory are two fundamental and related mental operations that are frequently called upon during goal-directed behavior. The neural basis of these two forms of cognition is largely unknown; much of what is known consists of localized neurophysiological correlates within the human and nonhuman primate brain. These correlates indicate, for example, that individual neurons within the frontal lobe exhibit persistent activation in relation to the maintenance of task information during working-memory tasks. These persistent signals are also associated with the preparation of eye movements, suggesting that motor preparation per se, and the neural circuits underlying motor preparation, may provide the mechanism for visual attention and working memory. In the current project, the PI will examine the causal role of persistent, eye-movement-related activity in frontal cortex in driving visual attention and visual working memory. To achieve this, the PI will employ state-of-the-art neurophysiological, neuropharmacological and psychophysical methods in behaving nonhuman primates. This project is crucial for understanding how sensory information is regulated during complex, adaptive behavior by the primate brain, and is pivotal for establishing a neurophysiological basis of cognition.

Why do adults struggle to master a new tongue, and often never achieve the same level of mastery as a seven-year old native speaker?  Answers to these questions have tended to polarize the research community.  On the one side, the acquisition of language is seen as a matter of learning and the opportunity to learn.  From this viewpoint, adults struggle with a second language because they have already formed a \"habit\" of speaking their first language.  As the old saying goes, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  On the other side, the acquisition of language is like the coming-in of teeth or any other maturational process.  It is something that the human brain and body are built to do, and as the \"language organ\" develops, it latches on to whatever language or languages are in the child's environment.  From this viewpoint, teaching adults a second language is like asking them to grow new teeth.  Not possible, of course, so adults do the best they can with the teeth already in place.    These two sides of language acquisition represent the classic debate between nature and nurture, a debate that remains far from settled.  With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ramscar brings a new approach to the debate as it is currently being played out in the arena of language acquisition.  Dr. Ramscar will investigate how a very simple, imitative learning model can capture the patterns with which children acquire aspects of language like tense and plurality. This very simple model can then be slowly augmented with control mechanisms that monitor and guide its own learning, which reflect the development of similar circuits that guide this kind of thinking throughout childhood.  Using this approach, Dr. Ramscar aims to simulate the way that acquiring these more strategic learning abilities comes to hinder many adults when they try to learn language at a later age.  This project will provide a number of opportunities for students to step right up to the frontier of language research and play a meaningful role in its advancement.  And advancing what we know about language acquisition may have broad implications for the way that languages are taught, to pre-schoolers and adults alike."

Without a world government that compels leaders to keep commitments, why and when should anyone take foreign leaders at their word? In this CAREER research the investigator presents an integrated program of research and education to explore this fundamental question.  The research and teaching focuses on two potentially important markers of credibility.  Did leaders go public by telling their own citizens about threats and promises they issued abroad?  And did they go legal by embedding their commitments in treaties and other international agreements?  Although the theoretical literature about public and legal commitments has advanced quickly, empirical research has not kept pace.  The fundamental problem, which researchers have acknowledged but not satisfactorily overcome, is endogeneity.  In precisely the situations when publicity and legalization would make it costly to renege, rational leaders will either follow through or avoid committing in the first place.  This leaves scholars little chance to observe and measure the penalties that are central to our theoretical models.  Research has also been hampered by insufficient data about perceptions.  Do key actors believe public and legal commitments are more expensive to break?  To know for sure, we need systematic data about the perceived costs of backtracking on public and legal commitments.  The Principal Investigator addresses these problems through the first-ever experimental analysis of public and legal commitments in international relations.  The proposal has three interrelated components.  First, I will refine and test leading theories by embedding experiments in surveys of masses and elites.  The experiments are designed to measure the actual and perceived costs of reneging on public and legal commitments, while at the same time avoiding the endogeneity that is endemic to observational studies.  Overall, the project supplies empirical microfoundations for a broad class of models and open new avenues for theoretical and empirical research.  Second, the investigator develops a computer software package to facilitate survey experiments in research and teaching.  Scholars need only supply the questions, set a few parameters that control the experiments, and include sound or video clips as desired.  The software automatically varies the content, order, and number of questions to match the researcher's design, and then compile a multimedia survey for delivery over the Internet.  This tool reduces the financial and human costs of running experiments.  Moreover, its audio and visual features should improve respondent satisfaction and elicit more thoughtful responses than standard Internet surveys.  Finally, the project contains a strong educational component including a research-based curriculum for undergraduates at Stanford.  As part of their coursework, students will formulate hypotheses about international military and economic affairs, test them with the survey software tool, and present their findings in oral and written form.  Outside the classroom, the investigator conducts an international relations laboratory where undergraduates collaborate with me and each other on the research in this proposal.  With the data we collect, students have opportunities to make their own discoveries and publish them as honors theses or academic articles.  Each summer, the investigator invites motivated high school students especially members of underrepresented minority groups to intern in the lab and learn about political science.  Finally, the project serves graduate students through a new course about experimental methods in international relations.  Broader Impacts: The project (1) actively involves undergraduate and high school students in scholarly research, (2) develops a survey tool that could be used by teachers and researchers in many academic disciplines and in the private sector, (3) provides practical criteria for judging whether foreign leaders are likely to carry out their threats and promises, and (4) offers insights to leaders who must decide whether to commit publicly and legally in world affairs."

At the graduate level, under-representation among minority groups is even more striking than at the undergraduate level; for example, African Americans comprised just 8.5 percent of graduate school enrollments and Hispanics comprised just 5.2 percent of graduate school enrollments in 2000. The issue of under-representation may even be more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in terms of population and two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states.  The goal of this collaboration - which includes the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Southern California -is to help address the under-representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) at the four institutions. Specific focus will be to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority students in the SBE sciences at the participating institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among under-represented minority groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences. Two principles guide efforts.  Alliance partners will:  1) share ideas, best practices, and resources, and create a network to recruit and retain students for alliance universities; and 2)  build on successful initiatives that have already been developed on each of the campuses so that  efforts can be as cost-effective and successful as possible.     Highly collaborative and innovative methods will be used to improve efforts in recruiting and retaining minority graduate students at the institutions. Support NSF will be used to increase efforts in recruiting, retaining, and developing the careers of under-represented minority students. The Alliance plans to recruit cohorts of under-represented minority students on each campus, thus increasing minority graduate student enrollment in the SBE Sciences at each of our institutions, and to build on current efforts already ongoing at our universities and to build on the best practices that are already ongoing in the collaborative NSF-sponsored effort being undertaken by the three University of California schools    Broader Impact    The program has the potential to influence the future of higher education in both California and Texas. The future of education in these two critical states in part depends on the ability of universities in these states (and elsewhere) to diversify the race/ethnic mix of faculty. This collaborative effort is meant as one way to try and do so within the SBE Sciences."

A low temperature probe has been built to measure tiny forces expected at these distances. The force sensor is a micromachined silicon cantilever. A gold test mass is glued to the end of the cantilever. An alternating pattern of gold and silicon bars is oscillated below the test mass; the coupling between the test mass and the varying gravitational field of the moving drive mass excites the cantilever on resonance. A fiber interferometer measures the cantilever motion and from this measurement, the force between the masses is deduced. Due to the geometry of the drive mass, as the longitudinal equilibrium position of the drive mass is varied, any gravitational force will show a distinct periodicity. Comparison of the measured force to predictions from finite element analysis yields bounds on new gravity-like forces which could signal new physics.  While the Standard Model successfully unifies the electromagnetic, the strong and the weak interactions, it ignores gravity. This poses a great mystery in fundamental physics: why is even this most feeble subatomic force, i.e. the weak force, so much stronger than gravity? Modern theories that attempt to answer this question predict modifications to Newton's law at much longer length scales, up to 1 millimeter.  The technology used in this experiment is at the cutting edge of micro-fabricated devices."

These spaces are important because they often play fundamental roles in the research of many branches of mathematics and in Super-String theories. Specifically, the Principal Investigator will work on moduli of stable maps and of stable sheaves on algebraic varieties. For the first, he will continue his earlier work on developing an effective theory of high genus Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds, a research direction directly influenced by Super String theory. For the moduli of sheaves, he will continue his work on investigating sheaves on surfaces, aiming to uncover new affine Lie algebra representations based on moduli of sheaves; he will develop a theory on degeneration of moduli of stable sheaves and the associated degeneration formula of their associated Donaldson type invariants. The later will open a new channel to the research of moduli of stable sheaves. In a research field bordering both, he will follow the recent leads from Super-String theory to investigate the BPS-state conjecture of Gopakumar-Vafa; this research in the long run will reveal a direct relation between moduli of sheaves with moduli of stable maps, and thus with that of curves, from a completely new horizon. In the long run, this project will serve to broaden mathematical research by understanding new ideas from theoretical physics and to contribute to the advancement of Super String theories by providing necessary mathematical foundation for it.      The listed individual projects are part of research in algebraic geometry, an active research branch in mathematics whose goal is to investigate the geometry, topology and arithmetic property of varieties that are solutions to polynomials. Since last decade, one research field in this branch progressed tremendously in part due to its application to theoretical physics and other fields in general science-it is to investigate moduli spaces of objects studied in algebraic geometry. Of many, a simple minded example is the space of all possible shapes of the surfaces of donuts. Another comparison is like studying space of all possible trajectories of a particle in space. This research project will work on  two of the most important moduli spaces in algebraic geometry-moduli of maps and moduli of sheaves; it will also work to explore the connection between these two moduli spaces, eventually developing a connection that will tie these spaces together. Some problems to be investigated are directly from research in theoretical physics, thus the potential impact of this project will go beyond mathematical research.

As reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the lack of information and service interoperability poses a major economic cost in both the manufacturing and the construction industries.  With the proliferation of the Internet and advanced communication technologies, the exchange of information is essentially free and instantaneous.  However, in order to support meaningful exchange of information among software applications and to bring them working together to solve complex, business problems, the software applications must be able to convey and understand the semantics among each other. Current developments of interoperability standards, although they do provide the means of communication among the tools within a narrowly defined domain, do not resolve the complex interoperability issues in a supply chain, which typically involves information and service integration across multiple disciplines.  This research project aims to address this fundamental problem by developing (1) a formal, scalable knowledge composition approach to identify and resolve the semantic similarities and differences among the standards, thus allowing meaningful data exchange across disciplines; and (2) a software framework that can support integration of loosely coupled, distributed web-based services.  Fundamental methodologies in information science and construction engineering will be developed to resolve the complex information issues that hinder effective information sharing among the participants in a supply chain and to develop a web-based service infrastructure that would enhance the integration of online applications.    Globalization is a major trend in the manufacturing and the construction industries.  Effective and efficient supply chain management is vital to the global market and partnerships.  The coordination and integration of the information flows within and across companies participating in the supply chain are critical to the success of any capital development projects.  This research will have broad economic impact in manufacturing and construction, in that the tools developed in this research will enable information and software applications shared among the entire supply chain, independent of geographical locations, and throughout an entire project lifecycle development process. This research will contribute to new methodologies and innovative use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and to enhance the productivity in the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our civil infrastructure.  To achieve the research objective, the investigators will collaborate closely with researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well as international scholars.  The collaboration with NIST will help define future data and software standards for the construction and manufacturing industry.  Working with international researchers will help dissemination and ensure usefulness of the research results globally.  Last but not least, this research is an interdisciplinary effort between Computer Science and Engineering.  This interdisciplinary effort will provide opportunities to educate future computer scientists and engineers to have better understanding of issues related to ICT and the engineering and construction industry."

By reducing the static power consumption, large gains in overall power consumption and system performance will be achievable. The approach is to exploit polaronic effects present in engineered molecular materials to cause electrons to bind together, leading to the formation of electron bunches in the molecular channel that behave as charge carriers with several times the elementary charge.     Intellectual Merit  The proposed approach uses the novel concept of carrier bunching to improve the performance of field-effect devices. This may result in a revolutionary improvement in performance without requiring a change in circuit design paradigms. Moreover, since the proposed approach is scalable through molecular design, it provides a path toward the very dense and very large integrated circuits of the future. Indeed, lowering the switching power,  , while maintaining a high on/off ratio will remain perhaps the most important engineering challenge for the semiconductor industry.

The theory of String Topology, first introduced by Chas and Sullivan in 1999, now  involves a vast array of rich structure on spaces of paths and loops of manifolds, as well as maps from surfaces to manifolds.    In this proposal, Cohen will emphasize   applications   of string topology, and the recent  breakthroughs in the study of the homotopy type of moduli spaces. These applications will be both to geometry (understanding the Gromov-Witten theory of cotangent bundles, and the cobordism type of moduli spaces of holomorphic curves), and within algebraic topology (the  K -theory of loop spaces of classifying spaces, twisted equivariant  K -theory, and Waldhausen's algebraic  K -theory of spaces).  Cohen, in collaboration with I. Madsen, will also study the homotopy type of moduli spaces of maps of surfaces, extending Madsen and Weiss's recent work on the  generalized Mumford conjecture.  They  propose a longer term  project to use this  knowledge, as well as an adaptation of string topology methods, to understand bordism classes represented by the compact moduli spaces of stable holomorphic curves in a symplectic manifold.                 This proposal consists of several projects investigating the new area of research known as \"String Topology\", as well as related questions.   String topology, a theory that was first introduced by Chas and Sullivan in 1999,  studies structures on spaces of paths, loops, and surfaces.  This structure was motivated by formalisms in string theory in physics.  The idea is to understand how loops (or paths) in a background space can evolve in time. Loops can evolve by changing in size and even breaking apart.  These phenomena are measured by studying surfaces mapping to the background space, that span these loops.  In this project, Cohen tends to study the intersection properties of these spaces of loops and surfaces, and in particular the topology of the space of surfaces mapping to a background space.  His goal is to   apply these constructions to a variety of geometric questions."

In coastal/estuarine systems, this process plays a particularly critical role by consuming ammonia and oxygen, via production of the potent greenhouse gas, N2O, and by linking the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter to N loss via denitrification (microbial conversion of NO3- to N2 gas). Despite their tremendous biogeochemical importance, surprisingly little is known regarding the microbial communities responsible for estuarine nitrification, or how key environmental factors (e.g., ammonia, oxygen, salinity, metals, etc.) and gradients influence their distribution, diversity, and activity. Although the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification, ammonia oxidation (catalyzed by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase), has been long believed to be carried out exclusively by members of the Bacteria (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, AOB), it has recently been discovered that some mesophilic Crenarchaeota (archaea representing one of the most ubiquitous and abundant prokaryotic groups on the planet) may also be significant ammonia-oxidizers. The discovery of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) represents a surprising new 'twist' within the global N cycle, and our understanding of the microbial ecology of nitrification therefore requires careful re-evaluation. The overarching goal of this project is to compare the relative diversity, abundance, and activity of AOA and AOB communities in Elkhorn Slough, a small agriculturally-impacted coastal California estuary that opens into Monterey Bay. Bacterial and archaeal amoA genes, encoding the catalytic subunit of ammonia monooxygenase, will be used as molecular markers to characterize these two apparently 'functionally-equivalent' groups at multiple dates and sampling sites along the estuarine gradient. In order to compile a culture collection of novel estuarine ammonia-oxidizers, for which virtually nothing is currently known, an intensive cultivation effort will also be undertaken.  Elkhorn Slough is a principal wetland complex in central California and is considered one of the most ecologically important estuaries in the state, as evidenced by its rare National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) status. As in most estuaries, nitrification plays a pivotal role in nitrogen cycling and removal in the Elkhorn Slough estuary.  This project will provide critical information regarding how the diversity and functioning of nitrifying communities are influenced by complex physical/chemical gradients and environmental perturbations (e.g., N runoff). The resultant collection of genetic, functional, and biogeochemical information regarding cultivated and uncultivated estuarine AOB and, especially, AOA will be a valuable resource to a wide range of scientific disciplines (e.g., microbiology, oceanography, geobiology, environmental engineering).  In collaboration with the Elkhorn Slough NERR, relevant data from this study will be made available in a public-friendly format for education and outreach programs coordinated by the Reserve.

The goal of the theory is to develop criteria for measuring effectiveness of various computational algorithms.  The term ''complexity'' refers to the amount of resources required by a computation.  In this project, running time or number of arithmetic operations is the major resource of interest.  Linear programming (LP) has been an important computational problem in complexity analysis.  Due to the relentless research effort in LP algorithms, a linear program can be solved today one million times faster than it was done twenty years ago.  Businesses, large and small, now use LP models to control manufacture inventories, price commodities, design civil/communication networks, and plan investments. LP even becomes a popular subject taught in under/graduate and MBA curriculums, advancing human knowledge and promoting science education. Now many other important computational problems are emerging or reemerging. In particular, there has been a growing trend in models, theories, and algorithms on problems arisen in Internet economics, information network, auction/game pricing, as well as social organization issues enabled through World Wide Web. The aim of the project is to further develop and extend complexity theories and efficient methods to responding these emergencies, where there is strong interest in solving them faster and more accurate due to their wide applications in today's US service economy, such as trade, auction, negotiation, and information aggregation.  More specifically, the following research objectives and activities are proposed:  Exchange market equilibrium: develop the algorithmic and complexity research on solving several exchange market price equilibrium problems, including the Nash equilibrium, where many challenging questions are open and need answerers; Auction-game mechanism design: propose and analyze a convex pari-mutuel call auction pricing mechanism for contingent claim markets and to develop a forecast model for some uncertain future events; Real-time or dynamic pricing: conduct research for pricing real-time or dynamic auctions, such as innovative auction markets in key-word search to sell advertisements for Internet search business.    The proposed research will deepen our understanding of complexities of these emerging computational price equilibrium problems and possibly resolve important open questions on whether or not they admit high efficient algorithms. The research activities have an influence on society by the project's very nature: improved market trading systems and economic pricing mechanism. Progress in the areas of developing efficient algorithms for solving large-scale game/equilibrium problems will be of great significance in improving the efficiency of Internet/information systems and on-line/network business service management. Strengthening research in this area will contribute to the national interest in industrial competitiveness, scientific understanding, technology innovation, and human knowledge.

He is proposing to study solutions of the constraint equations which are not time symmetric with an eye to the study of the general Penrose inequality as well as an analysis of the stability of the constraint manifold. The latter topic is important for understanding numerical stability for the vacuum Einstein equations. Professor Schoen is also proposing to study the construction of submanifolds which are calibrated by the special lagrangian calibrating form. He plans to apply ideas from geometric measure theory to this problem. He also plans to study hamiltonian stationary submanifolds in dimension greater than two; in particular, the hamiltonian stationary tangent cones will be studied. Professor Schoen intends to investigate stable minimal surfaces which remain stable under coverings with the hope of showing that these are holomorphic in general situations. Finally, he intends to study geodesic completeness properties of hypersurfaces in Minkowski space of constant Gauss-Kronecker curvature.     Professor Schoen's project will lead to a better understanding of solutions of the Einstein equations of General Relativity. A better theoretical understanding is essential for the success of accurate numerical modeling of solutions. Numerical modeling is important for predicting the nature of the gravitational radiation which arises from dynamic situations, and NSF currently has a large project, LIGO, which is attempting to measure this radiation. He believes that the theoretical work of this project will be helpful for the numerics. The remainder of Professor Schoen's proposed work involves the use of geometric methods to understand the behavior of surface interfaces, such as soap films and soap bubbles, of varying dimension which arise in physical situations. These natural geometric objects can be used to describe subtle properties of the spaces in which they reside. These spaces arise in physical models such as string theory where they play a basic role."

The first project aims to define the Gromov-Witten  invariants of a symplectic manifold relative a singular subspace  (with mild singularities, e.g.  normal crossings) and to use  those invariants to prove a generalized symplectic sum  formula. The project uses both geometric and analytical methods  to investigate what happens to the moduli spaces of holomorphic  maps during certain kinds of natural degenerations, revealing  surprising new features but also new challenges and  complications. There are several interesting applications of this  work, one of them presented as a separate project, which involves  the idea of using a Donaldson divisor to give a simple geometric  definition of the virtual fundamental cycle.  The third project  is motivated by a conjecture made by two string theorists,  R. Gopakumar and C. Vafa. The PI has been working with Thomas  Parker on a structure theorem for Gromov invariants in 6  dimensions; this would have many of the same consequences as the  Gopakumar-Vafa Conjecture, and it ties in nicely with C. Taubes  deep work on the relation between Seiberg-Witten and Gromov  invariants in 4 dimensions.    The proposed work lies at the intersection of string theory and  symplectic topology.  String theory developed as a potential  candidate for unifying general relativity and particle physics.  The details of this theory have turned out to be extraordinarily  rich, and have inspired many remarkable results in  mathematics. But results in mathematics have also guided and  inspired many new discoveries in string theory.  It is hoped that  this project will have the broader impact of adding momentum to  the growing interaction between mathematicians and theoretical  physicists.  In particular, one of the themes running through all  the projects in this proposal is that symplectic topology can  contribute insights into string theory. The research and other  activities of the PI also have impact on the education of next  generation of mathematicians.  One of the proposed projects will  involve graduate students, engaging them in cutting-edge research  early in their graduate career.

It is important to have explicit, quantitative information about a geometric structure and to understand how it is connected with the combinatorial and topological properties of the manifold.  The model manifolds constructed by Minsky and used in the solution of the Ending Lamination Conjecture in Kleinian groups are determined by combinatorial data  and reflect geometric properties of the mapping class group. These models should be useful in studying closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  On the other hand, techniques that have been successful in studying closed manifolds, like hyperbolic Dehn surgery, deformation theory, and ideal triangulations should help provide further refinements in  our understanding of Kleinian groups.  The goal of this project is to combine the analytic and geometric techniques developed over the last several years by the PI and his collaborators with some of the new ideas that have emerged during the recent solutions of major conjectures in Kleinian groups.    The study of 3-dimensional manifolds combines geometric, algebraic, and analytic tools.  It can be a very approachable subject because the objects of study include things like knots that are easy to  describe and visualize geometrically.  Even the deeper properties, like hyperbolic structures, can be presented in an inviting manner with current graphical capabilities.

A case is put forth that the recent statistical reexamination of the  Gallium Experiment/Gallium Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande data by PI  Sturrock and collaborators now provides a convincing demonstration that the solar  neutrino flux is not constant - rather, it varies with patterns that provide insight into the  underlying nature of neutrinos and processes in the deep solar interior. The goal of this  work is to provide critical observational inputs through statistical analyses of neutrino  observations for use by the theory community, including two collaborators currently  developing a model in which electron neutrinos couple to a sterile neutrino through a  transition magnetic moment (thereby tying the observed flux to time-dependent magnetic  phenomena, e.g., rotation). Included in this effort is a power-spectrum (for non-normal  estimates) and time-frequency analyses. A second goal is to examine the relationship  between measurements of the flux and other solar variables including measurements  made by the Michelson Doppler Imager helioseismology experiment on the Solar and  Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft, since this experiment probes the deep solar interior,  where neutrino flux modulation is believed to occur.  The results of this work and its implications will be shared with the public through  outreach efforts to local groups and to the Science Explorers Club.\" The PI Sturrock will  also develop the concepts of scientific interference\" (an approach to determining the  nature\" of science) both to organize arguments/evidence for and against solar neutrino  variability and to explain the principle at the college science teacher level in an  appropriate journal article."

Tectonic models based on these hypotheses can be broadly associated with three competing surface uplift and extension mechanisms: (1) impingement of the Yellowstone hot spot plume at the base of the lithosphere, (2) delamination of mantle lithosphere, and (3) buoyancy-related flow driven by gradients in gravitational potential energy. Each of these models predicts distinct and testable topographic responses. Cenozoic paleoelevation history is being reconstructed for metamorphic core complexes and adjacent basins in Montana, Nevada, and Utah using stable isotope methods. This paleoaltimetry study will provide a unique set of constraints, which combined with geophysical and geologic data sets, should yield a better understanding of the driving forces behind Cenozoic extension in the northern Basin and Range and the North American Cordillera. This research project builds upon previous paleoelevation studies of metamorphic core complexes and intermontane basins in the western United States that suggest a history of spatially and temporally varying topographic development of western North America with surface uplift migrating southward with time.    Large mountain ranges are found on all the Earth's continents.  How these mountain ranges grow, however, remains one of the more elusive questions in earth sciences.  Understanding the topographic history of mountain ranges is critical for evaluating different tectonic models as well as determining how the growth of mountains affects climate change.  This is particularly true for the Cenozoic (last 65 million years of Earth's history) because it has been proposed that the construction of the large Cenozoic mountain belts, such as the Himalaya/Tibet and western North America Cordillera, have altered the Earth's climate. This study examines the Cenozoic topographic and climate history of the western U.S. Cordillera using stable isotope paleoaltimetry and evaluates the tectonic models that have been proposed for this region. It will provide new insights regarding how the American western mountain ranges formed as well as critical information on the links and feed-backs between growth of mountain ranges and climate."

A specific objective is to use what are called fluxional catalysts to produce new polymeric materials from readily available monomer feedstocks.  A second objective is to develop catalysts for the copolymerization of certain types of monomers that are currently incompatible with most coordination catalysts.  More specifically a combination of experimental and theoretical methods will be used to understand how these reactions occur in order to develop additional, more active catalysts.  In addition new classes of catalysts capable of producing syndiotactic (stereoregular) polystyrene/alpha-olefin copolymers and block copolymers will be generated.  It is anticipated 1) that development of a detailed understanding of this polymerization behavior as a function of the conformational preferences and dynamics of coordination compounds will provide a rational basis for developing new methods in catalysis, 2) that the application of reversible bond cleavage to interconvert Ti(III) and Ti(IV) catalysts will provide a new paradigm for catalysis and a new strategy for mediating oxidation/reduction equilibria in coordination complexes, and 3) that the new materials prepared will provide new opportunities for investigating how the structure of polymers influences their properties.     Broader Impacts. Since the catalytic polymerization of olefins is the basis of an industry that produces over 100 billion lbs of polyolefins per year, it is anticipated that the proposed studies will have a huge scientific and economic impact.  Students will be engaged in a highly interdisciplinary research area that combines organic and organometallic synthetic and mechanistic chemistry, computational methods, catalytic olefin polymerization, and the study of polymer structure and properties and thus they will get a very broad education.

It tests whether the now-defunct practice of footbinding served as a form of labor control, pushing girls and women to participate in lucrative handcraft production. The project contributes to gender studies, economic development studies, and their integration.  If, as it turns out, economic change is more important in eliminating practices that are often viewed as injurious to women's bodies (such as female circumcision), then efforts to change these practices must address their economic basis, and not only work on the level of education and advocacy. Evidence from southern China suggests that footbinding was strongly correlated with local economic practices, but the southern pattern has never been tested in north and central China. Time is running out, as most elderly women who are the best source of information will be gone within the decade. This project surveys 1600 women about their own labor and that of their older female relatives, which will produce  data on about 8,000 women going back to the 1880s. Sixteen sites across eight provinces were carefully selected to include locales with historical data available and to represent regional diversity.     This project addresses the common misconceptions that girls played an insignificant economic role in China prior to the emergence of factory industrialism, and that footbinding, driven by cultural beliefs about beauty and sexuality, made female labor nearly worthless. Producing more accurate estimates of the labor inputs of Chinese girls and women contributes to contemporary research on global economic history. Understanding the economic implications of footbinding, which was once at the center of heated debate over women's bodily well-being, social integration, traditional cultural values, and human rights, contributes to current policy debates about women's rights."

The project focuses on TinyOS and seeks to solve difficult component composition problems that even expert developers encounter.  The long-term vision is to make creating robust applications largely from existing components feasible for non-expert developers.  The research is based on three complementary approaches. First, the PIs are developing tool support for giving developers advice about how to meet time constraints.  Timing problems are difficult to deal with in TinyOS because they cut across component boundaries in non-intuitive ways.  Second, the PIs are adding support for component interface contracts to TinyOS.  Contracts verify that the \"rules\" for using a component are respected, pinpointing errors when developers misunderstand or misuse an interface, avoiding difficult debugging sessions.  Finally, based on their experiences with the tradeoffs between static and dynamic timing and contract checking, the PIs are revisiting the basic abstractions and structure of TinyOS, redesigning them to be more easily checkable, and therefore more reliable.  The intent is to improve reliability by rendering many classes of bugs impossible by design, rather than relying on heroic analysis and testing techniques"

The control of the genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis or utilization has served as one of the most important paradigms for the discovery and atomic level characterization of novel genetic regulatory mechanisms in bacteria. The diverse mechanisms sense both the availability of free tryptophan and the level of charging (aminoacylation) of tRNATrp. This project will continue these investigations by investigating the control of the tna operon (tryptophan utilization) in Escherichia coli and the at operon (tryptophan regulation) in Bacillus licheniformis. Structural and regulatory studies will be performed using the tna operon to identify the molecular features in the nascent TnaC peptidyl-tRNA and in the ribosome exit tunnel that are responsible for tryptophan binding to the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome and the concomitant  inhibition of peptidyl-tRNA cleavage at the tnaC stop codon. Specific nucleotide substitutions or amino acid replacements will be introduced in rRNA and r-proteins to identify the ribosomal determinants essential for recognition of the features of the nascent peptide and free tryptophan. An efficient in vitro system will be used in which purified ribosomes are examined. This project is revealing that the translating ribosome is not a non-specific protein-synthesizing machine. Rather, the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide can influence a ribosome's ability to catalyze polypeptide elongation, or cleavage at a stop codon. Studies will also be performed with the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus licheniformis to determine the regulatory features of the leader peptide coding region of the at operon. This coding region contains three dispersed tryptophan codons at which a translating ribosome could stall if tryptophan-charged tRNATrp is unavailable.  Ribosome stalling at either of the first two tryptophan codons is predicted to increase synthesis of the AT regulatory protein whereas ribosome stalling at the third tryptophan codon is predicted to reduce AT synthesis. This project provides training for post doctoral students and is establishing new paradigms for the post transcriptional regulation of gene expression in microorganisms."

Cook  Institution: Stanford University  SES-0623529  PI: Coye Cheshire  Institution: UC-Berkeley    Social scientists have accumulated a large and growing body of theory and data on many distinct types of social exchange systems.  It has been demonstrated through a long history of social exchange experiments that different forms of exchange yield different outcomes, to some extent as a function of the differences that exist in levels of risk and uncertainty inherent in these different forms of exchange.  There is, however, little or no research on the process of transitioning between different modes of social exchange.  This collaborative experimental research between Stanford University and UC-Berkeley, develops a set of theoretically driven arguments for social exchange systems that transition (or shift) between reciprocal exchange and binding or non-binding negotiated exchange (which is only one of the possible types of transition in modes of exchange).  This study uses a new set of social exchange experiments with 4-6 person groups who interact across a computer-mediated network.  Some of  the specific hypotheses include: an increase in contributions to partners when the form of the exchange shifts exogenously from reciprocal to negotiated exchange, an increase in assessments of a given partner's trustworthiness in reciprocal exchange when it precedes negotiated exchange, and the decreased desire to initiate (endogenously) a shift from reciprocal to negotiated exchange as subjects experience increased levels of cooperation in the former mode of exchange.  The broader impact of this proposed research includes the capacity to directly address questions about processes and outcomes in rapidly changing systems of exchange such as business-to-business transactions (B2B), Internet-based exchanges, and other forms of real-world social exchange.  Furthermore, this research advances the theoretical tradition of social exchange processes by developing the first series of testable hypotheses concerning the effects of shifts between different modes of exchange and examining how individual attitudes and attributions about exchange partners change as a result of these transitions. Given increased interest in real-world systems of B2B and Internet-based exchange (which often challenge many assumptions about exchange processes, attributions, and outcomes), the opportunities for theoretical development and real-world applications of the study of transitions in modes of exchange are substantial."

These surface-associated, structured microbial communities are of medical and environmental importance. Stability and resilience of mature biofilms is controlled by two interrelated cellular processes: attachment and detachment. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of detachment and attachment are largely unknown. This project explores the first steps towards a physiological, genetic and biochemical understanding of the detachment/attachment processes. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a geochemically important microbe that metabolically interacts with Fe- and Mn-containing soil minerals in biofilms serves as model microbe for these studies. The multi-tiered approach involves physiological studies on detachment including energetic and cell mixing experiments. The results expected from this research should provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of microbial detachment from biofilms.  While the initial processes of biofilm formation have been investigated in the past, the important questions of the control of stability of established biofilms and their long-term survival have not been addressed. These studies will reveal some important physiological, mechanistic, and genetic principles of determining biofilm stability.

Expected significance of proposed research  This research seeks to provide a physiological and molecular understanding of microbial attachment, detachment, and the transitioning between both states using S. oneidensis as a model system. In addition, the results will also serve as a useful basis for the applied environmental and medical fields to manage microbial biofilms. For example, the dissolution of biofilms beneficial for wastewater and groundwater treatment often needs to be prevented or controlled, whereas corrosion of pipes, ships, as well as formation of medically detrimental biofilms on teeth (caries), subgingival pockets, and catheters could be mitigated (or prevented) by engineered manipulation of the microbial detachment physiology. Therefore, this research is not only of fundamental but also applied relevance."

For instance, a course on genetics and genomics can be offered prior to completion of the math and chemistry prerequisites that ordinarily delay student exposure to and appreciation of many advanced science topics.  The proposed materials may also serve as a key component for creating informed citizens who understand science, are excited about the fruits of scientific research, and advocate for public support of scientific research and education.  Because of the modular design of these materials, they are also appropriate for use in many courses that present units on genetics or genomic sciences.  This model is tested by evaluating these educational materials in several different courses, including cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, and molecular biology, that are offered at 12 community colleges, a state university, and a private university in California.  Thus, the strengths and limitations of the courseware are evaluated under widely varying classroom conditions."

The work is motivated by a common desire to push novel computational approaches to the limit that most significant problems can be tackled with available computational resources (both in terms of algorithmic advances and in terms of solving the largest). The project represents a broad range of methods, from physics-based simulation, to genomics and proteomics, to biostatistics, to joint experimental/ computational methodology. The enabled research can be grouped in four areas:    -Simulation and modeling of macromolecular structures,  -Analysis of sequence and genomic/proteomic datasets,  -Modeling of very large datasets, and   -Fundamental computer science.    Besides enabling research, the instrument is an advance in commodity computing combining the low cost of Linux clusters with the power of shared memory machines. Out comes a supercomputer with a very low total cost of ownership. Highlights include:    -Molecular dynamics simulation based on quantum mechanically derived force fields: to understand hydrophobic effect that drives protein folding and to get closer to the goal of accurately modeling protein folding  -Modeling of structure water in ribosome: to understand protein structure and function in the cellular milieu  -Integration of genetic networks using genome sequence and experimental data: to appropriately combine disparate information into a single unifying framework based on common gene function and evolutionary descent  -Whole genomic alignments and inference of evolutionary constraints: to predict impact of population genetic variation on the function of the organism, at the interface of population genetics and evolutionary theory  -Simulation of human motion based on accurate, yet tractable, models of the neuromusculoskeletal system and simulation of blood flow in aorta: areas known for applied value  -Development of algorithms for fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, graphics, segmentation, computer vision: areas of computer science with a strong mathematical component, as well as applied aspects such as movie animations"

Billions of US dollars are spent every year so that one can learn the nation's unemployment rate, its inflation rate, and much more about the experiences of Americans that govern policy-making, cost-effectively and quickly through surveys.  In recent years, there has also been a sharp increase in the use of survey data by academic researchers to enhance theory development in a wide range of important domains, providing insights into the nature of contemporary social life, the workings of the human mind, and approaches to solving pressing national problems.      At the same time, the nation has experienced a sharp increase in the costs of conducting high-quality surveys, coupled with a decline in the response rates of such surveys. The U.S. federal, state, and local governments, the private sector, and the academy therefore need quick innovation in survey methodology to permit cost-effective collection of accurate data from highly representative samples in the future.    This project will take an unprecedented step to test a new methodology to achieve this goal.  If this trial works, the methodology will be available for use by all organizations around the country that are committed to making informed policy-making decisions.  The tool to be built will bring a new standard of accuracy to data, provide broad accessibility to social scientists at reduced cost, and blend the analytic power afforded by a state-of-the art computer network laboratory with the generalization power afforded by a representative sample survey of American households. Specifically, the project will purchase computer hardware, install the hardware in a representative sample of 1,000 households across the country, and calibrate the national network of computers via the Internet, testing to assure that it works properly to permit social science survey data collection. The network will enable path-breaking research that could not be achieved by any methodology currently in use and would considerably increase the value of the data collected, analyzed, and reported.    Sampling statisticians will draw a representative sample of American households using an innovative method based upon U.S. postal service mailing address lists. Then, installation specialists will visit the selected households, randomly select an adult household member, conduct a brief interview face-to-face (with an expected response rate of about 80%), and then offer him or her a free laptop computer and free high-speed Internet connection in exchange for using the equipment to provide data once a month via the Internet. The installation specialists will install the computers, walk respondents through the process of using them, and calibrate the equipment on site to work properly. Then, once a month, respondents will provide a new round of data by accessing a secure webpage, and calibration of the computer network will be conducted.  The opportunity to collect data on this platform will be made available to government agencies, businesses, and academic scholars.  A range of different evaluations of the network will be performed to assess its effectiveness.      If this effort is successful, it will provide scientific and practical justification for the implementation of this approach to experimental and non-experimental survey data collection on a much larger scale, which will enable academic researchers, federal, state, and local government agencies, and private commercial and non-commercial organizations to conduct the highest quality research at a practical price."

Furthermore, Congress has passed a number of laws protecting the air, water, and other aspects of the environment, which suggest that the environmental movement is a force in American politics.  The research will analyze the impact of international and national environmental protest and social movement advocacy groups on environmental legislation in the U.S. Congress. To address this question, the investigators will collect information on protest events, activities by environmental organizations, and histories of environmental bills as these narratives unfold over time. Specifically, they will assemble information on environmental legislative histories and environmental social movements, in order to study the central argument that the effects of congressional-level factors, public opinion, lobbyist activities, and social movement activities all influence policy outcomes, but that they do so at different stages in the legislative process. The research contributes to sociological knowledge by assessing the impact of protest and advocacy activities of citizens and organizations on legislative change.  It highlights the specific sequence of events in the legislative process that may influence the likelihood of success or failure at each stage of the process.     A broader impact of this project is that it will address fundamental debates in the social sciences about the nature of democratic political processes. In particular, it will explore whether or not pro- and anti-environmental protests and organizations matter to legislative outcomes, net of the effects of party preferences, voting records, and partisan majorities in Congress. Moreover, because this project analyzes the impact of domestic and international social movement activity on the entire policy process, findings will have relevance to those interested in understanding the effects of global processes. Finally, by developing procedures for classifying bills with identical goals, the project will provide data for other researchers interested in capturing the histories of distinct policy proposals over time."

To a large extent, the performance engineering of network services (such as wireless service provision, content delivery, etc.)  is driven by the goal of mitigating negative externalities, such as congestion.  However, ultimately, the value of many such services is driven by a positive externality: the value that consumers derive by being able to connect with other users of the service.  In this research, models that help service providers evaluate the impact of positive externalities will be developed and analyzed.  Models from the single service provider viewpoint will be considered first.  Then the impact of positive externalities on firms in a competitive environment, noting that positive externalities create strong strategic complementarities between multiple service providers will be considered.    The models and insights this project intends to develop will have impact in networked service industries where positive externalities exist among consumers, including traditional network engineering, online gaming, Customer Relationship Management solutions, application service provision, etc.  These models will not only provide guidance in pricing service for the consumer, but also guidance in how to form contractual agreements with other service providers to exploit complementarities. To enhance this impact, industrial synergies enabled through the Media X program at Stanford will be exploited.  Also, the results developed here will be incorporated into graduate courses on revenue management and processing networks, as well as network economics."

Yet even the largest firms often lack the time and range of technical resources necessary to develop the best innovations, especially when the technologies are intertwined and the markets are fast-paced. Thus, effective technical collaboration across firms becomes essential. But such collaborations are not easy to achieve given the organizational challenges of working across firms (e.g., cultural differences, geographic distances, differences in incentives), and the strategic challenges of the fundamental tension between competition and cooperation that are inherent in collaborations. Yet despite their importance and significant challenges, there is little research into how technology collaborations among firms actually occur, why some work while others do not, and how they extend into novel products and new business creation. Our research addresses this gap.      The primary purpose of this project is to examine how organizations successfully create technical innovations using cross-firm collaborations, with an emphasis on routines and processes used for collaborating. Given the limited understanding of how cross-firm technology collaborations are managed, we examine eight comparative case studies of collaborations in depth. This approach is particularly useful for uncovering accurate and yet unexpected insights into complex phenomena.     The setting is the computing and communications industries (e.g., semiconductors, networking, software, and Internet security). These are large, dynamic industries that are central to national competitiveness. Also, given their convergent and interdependent nature, these industries are ones in which technical collaborations across firms (e.g., collaborations that combine mobile and microprocessor technologies) are often essential. The focus is on established firms. These firms possess sufficient size to engage in meaningful R&D and sufficient economic scale to influence the national economy.     The data include interviews with a range of participants in the collaborating firms, observations, and archival information from multiple sources. The study should yield a deeper understanding of technical collaborations and their effectiveness, and more broadly, of how these collaborations influence significant economic outcomes including creation of novel products and successful engagement in new and growing global markets."

The work is designed to test how well radiation stress theory explains flows over and through the complex topography of typical reef/lagoon complexes, as well as examine how outflow jets from reef lagoons interact with the wave-driven inflow over a reef and thus determines net exchange. The field observations will be conducted at a micro-tidal lagoon system on Moorea, over a range of wave conditions. In each experiment, an array of Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and wave/tide gauges will be deployed along a cross-reef transect to resolve the key terms in the cross-reef momentum balance, and obtain the best estimates to date of bottom stress over coral reefs. A second array will be deployed to measure mass fluxes through the lagoon and out the reef pass, to complete a water and exchange budget for the system. Finally, intensive shipboard profiles of the water column and drifter releases will be used to determine the fate of the pass jet and potential for re-entrainment to the reef, particularly in the presence of persistent alongshore flow. In parallel with the field program, a series of numerical experiments on idealized reef-lagoon-pass systems will be conducted, mapping the parameter space of dynamical balances. The numerical work will use the open source circulation model developed at Stanford University (3D, baroclinic, non-hydrostatic, unstructured grid, finite volume, parallel code) coupled to a wind-wave model. The proposed simulations looks at a class of nearshore flows that has received less attention than has similar flows on beaches and should reveal the extent to which the present model of the interaction of waves and mean flows works for a geometry that is different than that of a beach. The \"confrontation\" of model and observation may point the way to using new classes of wave models, or even highlight fundamental differences between theory and observation that have no present explanation. From the standpoint of shallow water dynamics, the role of waves in modifying the outflow from a small inlet is also novel.     Broader Impacts  The functioning of coral reefs, some of the most threatened and economically valuable marine ecosystems, are strongly dependent on hydrodynamics. The experiments and computations will significantly improve our understanding of coral reef hydrodynamics, and thus speed progress toward predictive models that could be used to set environmental policies, or in designing marine reserves based on knowledge of \"connectivity\". From an interdisciplinary standpoint, this research will provide biologists and geochemists working on reefs with means of understanding how remote forcing (swell) changes conditions for organisms of interest or for chemical reactions and transformations. The research team has a record of engaging and collaborating with other disciplines. The physical understanding of the system will greatly aid numerous LTER activities (e.g. zooplankton, fish ecology, nutrient dynamics, etc.) at the field site. The numerical circulation model will provide the essential foundation any future 3D physical biological modeling of this and similar systems. Investment in the Stanford model development will benefit the oceanographic community via our long-standing practice of sharing model source code with other users. In terms of education, this project will involve the training of 2 women PhD students (both NSF fellows), noting that females are underrepresented in physical oceanography. They will both learn about observational physical oceanography, scientific diving and high performance computing. The field work will also involve several other graduate and undergraduate students who will be exposed to and participate in interdisciplinary experiments, as well gaining experience with studies of complex coastal flows."

Although research on the properties of static networks is well-developed, researchers know very little about how social networks form, persist, and influence people over time.  Part of the difficulty in studying social network dynamics is a lack of suitable data, as it is difficult to follow network evolution in unbounded populations.  Schools provide an excellent context for studying network dynamics.  First, schools provide natural boundaries that focus network dynamics.  Second, relation content evolves developmentally as youths age, changing from local classmate relations among children to deeper friendship and romantic relations among young adults.  Finally, youths are directly concerned with network change, and they often respond to changes in others' network ties.  Here, the investigators weave together multiple studies of youth networks using data on hundreds of schools and thousands of students to build a composite portrait illustrating how long-term social networks develop from transitory face-to-face interactions.  To build this portrait, the researchers use new dynamic network tools allowing them to visualize network evolution directly.  Just as a cardiogram allows physicians to monitor the dynamics of heart functioning in response to stress, these \"network movies\" help researchers identify the social mechanisms responsible for network formation.  The investigators next develop new clustering techniques that identify groups and their stability over time. These clustering techniques reveal peer group life-histories, and it provides a key middle-range image of network change. Finally, they use a new class of models known as exponential random graph models (ERGM) to identify classes of social mechanisms affecting network formation and change. The highly interdependent nature of social networks has made them inappropriate for standard statistical modeling, but exponential random graph models address the kinds of interdependencies present in network data.  While standard features -- such as a preference to form relations with people similar to oneself (\"homophily\") -- are expected to be important, internal network features will be important as well.  These features account for how youths change their local networks in response to changes elsewhere in the network.  For example, how do other relations change when a member of one group becomes friends with members in another group?  Being able to explain how relationships form, what makes peer groups stable, and how popularity changes has direct influence on educators' and policy makers' ability to work with youth networks to help promote pro-social, healthy youth behavior."

This project is targeted at little understood but critical aspects of robot-supported collaborative work.     The research involves three kinds of studies: (1) fundamental laboratory research on behavioral characteristics of robots performing social tasks, especially as these characteristics reflect lifelikeness, (2) controlled experiments and field studies of interpersonal communication and the development of mutual understanding between robot and human, and (3) studies of robots in work groups. The studies are designed to motivate and test theory, as well as to explore both direct and secondary or indirect social effects of robot-supported collaborative work. The fieldwork will be carried out in hospitals and scientific exploration settings.

This approach models grammar as a highly plastic cognitive system sensitively tuned to the probabilities of the environment.  The project combines detailed statistical analyses of patterns found in recorded speech with laboratory experiments on language production in adults and language learning in children.  The phenomena considered include high-level grammatical choices (such as whether to say \"give someone a job\" or \"give a job to someone\"), low-level pronunciation choices (such as where \"to\" is reduced to \"tuh\"), and overregularizations (such as when children say \"goed\" instead of \"went\").

The research team undertaking this interdisciplinary project will combine the approaches of archaeology, demography, and agricultural ecology to study how a complex early state-level society arose in the isolated Hawaiian Islands prior to contact with Europeans. Hawai'i offers a 'model system' because the cultural and biological processes that developed and interacted in Hawai'i, from population growth and intensification of agriculture and resource extraction, to the increasing centralization of political power and economic control, have happened everywhere and indeed are taking place globally today - but the context in which they take place is better-defined in Hawai'i than elsewhere. The research team will integrate quantitative modeling (ecosystem, demographic, and agricultural production models) with carefully-focused field analyses of landscape biogeochemistry, agronomic systems, human demography in relation to agricultural infrastructure and productivity, household-scale archaeology, and the development of social and cultural complexity in societies based on both dryland and wetland (irrigated) modes of agricultural intensification.  The field research and landscape-scale ecosystem and demographic modeling will focus on the Kohala region of Hawai'i Island, which encapsulates the diversity of pre-contact production systems. Specifically, the project will: (1) Extend integrated analyses of dryland agricultural systems to the irrigated wetland agricultural systems that dominated the economies of windward landscapes of the older Hawaiian Islands.  (2) Analyze the dynamics of an agricultural population coupled to a nutrient-cycling model of agriculture, thereby illuminating the dynamics of agricultural populations subject to variable climate over a spatially heterogeneous habitat. (3) Investigate temporal changes in the domestic economy and production of surplus, to determine how changes at the household level were linked to the emergence of a regional-scale integrative political economy.  (4) Evaluate the consequences of different forms of social organization for population growth, stability, and well-being, and for resource surplus, shortage, and sharing.

This project focuses on the impacts of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on precipitation and temperature variability, and in turn on water management and crop production, in one of China's major rice bowls, Jiangxi Province. Jiangxi is also one of China's poorest provinces, where swings in crop production and prices can jeopardize rural incomes and food security. The project involves four integrated components: 1) the development of empirical downscaling models (EDMs) to quantify local climate patterns within Jiangxi province based on large-scale climate dynamics associated with ENSO; 2) the construction of a hydrological model for Jiangxi to estimate the relationship between local precipitation, reservoir levels and storage, and water management decision practices; 3) the use of regression models to analyze the effects of ENSO-induced climate variability on seasonal and annual rice production in Jiangxi; and 4) the development of a modeling framework to analyze the impacts of ENSO events on rice trade and prices within China and within the Asian rice economy. The development of an ENSO-trade model, which builds on earlier research funded by NSF on ENSO-rice relationships in Indonesia and the Philippines, provides an important intellectual contribution that will permit further analysis of ENSO impacts on agriculture and food security throughout Southeast and East Asia.  It also has practical policy implications for governments seeking to stabilize commodity prices under unstable climatic conditions.     A key contribution of the project is the creation of a new collaborative team of Chinese and American researchers whose work will enhance interdisciplinary educational opportunities in their home institutions, scholarly exchange between countries, and policy relevant science within China.  The research team includes atmospheric scientists, hydrologists, economists, remote sensing experts, and policy analysts. Undergraduate and graduate students from the U.S. and China will be brought into the study with funding from this grant and from existing academic funding sources within the home institutions. The project represents one of the inaugural activities for the Center for Global Forecasting within the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and it will lead to a set of policy briefs to the current Premiere of China (Wen Jiabao) and his rural policy team (headed by Chen Xiwen).  Beyond China, the methods and results of the research will be shared with the international science and policy communities through a set of organized public meetings within Southeast Asia, the publication of papers in leading climate, hydrology, and policy journals, and public talks at professional society meetings and smaller meetings related to future climate impacts. The results will also be disseminated through consultations with aid agencies (e.g., Asia Development Bank, USAID, the World Bank), the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (Extreme Climate Events Program), and private foundations that invest in agricultural technologies and programs to enhance food security (e.g., the McKnight Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Gates Foundation)."

As their economic importance grows along with their size and complexity, it becomes critical to ensure their operational health and robustness through continuous monitoring. With that motivation, this project develops lightweight monitoring algorithms and tools for sensor networks that allow the network operators to observe the large-scale behavior of the network and detect significant anomalies in network attributes or performance. The tools themselves are generic and can be composed to provide tailored solutions to meet various application-specific needs.    The design of these monitoring tools requires inferring global aspects of the network through local information available at individual nodes. In order to synthesize a global summary from local views in a lightweight, energy-efficient manner, the project employs three methods: (1) intelligent sampling, (2) information aggregation, and (3) sparse representation of the signal landscape. These methods utilize mathematical techniques from geometry, topology, statistics, and distributed signal processing.    The network monitoring tools enable better designed, more robust, trustworthy, and longer-lived sensor networks in operation. That, in turn lowers costs and enlarges the community of users as well as the set of potential commercial applications for networked sensing.    The research output of this project includes novel algorithms, software tools, and their empirical evaluation using testbeds."

The network architecture consists of optical grid and wireless mesh networks for broadband access. The optical grid network provides broadband and efficient backhauling, enabled by reconfigurable optical grid nodes and hierarchical loop routing algorithms, so that the backhauling network is highly adaptive to real time traffic demand. The wireless mesh network, which penetrates into users' neighborhood, is designed to facilitate cost-effective, ubiquitous links in the last/first hundreds of feet, and extend the wireless coverage without sacrificing system bandwidth. A hybrid optical/wireless routing algorithm is developed and a high-performance RF over fiber in sub-carrier multiplex optical channels is built to improve the system performance. A novel reconfigurable grid node technology is developed for flexible and efficient traffic routing in the optical grid network. The research effort includes routing algorithm design, device design and implementation, optical and wireless subsystem design, and hybrid network testbed implementation and performance evaluation.

This goal is to be achieved by requiring all traffic to explicitly signal its origin as well as intent to the network at the very outset.     Using this as a guiding principle, the principal investigators plan to develop tailor-made  security architectures for private networks (e.g., enterprises) which often enforce tight controls on who can communicate with whom, as well as for public servers (e.g., e-commerce sites) which are more \"open\" and desire to be globally visible. The proposed solution for private networks requires all network-wide policies to be specified at a single location called the domain controller. If the policy allows it, the domain controller grants explicit permission for users to communicate. In contrast, this solution for the public setting argues for modifications to end-host APIs to allow end-hosts to signal their intent to the wide-area Internet and to other public servers.    Broader Impact: The research will culminate in a prototype security architecture for private networks and a comprehensive blue-print of security mechanisms for public services. This approach in either case is radical, and represents a substantial intellectual departure from existing thinking."

To continue learning, people need to learn to self-assess their own progress and understanding. We are investigating the social basis of self-assessment for learning. Specifically, we hypothesize that, under identifiable conditions, assessing others can support self-assessments that promote content learning plus the ability to develop self-assessment strategies that can be applied in the future.  In this project, we take advantage of Teachable Agent technologies where students learn by teaching computer agents through the use of well-formed visual representations.  Teachable Agents, using simple artificial intelligence techniques, can then reason based on what they have been taught.  This creates optimal conditions for self-assessment, because students' assessments of their agents' performance is also an assessment of their own knowledge.  The work occurs in the context of teaching the key ecosystem concepts of interdependence and balance to middle school students.  Students will first create Teachable Agents that are linked to their curriculum on pond and river ecosystems, and use this learning experience to create a new Teachable Agent that can sustain multiple fish in a home aquarium system. Students will also use the Teachable Agents in a new homework model that leverages current trends in home computer use and connects learning in formal and informal settings; students log on, chat with one another, and their agents interact with another in an on-line virtual environment. Overall, the proposed project joins three important strands of research assisted by advanced technology tools: The learning of dynamic processes in science; the social basis of self-assessments for learning; and, the improvement of connections between formal and informal learning settings."

We propose fundamental hydrologic-science research to understand the functional links between coastal wetland vegetation and transport processes involving subsurface water, dissolved salt, and heat. We hope to test the hypothesis that a plant \"engineers\" a beneficial environment, in part by controlling local salinity and soil moisture in a positive feedback system. We propose to study a salt marsh in the Palo Alto Baylands where we can engage in a combination of intensive field monitoring, low-altitude high resolution thermal and visual remote-sensing, and quantitative analysis based on multi-scale simulation. Our investigation would include inherent matters of spatial and temporal variability. Three nested models spanning scales from a single plant to a vegetation patch to the larger salt-marsh system will aid in quantifying the physical controls on the marsh-plant system. Based on two years of original field data for calibration, our models would quantify fluxes of water, salt, and heat on multiple scales. These models will enable us to test hypothesis and identify key controls on wetland hydroecology and to evaluate potential environmental impacts.     This project will contribute to hydrologic science by providing data and multi-process models that will be broadly applicable to other salt-marsh environments. Potential contributions include understanding species-specific hydrologic response, which will improve understanding of physical controls on ecosystem function. Quantification of local gradients and their causes would provide insight into the role of near-surface hydrogeology in binding adjacent plant patches into a united ecologic community. Our salt-marsh system model can be used to explore scenarios related to restoration and environmental change. Our data and modeling results might improve quantification of near-shore submarine groundwater discharge. Outreach will be achieved via publications and presentations. The Baylands Nature Interpretive Center has agreed to provide us with a venue for public/private workshops on wetland hydroecology and the scientific basis for wetland restoration. Our proposed research cuts across disciplinary boundaries by contributing to the fields of coastal ecology and biogeochemistry by helping to better identify fluxes and hyporheic exchange of water, solute, and heat that are of interest to wetland and marine ecologists and biogeochemists. Our results are also of interest to those in the fields of landscape ecology, plant physiology, benthic zoology, near-shore marine ecology, and coastal engineering."

Although many more examples can be given, the above share the common characteristics that the relevant sensors are geographically dispersed and that the data itself is dynamically generated, often unstructured, highly variable, and possibly massive.  The goal of this project is to investigate the intrinsic computational complexity and to develop fundamental algorithms for geometric problems involving such distributed networked spatiotemporal data. Potential applications include analyzing environmental data for ecological forecasting (e.g., predicting bio-diversity), landslide or debris flow prediction over extended areas, mining data on trajectories of vehicles or people for traffic management, detecting similar shapes across geographically separated regions for security or asset tracking, and many others.    Traditional geometric algorithms assume that all data is centrally available and that random access to the data is efficient --- assumptions that are clearly violated in the distributed networked setting. A key component of the project is to develop geometric summaries that preserve the essential features and structure of the data and to study the fundamental trade-offs between the relevant parameters, including the size, accuracy, utility, stability, and computational complexity of these summaries.  The project builds upon the existing sophisticated techniques such as epsilon-nets and approximations, coresets, discrepancy theory, range searching, persistent homology, surface reconstruction and simplification, kinetic data structures, and others.

The idea is to switch attention from exchanging information to setting up cooperative action. This changes network communication into a new problem. For example, suppose one wishes to have each of m nodes perform a different task, where the distribution of tasks is uniform over the m! assignments. Node 1 is specified by nature to do task i, say. How much information must be sent to each of the nodes to achieve this distribution?    In general, how much information {Rij}, j = 1, 2..., m, must be conveyed to achieve a specified joint distribution p(y1; y2; :::; ym) at the nodes, given that the values at a certain subset of the nodes is specified? Once the set of all distributions achievable for a given description region {Rij} is found, rate distortion theory becomes a special case. Furthermore, the broadcast channel and all the other multiuser channels in network information theory can be revisited. Here we are interested, not in the number of bits that can be distributed over this network, but rather the set of all coordinated actions that can be achieved.    This should have applications in distributed task assignment in a computer, coherent transmission of relay information, cooperative communication, coordination of sensors in a sensor network, and cooperative behavior in a society. What does it take to generate cooperative behavior?    Intellectual merit of activity: The proposed work requires investigating the fundamentals of how joint distributions are created under constraints. This should be interesting as well as reasonably fundamental. It will provide guidance to the efficient creation of coordination in networks.    Broader impacts resulting from proposed activity: Understanding the generation of joint actions should have impact on communication, coordination of sensor networks, distributed computation, control systems and social networks."

The idealized view of fault coupling involving an interseismically locked section that ruptures in earthquakes, with aseismically creeping sections above and below the locked zone, is inconsistent with observations from a number of plate boundary faults. For example, the San Andreas fault is locked above about 15 km depth south of Parkfield, California, but north of Parkfield, the San Andreas is creeping at typically seismogenic depths. Kinematic slip inversions from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake and the 2003 Tokachi-oki, Japan earthquake show significant afterslip at typically seismogenic depths, along strike from the mainshocks. This research utilizes GPS data from these two earthquakes and the 2004 Parkfield, California earthquake to investigate the distribution of slip and frictional properties on faults. Numerical models of afterslip implementing laboratory derived rate-state friction laws are being developed and implemented in inversions of postseismic GPS time-series data for frictional parameters. The observations of aseismic slip at seismogenic depths raise important questions about frictional properties on the fault and along-strike variations of slip behavior. Faults within the seismogenic part of the crust are generally assumed to be steady-state velocity weakening. Yet, velocity weakening friction does not always lead to unstable slip and and velocity strengthening friction does not always lead to stable slip. This study investigates the conditions on the fault that allow for the spatial variations in slip behavior. High-rate GPS data recorded at 1 Hz following the Parkfield and Tokachi-oki earthquakes is being used to investigate the transition from dynamic slip during the earthquake to stable creep following the earthquake. The nature of the transition from unstable may provide further constraints on the frictional properties on the fault."

The radiometer was first installed at its present location during the austral summer of 1984-5 and has provided a record of ELF/VLF noise in the Antarctic that is unprecedented in its continuity and duration. In parallel with this system, identical ones are currently in operation at Sondrestromfjord, Greenland, and on the Stanford University campus.  These additional systems provide comparison data for the arctic and for mid-latitudes.    Since the predominant sources of ELF/VLF radio noise are thunderstorms occurring in the tropical regions, these three systems provide complementary views of the thunderstorm activity occurring in the tropics. The long-term statistics can then provide independent information about global change. The low background in the Arrival Heights record further allows the determination of Schumann resonances, quasi-standing waves that exist in the Earth's electromagnetic cavity (the space between the surface of the Earth and the Ionosphere). Temporal changes in these resonant frequencies can be related to variations in the characteristics of the ionosphere. Because of the great difficulty of making long-term observations, particularly at remote locations, the Arrival Heights measurements are increasing in scientific value as the radiometer continues in operation."

Protein interaction networks have emerged as a canonical way to represent functional associations between proteins in a cell. In such a network, proteins are nodes and edges connect proteins that physically interact, or more broadly participate in the same biological process. For the molecular biologist, protein interaction networks are an invaluable resource, as they can aid in functionally annotating hypothetical proteins that are connected to proteins of known functions, identifying new multiprotein complexes, and suggesting promising target proteins for experimentation. This project will computationally predict interaction networks that integrate all available functional genomics data sources, compare predicted networks across microbes to extract functional modules, and generate concrete experimental recommendations. It will develop novel methodology for inferring transcriptional cascades on a global level and aligning these cascades to find conserved regulons. In addition it will create tools for computer-guided experimental validation in Caulobacter crescentus, which will guide efforts in two experimental laboratories. The result will be an experimentally tested means of predicting protein interactions ? and hence biology ? directly from genome sequence. The team will develop a powerful and user-friendly web interface where protein interaction networks from all sequenced microbes will be browsed and compared across species. The resulting data will be downloadable in convenient formats, and the software will be available through the General Public Licence (GPL). The team will directly involve several undergraduate students in the research, through the CURIS undergraduate research program at the Computer Science department. Research will be conducted at the Clark Center, a new building that is part of the BioX initiative at Stanford University. The BioX initiative's goal is to foster cooperation across disciplines such as biology and computer science, and to educate a new generation of students that will be bilingual in the languages of both the biological and computational sciences."

Nonetheless, they support a diverse assemblage of seaweeds, which use flexibility to reduce the area they expose to flow and to assume streamlined shapes. The role of flexibility in the evolution of algal design has been difficult to demonstrate, however, because few seaweeds are fossilized. In contrast, coralline algae reinforce their cell walls with calcium carbonate, and therefore have an extensive fossil record. In three separate instances, corallines evolved \"joints,\" which gave flexibility to their otherwise rigid fronds. This thrice-evolved mechanical innovation has been highly successful, and present-day jointed corallines thrive in wave-swept environments. This project uses biomechanical theory to examine the basis for, and implications of, this apparently convergent evolutionary innovation. At the organismal level, experiments manipulating the stiffness of algal fronds will document the role flexibility plays in modulating wave forces. Engineering theory on optimal design will allow the determination of how closely these seaweeds approach optimality. At the tissue level, measurements of the mechanical properties of joints will reveal if the three coralline lineages have converged on a common set of material properties, and how these properties contribute to survival. Electron microscopy and a variety of chemical tests will explore the molecular structure of coralline cell walls and how these molecules are arranged to produce joints' unusual mechanical properties. Together, these measurements provide a unique look at how evolution affects mechanical design in the dynamic environment where sea meets shore.  	Laboratory techniques developed here will be used by graduate students and the PI to teach principles of ecology, evolution, and biomechanics to Stanford undergraduates and as part of an intensive graduate course, which to date has been attended by students from 13 countries. This grant spreads awareness and understanding of algae and evolutionary concepts by conducting field trips, labs, and open houses for K-12 students and the public."

These reactions govern all aspects of cellular processes, from the extraction of energy from food, to the building of structures needed for constructing cells and organs, to the exquisite control of these processes as an organism experiences different environments and stresses. This research aims to  contribute to the fundamental understanding of enzyme action via investigation of a highly tractable, model enzyme, bacterial ketosteroid isomerase. This enzyme has several features that will allow its study at unprecedented depth and breadth. Specifically, this research entails a finely crafted blend of structural, dynamic and biochemical studies. Furthermore, this enzyme is tractable for chemical synthesis so that changes at the level of individual amino acids can be introduced systematically and thoroughly, without the limitations of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Most broadly, a central unanswered question in enzyme mechanism is the role of the protein structure surrounding the active site where catalysis takes place, and this research will provide incisive tests of the properties of the enzyme environment.    Understanding how enzymes function is fundamental for understanding life itself.  Furthermore, the majority of drug targets are enzymes, so that a deeper fundamental understanding of the action of enzymes may allow researchers to better design potent inhibitors that can act as drugs for numerous disease states. A deep understanding of enzyme action may also provide the information needed to design new enzymes that  catalyze new and beneficial reactions that can be used in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.    The broader impact of this project involves the training of graduate students in rigorous, quantitative aspects of biological chemistry, a background that will allow these students to contribute in many ways in their individual careers, as teachers, in applied or fundamental research, and in evaluating policy from a scientific standpoint. Further, the basic nature of the research renders it possible for undergraduates to obtain meaningful research experiences. In particular there are plans to ensure the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in this research, an opportunity that may greatly help stimulate the inclusion of such students in the future in the scientific community."

The shoreline and coastal waters are highly valued natural resources providing society with food, revenue, and numerous ecosystem services. To maintain healthy coastal ecosystems and clean coastal waters for future generations under increasing anthropogenic pressures, we need to develop sound management practices and policies for coastal margins. The proposed work addresses this need by elucidating anthropogenic and environmental factors that control densities of FIB along the shoreline. The proposed research activities will benefit society as a whole by providing information that will allow for better management of human health risks at recreational beaches.  The integrated research and education plan presented in this CAREER proposal aims to provide the next generation of environmental engineers with skills to solve multi-disciplinary coastal water quality problems.  The students who participate in the proposed research/education activities will be environmental engineers trained in fundamentals with breadth in microbiology, coastal oceanography, policy, and law, and thus well educated to tackle complex coastal water quality problems. As environmental problems of the future will require well-versed multidisciplinary investigators, the students will be well prepared for a future in environmental problem solving.  The education plan focuses on coastal water quality as a theme and uses field projects and hands-on experiences as vehicles for learning. Middle and high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and high school teachers are targets for the education plan. Specific objectives include the implementation of a novel, interdisciplinary environmental engineering class to be co-taught with lawyers, and a service learning class to be taught with a local wastewater treatment plant as the community partner.  The PI will mentor under-represented high school students from East Palo Alto, create a 1-day module on water quality for Stanford0s Upward Bound program for under-privileged middle and high school students, and work with a high school teacher to develop field and lab projects for high school science classes."

Despite the theoretical importance of adverse selection and evidence of its existence in particular markets, little is known about its quantitative relevance, its relative importance compared to other selection mechanisms, and about the way it affects the operation of markets.  The broad aim of the research is to better understand these issues by developing models of consumer-demand and equilibrium firm-behavior in these markets.  Markets with adverse selection are \"special\" in that firms' profits depend on the identity of their customers.  Thus, not only do firms face the traditional price-quantity tradeoff, but also an additional price-quality tradeoff induced by selection.  When such markets are oligopolistic, as often is the case, their industrial organization is further complicated because price changes by one firm do not only affect the level of demand faced by its rivals, but also their demand quality.  Thus, firms may choose, for instance, to strategically affect their rivals' cost structure.      The research consists of two components.  Both rely on new and unique proprietary individual-level data sets.  The first focuses on demand-side analysis in insurance markets in an attempt to estimate efficiency costs resulting from adverse selection, with emphasis on the important role of multiple dimensions of heterogeneity.  Heterogeneity in both risk and preferences complicates the efficiency analysis and makes \"reduced-form\" relationship between choices and outcomes neither sufficient nor necessary for inference about market efficiency.  The first part of this component develops a more structural approach to estimate the efficiency cost in the semi-compulsory annuity market in the United Kingdom.  The second part applies similar ideas to new data on health insurance choices by Alcoa employees, in which a quasi-experiment allows to estimate the value of choice, and to identify heterogeneity along three dimensions, of health status, the extent of moral hazard, and risk aversion.  The second component focuses on supply-side and equilibrium analysis in a particular consumer credit market.  The various parts of this component estimate the value of information in such markets, the effect of centralization, and the interaction between better information and other strategies, such as second-degree price discrimination.  The analysis utilizes new and rich transaction-level data from a large chain of automobile dealerships, which bundles used car sales with car financing, specializing in the subprime (high risk) market.  Over the six year observation period, the company has gradually moved from an interview-based approach towards highly centralized pricing system, which relies on sophisticated credit-scoring and other means of risk-based pricing, thus providing a rare opportunity to estimate the effects of such policy changes within sample.    Broader Impact:  Due to the inefficiency caused by adverse selection, both insurance and consumer credit markets are highly regulated, and better understanding of these markets will lead to more efficient and directed intervention.  All components of the research have direct policy implications.  For example, the analysis of choice in the U.K. annuity market speaks to cost-benefit analysis of allowing more choice in defined-contribution social security, the Alcoa data sheds light on policies linked to the new Medicare prescription drug benefits, and the work on consumer credit markets addresses the consequences of states' usury laws and individual bankruptcy laws."

Such systems constitute an inseparable part of human lives today, and will be further integrated in the future over a wide range of complex applications such as information appliances, transportation, health, bio-medical, and finance.  The project is motivated by an imminent paradigm shift in hardware design resulting from the growing problem of hardware failures in future semiconductor process technologies.  The traditional hardware design paradigm assumes that semiconductor process technologies always produce perfect hardware that will never operate incorrectly during its lifetime.  Continuous push for smaller semiconductor process geometries  also called technology scaling which is the key to the success of the semiconductor industry is approaching a point where such a design paradigm will be infeasible due to fundamental limitations.  This project breaks this barrier by adopting the following principle: accept the fact that the underlying hardware will be imperfect, and develop technologies and tools for designing efficient, cost-effective, and failure-aware robust systems that ensure high quality of service, data integrity, availability, security and safety.  This advancement in Computer Engineering will enable the semiconductor industry to continue technology scaling with immense impact on future electronic products.  It is also expected that the research ideas developed in this project will have a far-reaching impact on robust designs in emerging revolutionary nanotechnologies far beyond contemporary CMOS technologies."

Perhaps most surprising about this policy debate is that it has not been informed by technical considerations: i.e., the technology and architecture of the Internet.  This CAREER project closes this gap, by ensuring that robust architectural design and economic sustainability are viewed as complementary features of a successful communications infrastructure.  We study the influence of technology and architecture on contracting models for the Internet, to determine those which will lead to an economically sustainable network.  Two high-level questions drive the majority of the research agenda: (1) What contracting models are \"incentive compatible\", i.e., align individual incentives with global network sustainability?  (2) What contracting models ensure the network eventually converges \"dynamically\" to a sustainable operating point?  We use these questions as the backdrop to first evaluate the shortcomings of the current Internet contracting system.  We then evaluate how a sequence of technological or architectural changes enable more sophisticated contracting models, ultimately suggesting a \"contracting protocol\" that enables value transmission over multiple timescales between nodes of the Internet.  A broad-based education and public outreach program complements the research endeavors.    Broader Impacts:    This project educates a new generation of leaders and the public at large about the role that technology and architecture play in the economic structure of the Internet.

The purpose of the proposed research is to develop predictive multi-scale models to describe the chemistry/transport interactions in DMFC anodes on a detailed level.    The single crystal electrode test fixture is innovative and works well with the proposed experimental approach.

However, the scope that the PI has defined is of sufficient breadth for a major advancement in multi-scale modeling that will influence future design.

The first set of projects examine gender differences and labor markets.  The PI examines how labor markets work and whether they work differently for women and men.  The PI builds and analyzes a new mathematical model of labor markets that focuses on the idea that someone is hired into a job when an employer 'matches' with an employee.  She uses this model to study practices that are adopted by some employers to deal with real world factors that limit the employer's ability to review a large number of individual job applications and applicants.  She also uses this model to gauge the possible efficiency gains from implementing specific affirmative action measures.    She also conducts economic experiments to measure the size and sources of gender differences in performance on common classroom and job tasks.  Her previous research suggests that gender differences in competitive attitudes may be part of the reason for these differences.  Her CAREER research includes going beyond these preliminary results to consider whether gender affects the choice of work tasks.  Her research also looks for underlying reasons why we observe gender differences in confidence even when both men and women receive ample feedback on task performance.    The educational component of the CAREER activities includes working with a wide variety of students and professional organizations to improve the job search process in STEM fields.    This research will help us to understand what kinds of institutions and practices can enhance how both men and women perform in classroom settings and in employment searches.

Transformations that previously were unknown or quite difficult not only may become feasible but will be performed with high atom economy. The use of two separate transition metal catalyzed reactions occurring in the presence of each other either concurrently or consecutively will also be examined. Thus, in one pot, combining up to four components can lead to important synthetic building blocks. The extraordinarily broad range of stable oxidation states of ruthenium may impart reactivity where it did previously exist. Use of allenes in place of alkynes in these reaction schemes opens the prospect of alkene/alkyne/aldehyde 3-component coupling cyclizations. Special attention will be paid to comparing and contrasting rhodium vs. ruthenium catalysis of [5+2] cycloadditions.

A new strategy involving a [3+2+1] multicomponent coupling to generate pyridines, an extremely important class of heterocycles found in many biologically important targets, will be examined. Catalytic redox isomerization will be developed as an atom economic way to adjust oxidation levels. Intercepting the intermediates in the process provides opportunities for rapid increase of molecular complexity by multicomponent coupling protocols.    With the support of this award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Barry Trost, of the Department of Chemistry at the Stanford University, is developing new methods to catalyze selective and efficient organic reactions. The need of increasingly complex organic molecules for a myriad of applications ranging from biology to material science heightens the need for increased sophistication in organic synthesis. Increasingly, it is no longer a question of whether a target can be synthesized, but rather how. Practical syntheses, whether total or partial, derive from the existence of the basic set of synthetic reactions. The limitations of that base set cripples our ability to broadly solve the problems of complex synthesis. The goal of this program is to enhance synthetic efficiency for the synthesis of complex molecules by increasing the basic set of synthetically useful reactions. Selectivity (chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-) has been the prevailing issue to date. Limitations of raw materials and environmental concerns require attention to an equally important but frequently overlooked issue - atom economy, i.e., the development of reactions in which, to the greatest extent possible, any stoichiometric by-products are minimized and, in the ideal case, eliminated so that the product is the sum of the reactants with any additional reagent being required only catalytically."

Each decade, some countries default on their debts, and periodically these episodes combine into full-blown international financial crises. Empirical work over the past 10 years has also demonstrated that costs of trading goods are large and important for explaining the pattern of bilateral trade. The goal of this project is to disentangle empirically the contribution of goods and asset-market frictions in explaining a set of puzzles in international macroeconomics.    The first step of the project develops a multi-country model where it is costly to ship goods across countries, and there may be limitations on the types of inter-temporal contracts that countries can write with each other. In this world, countries optimally choose not to smooth their consumption perfectly across goods, states of the world and over time, even if there are no restrictions on the inter-temporal contracts they can write. The second step of the project uses the model to develop and implement a new test for international consumption risk sharing using a sample of 80 countries. Preliminary results suggest that both costly trade and frictions in asset markets are necessary to explain the failure of perfect consumption insurance across countries.     The third step of the project investigates the nature of the salient limitations on the inter-temporal contracts countries can write with each other. The absence of an authority that enforces contracts between parties from different countries may reduce the set of feasible contracts to those that are self-enforcing. Many of the instruments used in international financial transactions do not make payments contingent on the circumstances in which the parties find themselves ex post. Different limitations on contracts have different implications for the evolution of the cross-country distribution of wealth. The model developed in the first stage of the project provides a method for estimating the international wealth distribution, and hence testing these implications.     The propensity of agents to hold portfolios that are strongly tilted towards domestic assets has been called a puzzle. Given the results from the analysis of the most appropriate way of modeling frictions in international asset markets, the fourth step of the project will explore the degree to which country portfolios are consistent with the evidence on the nature and size of trade costs and frictions in asset markets. The final step of the project addresses the contribution of trade costs and asset market frictions to the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle.     The results of this project contribute to our understanding of the quantitative importance of goods versus financial market frictions in impeding international market integration. Given the goods market frictions and asset market structure preferred by the data, it is possible to analyze the welfare benefits of policies designed to ameliorate these frictions. This helps in the design of government policy that has the aim of further integrating markets internationally, thereby giving this research broader impacts."

Who a person knows affects their behavior and well-being in many ways including which jobs they find, which products they buy, what their political opinions are, and even whether or not they engage in criminal activities, among many other things.  It is also well-documented that there is a strong tendency for people to interact with other people who are similar to themselves.  This is known as ''homophily'' and has been documented in terms of ethnicity, gender, political affiliation, age, religion, profession, and a variety of other socio-economic categories.  Moreover, there is evidence that interaction patterns differ depending on group size (e.g., minority groups are more likely to interact with each other).  This project develops models that provide theoretical predictions concerning social network formation in the presence of a diversity of types of individuals, as well as modeling the diffusion of behavior on networks that exhibit segregation.     A first part of this research develops models of how friendships and other relationships form in a world where individuals are of distinct types and have higher values of interacting with their own types.  The theory is based on a variation of a ''search'' model, where individuals randomly meet each other and then choose whether or not to form a relationship, or whether to continue to search.  More populous types find it relatively easier to meet each other, and this affects the tendency of different groups to form inter-group friendships.   This stark model provides a rich set of predicted behaviors.  It offers new insights into the level of integration of a population and how inter-group ties depend on population sizes.      A second part of this research develops predictions of behavior in settings where heterogeneous individuals are interconnected, but with some level of segregation.  This extends existing models of contagion as well as the diffusion of behavior (adoption of technologies, information transmission, etc.) to situations where the network of interactions exhibits some level of segregation.  This provides a deeper understanding of when and to what extent behavior differs across partly segregated groups and how this depends on their population size and social structures.  It deepens the understanding of how the segregation level of a network affects the initial thresholds for the diffusion of behavior, as well as overall eventual adoption rates in a population.      A third part of the research bridges these first two parts, where the decisions with whom to interact depend not only on an individual's type, but also on their anticipated behavior.      The broader impact of the project involves providing models that serve as a basis for empirical research on social structure, segregation, and the diffusion of various economic behaviors.  It also provides new insight into the understanding of ''diversity'' and integration, and helps in developing policies aimed at improving social welfare."

How do political-economy constraints affect international financial markets? Why do countries default and when should they? These are among the most basic and important questions in International Finance, affecting policy makers, international financial institutions, supra-national institutions and entire countries. However, economists do not have convincing answers to any of these questions, and hence important issues like the welfare effects of reforms to the international financial system cannot be analyzed. The current project develops and tests a tractable model of sovereign debt repayment that provides answers to several of these questions. The model generates a novel set of empirical predictions, and it can be used for welfare analysis.     The first part of the project shows that the same economic forces that generate overspending in a political-economy model, can guarantee that a small open economy repays its sovereign obligations, even in the absence of direct sanctions. This model endogenously generates a non-trivial borrowing limit and ties the debt capacity of a country to several empirically relevant variables, such as the size of the shocks faced by the domestic economy, the number of political parties or regions, the discount rate of the domestic agents, and the international interest rate. The model provides several novel empirical predictions relating to the political system, domestic institutions and the amount of borrowing in an economy.     The project generates an explicit model of savings by a group of agents that interact repeatedly. Hence, the applicability of the basic model extends beyond the particular case in focus: that of countries participating in the international financial market. For example, the model could be useful in explaining household savings behavior, public good provisions, and resource extraction problems, thereby giving it broader impacts.    Once the model has been solved, comparative-static results can be generated and the implied empirical predictions tested. Finally, the model can be used to study the welfare effects of changes in the international financial system and in certain domestic institutions that are relevant for access to that system.     This project aims to answer the questions of what keeps countries from defaulting on their external obligations. The modern quantitative literature has so far by-passed this question and  assumed the existence of an exogenous cost of defaulting. However, the nature of this exogenous cost has been difficult to identify and quantify empirically.  By introducing political economy considerations into a fairly standard model, this project develops a rich set up where debt is repaid in equilibrium and where the particular form of punishment after default is the one that has been prevalent among all defaults: countries when defaulting are excluded from borrowing again."

The theoretical portion of the project aims to integrate multi-item auction theory, particularly the theory of package auctions, with matching theory to develop practical means to solve harder resource allocation problems than is allowed by current mechanisms.  In package auctions, participants bid for bundles consisting of multiple items. For example, the city of London uses a package auction to select bus companies to service combinations of bus routes.     Intellectual Merit: Auction theory and matching theory both have a long intellectual history dating to the early 1960s. Seminal contributions by William Vickrey in auction theory and by Gale and Shapley in matching theory laid much of the foundations for current thinking. The Gale-Shapley algorithm has served as a basis for several high-profile applications in recent years, including the match of doctors to hospital residency programs and the assignment of children to schools in New York and Boston, but the generalized Vickrey auction for heterogeneous goods appears never to have been applied. Its failure arises from certain limitations of the auction, especially its potential to yield very low revenues and its manipulability not to reported values but to shill bidders, coalitions, and sellers who may have an incentive disqualify some buyers. The theory will develop alternative designs that maintain as many of the desirable features of Vickrey auctions as possible while ensuring adequate revenues and immunity to the other identified manipulations. The experiments will test the practicality of related dynamic mechanisms, which are reported to have been used with great success in certain laboratory settings but which have not been systematically analyzed.     Broader Impacts: Auctions with package bidding have the potential to result in dramatic improvements in resource allocations and increases in revenues compared to traditional designs in many high-value settings. In the context of asset sales, package auctions have the advantage of attracting bids by bidders interested in either large or small packages, which is an especially important advantage when each set of bidders is small and neither alone would be enough to generate sufficiently competitive prices. In these settings, theory and experiment both indicate that these auctions can achieve efficiency when more traditional kinds of auctions cannot."

While it is generally believed that the source of the energy is magnetic reconnection, the origin of these high energy particles is a matter of considerable debate. Based on new observations (notably high resolution data from RHESSI), the PIs have proposed that most of the energy released is initially converted into plasma turbulence, which then accelerates particles and heats the plasma further. This team thus plans to investigate the role of anisotropic turbulence cascade and damping in the acceleration of solar plasmas. They plan to use accurate dispersion relations that go beyond simple MHD treatments in their evaluation of wave-wave and wave-particle interactions. Their goal is to incorporate these results into a solar flare model to present a self-consistent picture of flares that can be tested by observations.     The Stanford PI and his associates have developed numerical codes to study particle heating, acceleration, transport, and radiation. The Wisconsin Co-PI and his group have substantial expertise in the area of magnetic plasma turbulence and have developed codes for treating turbulence in the regimes relevant to the study. Recent work by the PI and his associates has shown that turbulence can explain many features of the new observations. They expect turbulence to be present in flare plasmas and their simulations confirm this. The Co-PI has also made progress in the understanding of compressible MHD turbulence. This Stanford-Wisconsin team thus believes that incorporating the physics of turbulence generation and evolution, and its coupling with solar plasma, will now permit advances in solar flare modeling. The complementary expertise of the Stanford and Wisconsin PIs could provide the tools necessary for a breakthrough in this important problem.     This research is expected to have a strong educational aspect by involving not only postdoctoral fellows and graduate students at both institutions, but also undergraduate students. The results of this research will be presented at local educational and public institutions through the auspices of Stanford's Haas Center for Public Service."

K. Hanson, Stanford University  Public Abstract  Hydrogen/oxygen oxidation is one of the most important systems in combustion today.  This has led to the development of an extremely accurate description of H2/O2 chemistry at high temperatures (above 1200 K).  However, at intermediate temperatures (from about 800 to 1200 K) the rate coefficients of many important chemical reactions are uncertain, particularly those involving HO2, the hydroperoxyl radical, and H2O2, hydrogen peroxide.  H2O2 kinetics can dominate the chemistry in hydrogen-powered engines, such as homogenous charge compression ignition engines (HCCI), and are critical to describing engine knock and diesel ignition.  An understanding of H2O2 chemistry is also needed as a basis for attacking the larger problem of peroxy-radical (RO2) chemistry important in oxidation at intermediate temperatures of hydrocarbons.  New measurements with smaller uncertainties of the rate coefficients in the H2O2 system at intermediate temperatures are urgently needed to improve chemical models and computer simulations of these processes.  Alkanes are important components of all hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel.  During combustion, these alkanes (such as n-heptane and iso-octane) decompose into alkyl radicals.  Subsequently these alkyl radicals are either oxidized or further decompose. These two alkyl pathways of oxidation and decomposition, and their relative rates, dictate the subsequent behavior of the combustion system.  The properties of these reactions cause a change in the oxidation mechanism in the intermediate temperature regime which results in the \"negative temperature coefficient\" (NTC) behavior in hydrocarbon oxidation.  Complete understanding of the alkyl oxidation mechanism has implications in combustion chemistry, auto-ignition, engine knock, atmospheric chemistry and radical reaction chemistry.  Quantitative measurements of transient radicals, including OH, HO2 and alkyl-peroxy-radicals, will be made in these systems using UV laser absorption in shock tubes. From these measurements of time histories for species concentrations, reaction rates will be determined for several critical hydrocarbon combustion reactions.  Specific reactions of interest include: H2O2  OH + OH; H + H2O2  HO2 + H2;  C2H5 +O2  HO2 + C2H4; C3H7 +O2  HO2 + C3H6.  These reactions have been identified as major contributors to the uncertainty in the modeling of intermediate temperature (800-1200 K) combustion. Key contributions will be the measurements themselves, falling in a key temperature region and measured at pressures from 1 to 100 atm, and a new 215nm deep-UV laser-absorption diagnostic method.  This research will provide an opportunity to train a generation of engineering scientists in modern combustion kinetics and state-of-the-art laser diagnostic and shock tube techniques.  Public dissemination of this data through the web using current databases will provide the public, students, teachers and government workers with the information needed to critically understand combustion processes.  With one of the important problems facing Americans today being generation of greenhouse gases from combustion processes and the subsequent effect of global warming, research on combustion fundamentals is critically needed."

The group is also initiating a new analysis effort involving D mixing and will conduct the final time-dependent Dalitz-plot analysis of B -> rho pi on the complete data sample, to extract the CKM angle alpha.   The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is the first ground-based telescope being designed from scratch to address the severe demands on systematic uncertainties needed to fully exploit weak gravitational lensing as a cosmological probe. The LSST will also address cosmological questions through studies of the growth of large scale structure, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae.  The Stanford group is joining the LSST project collaboration and will contribute to areas that benefit from the experience of particle physicists and aid in the understanding and reduction of potential systematic uncertainties: the development of a detailed simulation, the study of algorithms with existing data sets, and the design and construction of calibration systems.  The broader impacts of the program have several foci.  The PI will continue her efforts to integrate experimental particle physicists into the LSST project through tutorials and workshops.

This technique has the promise of drastically reducing radioactive backgrounds, providing a clean and un-ambiguous measurement with unprecedented sensitivity. In the last few years, EXO R&D has been equally divided between the construction of a 200 kg intermediate scale detector (EXO-200) without Ba tagging and the development of the Ba tagging system. EXO-200 construction is now nearing completion.     The work proposed here concentrates on Ba extraction from the liquid xenon (LXe) and identification. Some new ideas, presented here, have the potential of providing the key for the design of the full scale EXO experiment. Previous R&D has resulted in an ion trap capable of clear single Ba ion detection in the presence of a cooling gas, and the initial experimentation with a number of Ba transfer techniques. The R&D proposed here will revolve around three parallel themes, each to be developed by one of the three collaborating institutions. The conclusion of EXO Ba tagging R&D, along with the successful operation of the EXO-200 detector, will result in the design of a formidable next generation double beta detector to be sited at an underground laboratory in the near future.     The techniques to be developed in this project span a broad range of topics, from nuclear and particle astrophysics, to AMO, surface physics and material science. This research, if successful, is likely to be applicable to other problems in science and technology, where the high efficiency transfer and identification of single atoms would be of interest.

The emergent structures serve to both suggest natural generalizations---often with applications to analytic number theory---and point towards unexpected connections with such diverse areas of mathematics as the spectral theory of automorphic forms, arithmetic of function fields, the geometry of affine root systems and combinatorial representation theory. Many applications in analytic number theory have been found and many more are expected. These include moment estimates and convexity breaking for L-functions over an arbitrary number field, nonvanishing results for L-functions over number fields and function fields and results on the nature of the mysterious Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series and higher order theta functions. Moreover, during the past several years the combined efforts of the investigators have demonstrated that Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series have a beautiful structure that was previously unknown, and by elucidating this structure, new connections with other areas of mathematics are rapidly emerging. The grant will fund continued investigation of these rapidly developing areas. In addition, two workshops are planned for the dissemination of these results and new techniques to research mathematicians and graduate students.      Number theory began thousands of years ago and was initially inspired by questions about prime numbers. Dirichlet series are infinite series, such as the Riemann zeta function, and are a primary tool in the study of prime numbers. More recently they have come to fore by providing interconnections between many diverse areas of pure mathematics and physics.  Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms."

Kahn  Stanford University  Exploiting Spatial Dimensions in Multimode Fiber Using Adaptive Optical Signal Processing      Intellectual Merit:    Multimode fiber (MMF) is subject to modal dispersion that limits bit rates and transmission distances.  Research on single-mode fiber (SMF) has far outstripped work on MMF, so our understanding of propagation and dispersion is much more advanced for SMF than for MMF.  Adaptive signal processing is essential in wireless and wired communication systems, yet its potential has barely been explored in optical communication systems.  Researchers at Stanford University will exploit concepts developed for SMF to advance understanding of propagation and dispersion in MMF.  They will use adaptive optical signal processing to enhance transmission capacity in MMF.  The research will integrate analysis, simulation and experiment in three major thrusts:  (i) developing a fundamental understanding of multimode propagation and modal dispersion; (ii) mitigation of modal dispersion in single-channel systems; and (iii) mitigation of modal dispersion in multi-channel systems.  Analysis and experiment will address fundamental and practical limits to wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in mode-division multiplexing (MDM).  MDM and other multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) transmission schemes have yet to realize their potential.  Analysis and simulation will address MDM, particularly how to implement modal multiplexers and demultiplexers, which must be adaptive.    Broader Impact:  This project will enable significant increases in transmission capacity on new and previously installed multimode fiber infrastructure, benefiting research, education, healthcare, commerce, and homeland security.  New applications of multimode fibers and waveguides may be inspired, complementing single-mode media.  Research experience will be provided for graduate students.  The principal investigator will continue his commitment to educating students from diverse backgrounds, and to training of future educators.  He will also continue to integrate research closely with course work.  He will continue to emphasize timely dissemination of results in journals and conferences."

At the hardware level, the system will combine two novel features: support for dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) and support for isolated execution. DIFT allows the system to track the propagation of untrusted data and code during the execution of a program and prevent any unsafe uses. The goal is to develop hardware support for DIFT that reduces its overhead while allowing software to control and extend its policies. Isolated execution has been used to improve the performance by allowing optimistic parallelization. The goal is to extend isolated execution to support the use of untrusted data and code until their safety is verified. At the software level, the system will provide a runtime environment that will manage and virtualize the hardware security features based on the active security policies. It will also define the interfaces that allow software security tools (static and dynamic) to program, use, and collaborate with the hardware mechanisms. Finally, it will define a domain-specific language for security policies that abstracts out the division of labor between hardware and software security features. To demonstrate this approach, the project will develop a full-system prototype based on an open-source Sparc processor and the open-source Linux operating system. Such a prototype will facilitate an extensive security evaluation using real-world server and client software in an on-line setting."

Zacheus Cande (University of California, Berkeley; subawardee)    Senior Personnel:  Lisa Harper (University of California, Berkeley/USDA-ARS)    As complex organisms develop, the body plan is established first, followed by the specification of organs, then their constituent tissues, and finally the functional cell types are designated.  The regulation of cell fate acquisition occurs at many levels and is reflected in the gene expression and protein content within the cells and includes responses to external information such as hormones provided by surrounding tissues.  Despite the importance of cell fate to final function, this process is difficult to study in complex tissues with many cell types and because the process is occurring asynchronously in many tissues.  This project will exploit the five major cell types and their synchronous development within anthers to dissect cell fate in maize.  Gene expression and protein changes that distinguish cells from their neighbors with a different fate will be defined.  Mutants defective in cell fate acquisition at specific stages of anther development will be recovered by screening large collections of male-sterile mutants of maize established by prior work.  The normal progression of cell fate acquisition will be elucidated by comparing cell expression patterns of normal to mutant anthers.  Selected mutants will be described cytologically and by their pattern of gene expression.  Finally, genes defining key mutant stages will be cloned to determine the nature of the gene product essential for normal cell fate acquisition.  Data generated in the course of this project including microarray data and cytological descriptions of mutants will be made available through GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and through MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org). Biological resources will be available through the project and through the Maize Genetics Cooperation - Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu).   	    The lack of synchrony in pre-meiotic cells in most plants and animals has precluded deep analysis of the steps required for this particular fate decision.  Consequently, new knowledge and insights from this project will illuminate steps in cell fate specification for the meiotic cells and surrounding somatic cells that will be of general significance in understanding both complex plant and animal development.  To acquaint undergraduate students of agriculture focus with modern methods in plant genetics, the gene-tagging component of the project will be conducted at CalPoly-San Luis Obispo. Project senior personnel will acquaint students with the theory of transposon tagging in plants, and then train students to screen for male-sterile mutants in the field, to conduct genetic crosses for propagating mutants, to conduct allelism tests with previously identified mutants conferring similar phenotypes, to dissect anthers for analysis of gene expression, and to prepare DNA samples for the cloning of newly tagged mutant alleles."

Such multi-core or many-core chip multi-processor (CMP) architectures depend on an OCN to provide communication between processors, cache memory modules, and external memories and I/O devices.  A large fraction of area and power in such systems is consumed by communication  making OCNs even more critical.    The PIs propose to develop enabling technology (circuits and architecture) for OCNs. They will develop circuits that are expected to reduce OCN power by 10x and decrease cost by 4x for an OCN with constant performance. This circuit-level work will enable the development of accurate models for the cost, power, and performance for key OCN components. Using these models, new network architectures will be developed that are expected to close much of the gap between an OCN and the ideal interconnect to 1/3 of its present size. The technology developed will be demonstrated through implementing an optimized OCN to the level of completed layout. While the OCN will be targeted for CMPs and driven by CMP workloads through the RAMP infrastructure, the PIs will also be working with systems-on-chip groups to inject the proposed circuit macros and architectural designs into their design tool-chains."

Clock speeds are not likely to increase quickly in the future, and thus future performance gains will come primarily from exploiting the concurrency available in multi-core architectures.    However, it is well-understood that our software infrastructure is not ready for this revolution, because concurrent programming remains much more difficult than sequential programming.  In practice one of the biggest differences with sequential programming and a source of many serious problems is concurrency bugs.  Concurrent programs today are riddled with race conditions and deadlocks.

A superfluid will flow with no friction.  In that way it is similar to a superconductor, which carried an electric current with no resistance.  Therefore understanding superfluid helium can provide insight into superconductors. This research project will study how impurities modify the class of ordered states that include the high temperature superconductors, using superfluid 3He (one type of helium) as a model system.  Prior studies of superfluidity in liquid 3He contained within very low density silica aerogels (a very low density, highly porous material), which act as the impurities, found that the ordered state of the superfluid near its transition temperature was changed by the impurities, in a manner that was independent of the density of the impurities.  The present research project will extend the range of density of the aerogel (impurities) to see how low the density can be and still modify the 3He ordered state; and to see if other ordered states can be stabilized over different ranges of impurity densities.  Longitudinal magnetic resonance studies of the ordered state will be carried out to identify the microscopic nature of the state stabilized by the aerogel. The studies will also be carried out with different degrees of strain applied to the aerogel, to see how the affect of the aerogel 'impurities' depends upon anisotropy.  This project will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and the PI gives numerous technical and public lectures as a Nobel Laureate.    *****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT*****:  This award supports a study of how impurity scattering in unconventional BCS states can affect the identity of the ordered state, using superfluidity in 3He as a model system, and low density silica aerogels as model impurities.  Prior work has shown that aerogels with densities (fractional volume occupied by the aerogel) as low as 0.5% can stabilize a state near Tc that is not stable in the bulk, and that this new state is unchanged over a factor of two in variation in the aerogel density.  The present research will extend the range of aerogel densities to 0.2%, and will include longitudinal resonance studies in the new state to help determine its microscopic identity.  The application of variable longitudinal strain will help determine if the affects of the aerogel depend upon its anisotropy.  Separately, the 3He A to B transition is a valuable model for studies of first order phase nucleation.  A study of the A to B transition will be carried out to better understand the role of surface roughness in nucleation and to differentiate between the two proposed nucleation mechanisms involving nucleation by ionizing radiation.  This work will involve the training of both undergraduate and graduate research students."

These materials comprise strongly coupled pairs of spins (dimers) which by virtue of the crystal structure only weakly interact with each other. For antiferromagnetic intradimer exchange the ground state is a product of singlets, but strong magnetic fields can close the spin gap to excited triplet states which are delocalized as a consequence of interdimer coupling. These systems provide an elegant realization of a lattice gas of hardcore bosons, in which the external magnetic field plays the role of the chemical potential and the interdimer interactions determine both the kinetic and potential energy of the delocalized triplets. Depending on the balance of the interdimer couplings the triplets either crystallize or condense at low temperatures, leading to qualitatively different magnetically ordered states. Despite considerable theoretical interest in these magnetic states, there are relatively few candidate materials. The aim of this new research program is to develop novel spin dimer compounds, the study of which will deepen our understanding of the magnetically ordered states of this unusual class of materials. Experiments performed both in the PIs laboratory and at national facilities probe the magnetic properties via both thermodynamic and scattering measurements. Materials developed as part of this program will be available to the broader US condensed matter community via collaboration.

Non-technical:  The search for and discovery of new materials plays a vital role in the field of condensed matter physics and in the development of advanced technologies. This award funds a program that is focused on the development of new materials with novel magnetic properties. The study of magnetism and magnetic materials dates back to antiquity, but many fundamental questions remain unanswered about the ways in which atomic magnetic moments arrange themselves (i.e. order) with respect to each other at low temperatures. The scientific goal of this program is to understand the magnetically ordered states of spin dimer compounds, a novel class of magnetic material which provides some unique perspectives on magnetism and magnetic structures. Despite considerable theoretical interest in this area, and some natural advantages of these systems for studying specific aspects of magnetically ordered structures, there are relatively few candidate materials. The emphasis of this award is on the synthesis and characterization of new examples of spin dimer compounds.

In order to significantly improve device performance, single crystals and single crystalline films are being provided to produce large arrays of single crystal devices for practical applications. Although technologically challenging, the realization of large arrays of single crystal devices will lead to dramatic performance improvement of organic semiconductor based devices.

A classical approach to dealing with multiplicity is to require that decision rules control the familywise error rate.  But, when the number of tests is large, this measure is so stringent that alternative hypotheses have little chance of being detected.  Thus, alternative measures of error control are studied both in finite sample and asymptotically. Such measures include: the false discovery rate; the probability of k or more false rejections; tail probabilities of the false discovery proportion.  In order to develop methods which do not rely on unrealistic or unverifiable model assumptions, the investigator makes extensive use of computer-intensive methods.  The power of resampling is that the joint dependence structure of the individual tests can be captured so that methods need not be overly conservative.  The pursuit of such methodology is investigated from theoretical, computational and theoretical points of view, with special emphasis on a large number of tests.    The goal of this research is to develop new theory and methods for problems of multiple inference.  Virtually any scientific experiment sets out to answer questions about the process under investigation, which often can be translated formally into a set of hypotheses to be tested.  It is the exception that only a single hypothesis or question is under study.  In the \"information age\", the statistician is faced with the challenge of accounting for all possible errors resulting from a complex data analysis, so that any interesting conclusions can reliably be viewed as real structure rather than the result of \"data snooping\", i.e. finding artifacts of random data.  For example, current methods in biotechnology and genomics generate DNA microarray experiments, where gene expression level  in cells for thousands of genes are analyzed simultaneously on a gene by gene basis.  The goal then is to devise new techniques that are not based on strong assumptions that effectively deal with problems of multiplicity in the face of vast amounts of data.  The resulting inferential tools can be applied to such diverse fields as genetics, econometrics, finance, brain imaging, clinical trials, education and astronomy."

This is a natural generalization of the method of characteristics (used for inviscid problems) to viscous problems by adding noise to particle trajectories and averaging. The main focus of this research is to apply these techniques to the Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations. The Navier-Stokes equations can be elegantly formulated in the above framework using the inviscid Webber formula, which essentially represents the Navier-Stokes equations as the average of the Euler equations plus Brownian motion. We have a wide variety of applications in mind: A numerical (stochastic) method to compute solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, a study of the effect of obstacles and boundaries on viscous fluid flows, turbulence models for incompressible fluids, analytical estimates and weak solutions, and front propagation in the Boussinesq equations.    This research is based on the framework in which a viscous incompressible fluid can be explicitly represented as the average of an inviscid fluid plus Brownian motion. A study of several aspects of fluid dynamics in this framework is proposed. One important application is the implementation of a numerical method to compute fluid flows in turbulent settings (for instance air flow around an airplane wing, or in a jet engine). A related application is to use this method to find a \"turbulence model\" for fluid flows: namely, the velocity field of the fluid is expressed as a slowly varying \"mean field\" (which is easy and inexpensive to compute), plus a rapid fluctuating \"noisy\" part, which is modeled using stochastic methods. Another application is to study boundary layer effects on the interior flow in the inviscid limit. A study of burning and flame propagation is also proposed."

Success of inversion typically hinges on the practicality of solving wave or hyperbolic equations, or proper approximations thereof, on a massive computational scale. To this end, the PIs propose to revisit computational wave propagation in smooth media, in two and three space dimensions, in order to bring the complexity down to asymptotically linear in the size of the initial data, up to log factors and reasonable constants. In this low-complexity regime, precomputations involving the Green's function become the main focus of the numerical effort. To this end, the PIs propose to design, implement, test and analyze the following numerical methods: (1) an efficient algorithm for Fourier Integral Operators (FIO), using techniques such as phase-space partitionings, geometric downsamplings, directional interpolation, and low rank matrix approximations via random sampling, (2) an efficient algorithm for linear hyperbolic PDE with smooth coefficients, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also using techniques such as the phase-flow method for travel times, separation and random samplings of pseudodifferential symbols, and special  quadratures that exploit the microlocal geometry of wave propagation, and (3) an efficient algorithm for Kirchhoff migration in seismic imaging, based on the above algorithm for FIO, and also on a high-dimensional compression technique for the kinematics of the imaging operator. In a separate effort, the PIs will explore more general situations of physical interest such as phase blowups and multipathing, for which new ideas will be required.    The proposed research is directly motivated by the need for new, efficient inversion methods in reflection seismology. In turn, improved seismic imaging techniques (1) could help discover new physics and settle existing debates in geophysics (for instance concerning convection phenomena in the Earth's mantle), and (2) could provide a better map of the Earth's upper crust, for industrial exploration purposes. The PIs plan on working closely with seismologists in the later phases of the project, to deliver operational codes and disseminate ideas in the geophysics community. Alternatively, transmission electron microscopy is another curvilinear tomography imaging problem for which the proposed algorithms will provide a fresh outlook towards novel, accurate inversion methods, with applications in biology and medical imaging."

Probes that can produce a highly-localized potential perturbation are needed to apply scanning gate microscopy to semiconductor nanostructures. The proposed probes consist of cantilevers with integrated coaxial tips to generate a confined dipolar electric field at the underlying sample. Deflection of the cantilever resulting from tip-surface interactions will be detected by modulation of a piezoresistor located at the root. Initially, the probe will be used to map the probability densities of electrons in quantum dots and other semiconductor nanostructures, which to-date is a highly-desirable but unrealized goal.     Intellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit includes fundamental understanding of electron organization in semiconductor nanostructures, explaining properties of these low-dimensional systems, and designing novel devices (spintronic, single-electron, etc.) exploiting these properties. Beyond scanning gate microscopy, applications include the investigation of biological specimens, failure analysis of integrated circuits, and the study of noise in semiconductor devices. The coaxial tip may also improve the resolution and contrast of scanning electrochemical microscopy and scanning near-field microscopy.

No existing solver achieves all these goals, despite the fact that significant progress in relevant research areas has been made during the last few years. To achieve this goal, two major objectives may be identified. Firstly, the development of the high-order Spectral Difference (SD) Method for unstructured grids will be addressed. More specifically, the scheme will be extended to three dimensions, and formulated for mixed-element grids. The latter is necessary for efficient resolution of flows at high Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, upon analyzing and validating viable viscous discretization techniques, the scheme will be extended by the principal investigator and his colleagues to the Navier-Stokes equations on mixed grids. The second major objective is to improve the efficiency and robustness of the high-order methodology.  Numerical schemes of third or higher spatial order are not yet efficient enough for many problems of practical engineering interest, in particular high-speed viscous flow. To keep the number of degrees of freedom comparable to that of a second order method, the number of grid cells must be reduced as the order is increased. To resolve discontinuities sharply without oscillations h-p adaptively will be introduced. For both steady-state and time- dependent problems a fast solution technique is necessary to solve the arising systems of nonlinear equations. In order to meet this goal, an h-p multigrid strategy will be combined with efficient time stepping and relaxation schemes for both steady and unsteady flows.    Computational simulation has revolutionized the engineering design process and is by now the single most important tool in a wide range of high technology industries.  That in turn has had a huge impact in many real life applications of great importance to society and science, from aerospace to health to the environment.      The proposed research is targeted at advancing the state of the art of numerical algorithms which will be needed for the U.S. to remain at the forefront of computational simulation for both industrial and scientific applications.  In the Aerospace Industry simulation methods have been largely responsible for doubling the fuel efficiency of long range commercial aircraft since the advent of jet transport. The need for further improvement is crucial for both the economics and environmental impact of air transport, a jumbo jet releases its take-off weight (around 400 tons) in carbon dioxide emissions during a single flight. The European Union has recognized the importance of advancing simulation techniques with a variety of European wide and national initiatives (such as the German Mega Flow and Mega Design programs.)     Simulations and optimized redesign of the 747 wing can save tons\" of fuel, travel time and reduce emissions.   Computer simulation is equally crucial to advances in numerous other applications.  For example, simulations of blood flow through a beating heart and its valves, helps doctors understand and repair the malfunctioning heart;  simulation of air traffic control patterns can move that industry faster toward safer skies, reduce the occurrence of mid-air collisions and the time to reroute flights around weather systems;  modeling of air flow around computer chips and over the surface of a fast spinning disk drive improve function and reliability.  Today's ability to model huge global weather system can change the fate of nations struggling with tsunami's, floods,  the devastation of hurricanes;  Astrophysics and many studies of importance to National Security all rely on this new aspect of science and mathematics.  At the heart of all these is the development of more advanced numerical algorithms which provide the cornerstone of computational simulation. The proposed research intends to extend these  to more efficient high-order 3D methods,  While the immediate application of the research is to fluid flow problems related to aerospace, an improved fluid flow simulation capability is immediately transferable to other industrial and scientific applications, including those mentioned above as well as many others such as the automotive and marine industries, wind energy, and a wide range of environmental issues. Even the flow patterns in urban areas around buildings can be used to evaluate how germ or chemical particles would be spread by winds circulating through the 'canyons' of clustered tall buildings. Further advances in all aspects of computational simulation and its underlying numerical methology is essential in order to maintain the Unites States' technological leadership and competitiveness in the rapidly evolving global economy. The results of these developments and techniques will play an increasingly pivotal role and have major implications environmentally, scientifically economically and socially as the results filter down into the many applications using them today, as well as future applications that will need to evaluate complex nonlinear partial differential equations for a variety of physics."

The project has two parts:  (1) The study of boundary effects from the point of view of kinetic theory, in particular, the Boltzmann shock layer, initial layer, and their interactions, and the thermal, curvature, and condensation effects of the solid boundary;  (2) Study of multidimensional gas flow with shocks, in particular, the effects of shock reflections from a solid boundary on the overall flow patterns for the compressible Euler equations.      To analyze boundary effects from the point of view of kinetic theory is physically natural, as the inclusion of the microscopic velocity in the Boltzmann solutions allows for physically realistic modeling of the solid boundary conditions.  It is mathematically challenging, as the boundary condition, such as the Maxwell type of the interpolation of specular and diffusion reflection conditions, makes possible the study of the rich interactions of particles and fluid waves.  This project will pursue local analysis of the physical phenomena.     Multi-dimensional gas flow with shocks is the consequence of the strongly nonlinear effect of compression and the global interaction of the gas with the solid boundary.  Mathematical analysis thereby becomes highly nonlinear and global.  New extremal principles are needed for the construction of solutions with free boundary for nonlinear partial differential equations of mixed types.  Already, an Ellipticity Principle has helped to explain that, with given boundary condition at far field, the uniqueness is possible only for self-similar flow, and not for stationary flows.     The study of the boundary effects on gas flow is of great importance for engineering practices.  Mathematical analysis is needed for quantitative and qualitative understanding of the physical process.  A classical example is the vacuum pump based on the phenomenon of thermal gradient flow, rather than on mechanical devices, to generate pressure differences.  Preliminary analytical studies show that the thermal gradient flow is stronger for more rarefied gases, an important consideration in the design of vacuum pumps.  The study of Prandtl's conjecture and the von Neumann paradox in compressible gas flows provides basic understanding for the shock structure of supersonic flight.  For instance, mathematical analysis quantifies the difference between the shock structure at the nose and that inside the engine of an aircraft.  This project aims to advance understanding of the mathematical models of these important processes."

Properties of ecosystems constrain the range of possible pathways for agricultural intensification, and the nature of agricultural production can influence aspects of human societies.  At the same time, human societies create and develop specific systems of agricultural production that transform ecosystems, sometimes in dramatic ways.  The Hawaiian Archipelago offers excellent opportunities to explore the nature and consequences of interactions among ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human societies as they played out over centuries prior to European contact.  This collaborative research project will focus on intensive agriculture and society in Kohala, Hawai'i, where broad and well-defined environmental gradients encompass a large (60 km-square) and long-sustained rain-fed dryland agricultural system that was abandoned in the mid-19th century.  With participation from local communities and schools, experimental gardens will be established across the range of the field system.  This effort will draw on community input (traditional knowledge), archaeological observations, and ecosystem/soil analyses in addition to agricultural experimentation.  Once in place, these gardens will be used to develop physiologically based agricultural crop models and to determine how the agricultural system was organized and integrated; how it was sustained for centuries prior to European contact; and how it interacted with nearby irrigated systems.  This last effort will make use of strong differences in the abundances of multiple stable isotopes across the broad environmental gradient of Kohala.    The establishment of experimental gardens within the boundaries of the ancient and long-abandoned Kohala field system will serve several scientific and educational objectives.  A well-validated crop model for dryland crops will allow much more detailed calculations of agricultural yields; these in turn will make existing models of past agricultural production and human demography across the Kohala landscape more realistic.  Similarly, isotopic measurements of Hawaiian crops will support detailed interpretations of sources of food and other goods as these varied over space, time, and the social status of households in pre-contact Hawai'i.  Together these efforts will make it possible to determine how this and other large, rain-fed agricultural systems functioned and how they interacted with nearby communities based on irrigated agriculture.  The project therefore will contribute to understanding the evolution of complex societies.  The gardens represent an extraordinary educational resource because they will make a step toward restoring an example of the main pre-contact agricultural system on the island of Hawai'i.  School and community groups will make use of these gardens to learn science by conducting field experiments in a culturally meaningful setting.

The focus of the project is the search for a transformation that, when applied to the prosodic features, results in a single vector that can adequately represent the important characteristics of the original sequence of prosodic features. The proposed transform is formed by projecting the distribution of the features in a certain sample onto a set of probability distributions represented by dynamic Bayesian networks in a predetermined dictionary.    The ultimate goal of the project is the creation of a general probabilistic model-based transform paradigm that can act robustly on complex feature sets. This work will therefore also contribute to other domains where features exhibit characteristics that are challenging for standard approaches. The tools and corpora developed during the project will be made available to the community. The results from this project will contribute to scientific knowledge on the use of prosodic information and increase the capabilities of spoken language understanding and dialog systems."

Deep tremor is a more or less incessant, but weak, shaking of the ground that has been associated with large, but very slow earthquakes.  The nature of tremor, with long, but not impulsive, episodes of ground motion requires new and innovative approaches from seismologists because the usual analysis applied to ordinary earthquakes cannot be applied to tremor.  We are currently improving methods that have already been developed by the PI and his colleagues, and applying them to tremor in different areas.  We are also continue to develop new and improved methods for tremor analysis. Among these are matched-filter analysis of low frequency earthquakes, a running auto-correlation analysis of tremor episodes to detect low frequency earthquakes, and a ''sub-space'' detection algorithm for identifying similar, but not identical small low frequency earthquakes.  We use the understanding that emerges from this analysis to address the systematics of tremor behavior of the mechanics of the tremor process.  The areas of the proposed study are all areas where tremor occurrence is well documented, specifically: Cascadia, Southwest Japan, and Central California.  The strategic location of tremor -- at the boundary of the locked zone where we expect future large earthquakes to initiate -- and the emerging understanding that it represents shear slip on the plate boundary, makes this an important research target with significant potential implications for earthquake forecasting.  In particular, an improved understanding should help scientists to assess the significance of deep tremor for earthquake hazard in the Cascadia subduction zone and in central California, where tremor is observed deep under the Cholame segment of the San Andreas Fault, a segment that has not ruptured in over 150 years.      Another important broader impact is the international flavor of this work: U.S. researchers and graduate students will collaborate with researchers at the University of Tokyo, the National Institute for Earth Sciences and Disaster Prevention, and other institutions in Japan on significant portions of this research."

They are used routinely to constrain the subsurface geometry of active faults, to infer the spatial distribution of coseismic slip, and to study the response of the elastic crust to magma intrusion preceding volcanic eruptions. These data are the primary means for recording aseismic processes such as afterslip, viscoelastic and poroelastic adjustments and silent earthquakes. Accurate measurements of inflationary doming and stretching of the crust help in the forecasting of volcanic activity. Similar data play an important role in quantifying the kinematics of active landslides.    Using modern information theory, the investigators have generalized persistent scatterer techniques for InSAR, a visual geodetic technique that permits detailed mapping of motion over wide areas and exposes complex deformation patterns. Their technique helps to find stable points in natural terrain which can be used as a network of fiducial points in otherwise poor-quality interferograms. This will help extend InSAR analysis to heavily vegitated areas. The investigators are applying their new techniques to the San Francisco Bay segment of the San Andreas Fault and Hayward Fault. Their obervations will help follow the earthquake cycle in more areas and may compliment geodetic measurement of volcanoes, as well as improve InSAR capabilities in many other applications.     The Broader Impacts of the project include adding more information to assess natural hazards, like earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, in a variety of terrains, training of graduate students in these methods and making software and algorithms freely available to interested researchers."

Furthermore, many important physical and chemical processes are common to both styles of activity.  As magma ascends the decrease in pressure results in exsolution of volatile constituents, which has the dual effect of increasing melt viscosity and promoting crystal growth.  Considerable progress has been made in the past decade in modeling these processes, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to coupling the resultant tractions on the boundary of volcanic conduits to stress and deformation in the surrounding elastic medium.  At the same time commonly used volcano deformation models remain highly idealized, and these idealizations are particularly inadequate in the case of erupting volcanoes.  The goal of the proposed research is to more fully understand the driving forces and associated deformation and seismicity of effusive dome-building eruptions, with particular emphasis on the current eruption at Mount St. Helens.  The proposed work involves the development of coupled magma flow and deformation models, and the analysis of both near-conduit and broader scale deformation and seismic data at Mount St. Helens in order to better constrain these models.    The recent and largely unexpected reawakening of Mount St. Helens demonstrates serious limitations in our understanding of the processes that drive volcanic eruptions.  The ongoing eruption has raised a number of first-order questions including: How did St. Helens begin erupting with so little precursory activity?  Seismicity associated with the current eruption is limited to the upper few kilometers, yet magma is clearly rising from the mid-crust.  In contrast, seismic swarms in preceding decades extended from 2 to 9 km depth.  Were the earlier swarms associated with magma transport?  If not, what other processes could explain the seismicity?  What processes control the dramatic transient tilt signals in the near field of the extruding dome at Mt. St. Helens?  What constraints do they place on the mechanics of dome extrusion?  Following the onset of the eruption PBO and the USGS rushed to deploy GPS instruments on the volcano.  If we are to take advantage of improved monitoring data then it is imperative that we begin to consider more realistic deformation sources which take into account the physical properties of magma movement from depth and its effect on the surrounding medium.    We propose to develop both quasi-analytic and Finite Element Method (FEM) models that relate physical-chemical processes in the magma chamber and conduit system to surface deformation and seismicity.  Predictions of the coupled chamber/conduit models will be compared to observed time-dependent deformation and effusive flux to better constrain parameters such as magma chamber volume and recharge rate at Mt. St. Helens.  Various models of swarm seismogenesis will be investigated and compared to observations based on Dieterich's seismicity rate theory [Dieterich, Jour. Geopys. Res, 1994].  One promising model involves cyclic increase in stress due to crystallization-driven gas exsolution and pressurization interrupted by periods of gas escape.  Dramatic near vent tilt cycles will be analyzed to constrain the source of these transient deformations.  Finally, we will examine thermal models to test the hypothesis that the first erupted 2004 lavas were residual magmas from the 1980's dome-forming eruptions."

Ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism (i.e., at depths >80 km) is a consequence of continental subduction and collision. Investigation of such rarely exposed rocks can provide new insights into processes of continental collision, growth, and mountain building, as well as crust/mantle interaction. An outstanding question regarding UHP metamorphism concerns how these rocks return to the surface while preserving their high P/T mineral assemblages. Critical to addressing this question is a better understanding of the exhumation rates. To attain such information, this project focuses on well exposed eclogite-facies rocks of the North Qaidam Mountains of China. U-Pb geochronology of zircon, monazite and titanite will be coupled with pressure, temperature, and mineral paragenesis (based on REE geochemistry, mineral inclusion analysis, and thermobarometry) to evaluate ages of peak and retrograde metamorphism.  These data will constrain exhumation rates associated with their eclogite- to granulite- and amphibolite-facies decompression. Rates will be calculated based on the age difference (determined by U-Pb geochronology of accessory zircon and other phases) between superposed mineral growth zones corresponding to different pressures (depths) of formation (as inferred from mineral inclusions, REE geochemistry, and thermobarometry of garnet-bearing mineral assemblages). This study is likely to significantly advance our knowledge of the geologic history of the N. Qaidam terrane, and provide new perspectives on UHP exhumation processes in general.     Broader impacts. Central to this research is collaboration with Chinese colleagues, thereby enhancing international scientific exchange and cooperation.

This implies that processes acting over the surface of the Earth may be coupled to those acting within its interior. This project will use analogue models to study the influence that erosion may have played on the kinematic development of the Precordillera fold-and-thrust belt of central Argentina. Here, extensive field data constrain the kinematics of the fold-and-thrust belt, and work farther south in the Cordillera Principal, Cordillera Frontal, and Precordillera indicates that erosion may exert an important control on the evolving geometry of the fold-and-thrust. This project uses analytical formulations and scaled sandbox analogue models to understand how the kinematics of the fold-and-thrust belt evolve under different erosional conditions. An orogen-scale erosion rule that relates erosion rates to intrinsic factors, such as lithologic differences in rock erodibility, and extrinsic factors, such as climate changes will be used.  These results will be compared to the observed kinematics of the fold-and-thrust belt to deduce the role that erosion played in the mountain belt''s development. In addition, a series of forward analogue models that consider temporal changes in erosional conditions associated with the exposure of rock types with varying resistance to erosion and long-time-period changes in climate will be performed. This multi-tiered approach will first provide insight into those aspects of the kinematics of the Precordillera fold-and-thrust belt that may be strongly influenced by erosion, and then will expand these specific results to a range of changing erosional conditions that might be related to exposure of different rock types in fold-and-thrust belts and global climate changes.    The discovery that deep earth processes may be linked to those of the shallow earth is perhaps one of the most important recent contributions to the theory of plate tectonics. If true, this concept will temper interpretations of the past and current operation of mountain belts, and may lead geoscientists to reinterpret many aspects of the geologic record in new ways. Currently, most studies that seek to establish this new paradigm have concentrated their efforts on qualitative comparisons of general numerical model results with scare field observations. This study will be the first to compare specific model predictions to a well-studied mountain belt to determine if surface processes are necessary to explain its development. Results of this research will help to establish this linkage between deep earth and surface processes, and to understand how strong these links may be in different tectonic and erosional environments. The study includes an international team of scientists from the United States, Venezuela, and Canada, and will promote the education of under-represented high school students through outreach programs."

In this proposal, we ask the following question: is it possible to have the \"\"geographical position\"\" of a party take part in defining the set of credentials  she has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what we can achieve in this setting?    First, we propose to consider the central task in this setting, i.e.,  securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we have preliminary results that show that in the \"\"vanilla\"\" (i.e., standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure  positioning) is impossible to achieve.    We  propose to study the proof of position in the bounded storage model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary).  In this setting, we wish to achieve   two tasks: secure positioning, and position-based key exchange. While the question of secure positioning has been asked in the past, no satisfactory answers exist.     The second question (of position-based key exchange) has not been asked in the past.

This study combines novel remote sensing technologies with careful reconstructions of forest history to understand disturbance and recovery in rain forests that differ substantially in climate and soil fertility across the Hawaiian Islands.  High-precision remote measurements will yield a detailed and very broad-scale view of the structure and chemistry of these forests, and this information will be used to identify patterns of disturbance and recovery across landscapes.  These patterns will be checked and refined using on-the-ground measurements of site histories (based on pollen profiles dated using lead isotopes), soil fertility, and biological diversity.      Tropical forests contribute substantially to carbon fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems, to climate, and to many other aspects of global biogeochemistry and diversity.  Their dynamics are known to depend strongly upon their disturbance regimes, which in turn depend on differences among tropical forests in climate and soil fertility.

The main issues are bridging the gap between relevant biological time scales, in this case the opening and closing of ion channels, and time scales accessible to direct molecular dynamics simulations which are much shorter. A step in this direction will be the creation of a new time and space adaptive scheme (AVI and HiGrid) which accelerates the sampling of the different protein conformations accessible at a given temperature. In addition, techniques (the string method and the ABF algorithm) to explore transition pathways between stable conformations of the system will be developed. The novelty of this approach is that the pathways are computed in terms of many collective variables instead of the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms as is usually done. This leads to greater robustness and physically more relevant pathways.    The ability to sense touch depends on nanometer sized ion channels located in the membrane of sensory neurons. When force is exerted in the skin these channels open to let a flow of ions go in or out of the cell, a phenomenon called gating. These nano-machines are part of a complex apparatus which converts mechanical force into electric signals and transports information from the skin to neurons. By bringing together expertise in biology, high performance computing and mathematics, the investigators will produce atomically accurate models of the gating mechanism in the only metazoan mechanotransduction channel known to date."

Gordon  Proposal 0718631  The relation of foraging activity and reproductive success in red harvester ant colonies    A fundamental question in behavioral ecology is how natural selection is shaping behavior.  To answer this we need to know whether individuals that behave in a certain way are more likely to reproduce.  The project continues a 25-year study of a population of about 350 red harvester ant colonies in southeastern Arizona.  This is the longest-term behavioral and demographic study of any social insect population.  Previous work shows that colonies compete for food, so foraging behavior should be important for colony survival and reproduction.  The study will examine whether colonies that regulate foraging more effectively are more successful in reproducing.  In social insects, colonies are the reproductive individuals, and it is notoriously difficult to measure the reproductive success of colonies.  Genetic tools are needed to identify parent-offspring pairs.  This is feasible only in a population in which a large sample of individual colonies can be followed throughout their life cycles.  The proposed work will draw on unique long-term data and genetic markers.  This will be an innovative application of genetic methods to develop a new measure of the reproductive success of social insect colonies.  Social insect behavior raises intriguing questions because colonies operate without central control.  Individual workers make decisions, using local information, that in the aggregate produce the coordinated behavior of the colony.  Previous work shows that the regulation of foraging behavior depends on a network of interactions between workers. Combining behavioral measures of foraging activity with data on the reproductive success of known, individual colonies, this project will ask whether better foraging leads to higher reproductive success.  This will make it possible to discover how natural selection is currently shaping the organization of ant colonies.    The work will provide extensive laboratory and field research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including women and minorities. The results will be incorporated into the PI''s outreach activities, including writing and speaking for the general public, and volunteer work in local schools. This long-term project now provides the most substantial demographic data on any social insect population, which will be available to people interested in using it."

This work is the first application of modern genome-enabled technologies (transcriptomics - the study of gene expression, and proteomics - identification of proteins present in a cell) to describe the dynamics of thousands of genes and proteins simultaneously in marine animals subjected to environmental stress.  In addition, this project will compare gene sequences and protein structure and function to identify the characteristics of proteins that determine the species'' different tolerance limits.      This project has many broader impacts.  These studies will examine why an invasive blue mussel species from the Mediterranean Sea has successfully replaced the native blue mussel along the southern portion of the Pacific Coast of North America.  The blue mussels to be studied are of great interest to researchers in ecology, marine science, and evolutionary biology, as well as to State and Federal natural resource managers who seek to understand the environmental impacts of climate change on natural populations and the processes by which invasive species succeed in new habitats.  The results will be of special significance to the \"\"Mussel Watch\"\" Project, which uses mussels to monitor the water quality status of coastal and estuarine waters.  The collaboration between Stanford University and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, brings together students from all stages of training, from high school students to postdoctoral researchers, in an effort to foster a socially and ethnically diverse research environment.

While the causes of the extinction event are debated and of intense interest, the effect of the ensuing community changes on species that survived the extinction has not been well investigated.  Yet knowledge about effects on survivors will be immensely valuable to predictions of future biodiversity.  Thus, instead of studying the Pleistocene extinction solely from the perspective of why species went extinct, PIs are keen to investigate how, or in fact, whether, surviving species were affected by the extinction event.  PIs therefore propose to use the rich but untapped Quaternary fossil resources of Shasta County, California, to investigate the response of the mammal species that survived the Pleistocene-Holocene transition event.  Their primary goal is to determine community, species, and population response of survivors to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and to sort out whether the response was due to megafaunal extinction, climatic change or both.  To document the nature of late Quaternary disturbance events and impacts on the biota, they will use an interdisciplinary approach, based on tracing changes in morphometrics, isotopes, genetics, and community composition of fossil mammals.  This will be facilitated by (i) excavations and analyses of newly discovered and known fossil sites; (ii) obtaining secure stratigraphic control with multiple radiocarbon dates and other geochronologic and stratigraphic techniques; (iii) conducting genetic analyses aimed at detecting signs of population subdivision, density changes and local extirpation; (iv) comparison of pre- and post-extinction communities in terms of taxonomic composition, total species richness, species richness within various size and trophic categories, abundance and evenness of species; (v) tracing phenotypic changes in populations; and (vi) using ancient DNA with phylochronologic techniques to directly recognize genetic structuring of fossil populations.  All of the biotic changes will be interpreted within the framework of the extensive extinction and climatic changes that are documented in their study area and globally."

To meet these demanding requirements embedded systems are turning to parallelism (for performance) and special-purpose hardware (for efficiency). This trend has created a pair of technology gaps in programming of embedded systems.  First, few tools exist to map embedded applications to parallel systems. Second, using special-purpose hardware (ASICs) for the computationally demanding parts of applications makes it impossible to program these parts of the applications.     This project seeks to close both of these technology gaps.  First, the project is developing a programming system for mapping embedded systems to parallel (multi-core) platforms.  This system takes  ?C? code, annotated with real-time constraints, and automatically partitions operations across multiple processors, placing data and coordinating communication and synchronization. The partitioning will be done to meet real-time constraints, to balance load, and to minimize energy consumed.  Second, the project is developing a programmable multi-core platform that matches the efficiency of hard-wired (ASIC) logic on embedded kernels.  The approach is to optimize data and instruction movement to eliminate much of the overhead and inefficiency of conventional processors.  The design of the processor is then optimized to close the gap with ASICs.    This research is expected to enable a renaissance in embedded system design.  It will enable rapid development of embedded systems for emerging multi-core platforms and will ensure that such systems operate efficiently and meet real-time constraints.  It will also enable the rapid development of efficient embedded systems for applications and algorithms for which hard-wired modules do not exist.  Overall, this research seeks to make possible the development of embedded systems that simply are not feasible with today's programming tools and platforms."

Variation caused by dialects and accents make this task even more daunting. Sometimes when one meets a person with a distinctive accent, communication breaks down due to misunderstandings. Consider the word 'card'. A listener may encounter unfamiliar productions of this word that sound like other words:   *  'cart' when produced by a native Polish speaker,   *  'cod' when produced by a Bostonian, or   *  'guard' when produced by a native Spanish speaker.   The differences between the familiar pronunciation of 'card' and the variations above are minimal. But in language, minimal differences are what make two words distinct, and the variation in spoken words can cross the perceptual boundaries between words. As experience with a speaker or accent increases, there are fewer misunderstandings presumably because one learns something about the speech or the accent.  This project investigates how this sort of perceptual adjustment takes place. What information do listeners focus on in order to learn a new variant of a word? Do one learn something about a specific voice, or about a general accent? By examining how native speakers of English perceive and recognize non-native speech, better understand how learning takes place can be achieved, what types of information are critical in learning, and how new information is mentally represented.    Particularly, the problem of how listeners learn to use new or unfamiliar acoustic cues to resolve potential misunderstandings is investigated, by examining how listeners respond to different words and word pairs, as illustrated above, over time. For example, in the beginning of an experiment, a subject may treat non-native productions of 'cart' and 'card' as the same word (e.g., 'cart'). But over time, and with training, the subject may alter his or her perceptual categories and begin to hear the productions as two different words -- as intended by the speaker. By manipulating whether listeners hear the words presented by a single speaker, multiple speakers from a single language, or multiple speakers from different languages throughout the experiment it can be determined whether the adjustments are particular to one voice, one language, or one learning process."

Yet, evaluating the empirical relevance of these predictions has been challenging, mainly due to data limitation. This proposed research will take a step towards filling this gap by analyzing unique data sets that are especially suited to test the selection and incentive effects of equal-sharing. The data contain rich panel information on both individuals and Kibbutzim (plural of Kibbutz), which are communities that have recently shifted non-uniformly from an equal-sharing scheme to pay-for-performance.    Broadly, the three proposed projects will contribute to incentive theory, which is at the heart of economics. The first project tests whether equal-sharing discourages participation of high-ability workers. It analyzes exit from and entry to Kibbutzim with a unique panel data of individuals linked across population censuses.  The second project provides a unique empirical analysis of the free-rider problem by testing whether and to what extent equal-sharing leads to free riding behavior in the decisions of hours worked, absenteeism from work and fertility. To do so, this project merges individual-level Labor Force Surveys, which are conducted annually and contain information on these decisions, with a unique Kibbutz-level data set constructed through archival work. The project performs difference-in-difference analysis to test whether members in Kibbutzim that shifted away from full equal-sharing during the sample period worked longer hours, reduced absenteeism and reduced fertility.  The third project tests the factors mitigating the trade-off between insurance and participation.  A simple model of the Kibbutz as an insurance device facing participation constraints is considered and confronted with the data. The empirical test evaluates the relative importance of factors highlighted by the model vs. ideological factors highlighted by sociologists in determining the degree of equal-sharing and in mitigating negative selection.    BROADER IMPACT: This research contributes to our understanding of organizations that are subject to negative selection. Among these are professional partnerships, cooperatives, and labor managed firms, which are often based on revenue-sharing. For example, in professional partnerships such as law firms, just like as Kibbutzim, high-ability partners are expected to exit to earn a wage premium for their ability outside of the partnership.  Second, this research will be among the first to test using individual-level data a well-known yet widely-disputed hypothesis, which has implications regarding immigration policy. This hypothesis, known as Borjas'' selection hypothesis, postulates a positive self-selection of migrants when the country of origin has a more equal earnings distribution than the destination, while a negative self-selection is expected when the country of origin has a more unequal earnings distribution. If it holds empirically, this hypothesis implies that immigrants from more equal origins are more likely to be of high quality.  Third, by evaluating the extent to which individuals free ride at the workplace, this project sheds light on the usefulness of unemployment benefit programs. Also, by evaluating the effect on fertility of an extreme change in fertility incentives, this project contributes to our understanding of the usefulness of programs designed to encourage fertility, an issue that is subject to policy debates in Europe.  Last, Kibbutzim present a puzzle for economists as economic theory predicts that communities based on equal-sharing are likely to unravel due to moral hazard and adverse selection. Yet, unlike many other communes in history, Kibbutzim have persisted successfully for most of the 20th century and formed one of the largest communal movements in history, consisting today of 120,000 members living in 268 Kibbutzim. This research will shed light on this puzzle by analyzing the factors that allow Kibbutzim to coexist within a capitalist environment and evaluating the role of economic factors in organizations often claimed to be driven by ideology."

The entry behavior of a firm into an oligopoly market typical depends on the entry behavior of other competing firms.  Many firm entry models have a game theoretic foundation.  Understanding the empirical contents of game theoretic models, in which the strategic choices of competing firms are mutually interdependent, has important implication on the economic policies of antitrust and regulation.  The information structure of strategic competition models can be differentiated based whether firms maximize static or dynamic expected profits, and whether each competing firm possesses private information that can not be observed by other market participants.  Several research projects supported by this NSF grant aim to study econometric models of strategic interactions where competing firms choose between a finite number of mutually exclusive actions.     The first project studies identification and estimation of static versions of game theoretic strategic competition models under the private information assumption.  An algorithm is developed to compute the entire set of equilibria in these models.  Application of these estimation and computation methods to the market of stock analyst recommendations discovers strong evidence of peer influence and substantial impact of multiple equilibria.      The second project extends the static models to a dynamic setting where competing firms interact repeatedly in a Markov perfect equilibrium.  The results of the analysis show that the structural parameters of these models can be identified from data on the entry behavior of firms.  The identification analysis naturally leads to a flexible nonparametric estimator and a practical semi-parametric estimator for dynamic oligopolistic models with both continuous and discrete state variables.  A unique data set on oil exploration is being collected to demonstrate the empirical predictions of these models.  The third project allows for a complete information setting where latent shocks to firm profits are commonly observable to all the firms and agents.  A feasible computation algorithm is developed to facilitate estimating these models with multiple and mixed strategy equilibria.  Application of this algorithm to entry behavior in California highway procurement auctions recovers significant entry costs by bidding firms and significant multiple equilibria determinants of entry behavior.    Broader impacts. The results of this research have potentially important economic applications beyond those in the field of industrial organization.  The econometric methods developed in these research projects will be useful for problems in applied microeconomics where the utilities of agents are interdependent and agents interact strategically.

Such games allow the rigorous modeling of important real-life economic interactions such as cartels, partnerships, and employer-employee relationships.  While realistic, the assumption of private monitoring has proved cumbersome, in large part due to the difficulty in verifying whether simple strategies are, or are not, equilibria.  Due to this, many previous studies have proposed valid but exotic equilibria unlikely to be observed in reality but where incentives conditions can be checked to verify that they are indeed equilibria.    The first part of this project develops and presents set-based methods for constructing equilibria in this class of games.  Attention is restricted to a large class of realistic strategies - those which can be represented as finite automata.  It leads to a robust methodology for verifying whether any particular strategy is, or is not, an equilibrium.  Such verification had previously been described as a difficult, if not impossible, task.  Using these methods, simple equilibria can be verified on a laptop computer in a fraction of a second.  The second part of this project entails the development of web-based computer codes to allow the users to easily apply the developed methods for their own economic applications.     The third part uses the newly developed methods to study the robustness of classes of strategies.  A strategy is considered a robust equilibrium if it is an equilibrium not only for the game in question, but an equilibrium for near-by games with slightly perturbed payoffs.  Players in real-life situations are unlikely to have common knowledge of each others' payoffs and hence this notion of robustness checks if postulated dynamic strategies survive small uncertainty about payoffs.  Here, preliminary results are simple and stark: an equilibrium is robust if and only if it is a function only of the last k periods of play (for some finite k).      Broader Impacts:  The ability to formally study realistically complex repeated human interactions which necessarily involve some people seeing, and acting upon, signals and actions that other people (for example, competitors, partners, principals, co-workers etc.) with whom they interact do not see."

All animals, including humans, have the ability to regulate their body temperature by moving to favorable areas in the environment. This behavioral thermoregulation is thought to involve thermosensory neurons in the skin, an internal set point and complex feedback. A major challenge in understanding behavioral thermoregulation is to identify animals amenable to mechanistic analysis. With only 302 nerve cells (neurons), the roundworm C. elegans is an almost perfect organism for such studies. It is the only animal in which the shape of every neuron and its connections to other neurons is known (the wiring diagram). A sub-circuit of 11 bilaterallysymmetric neurons mediate initial responses to temperature. All of these neurons can be identified in living animals, including a pair of neurons that sense cooling and warming (the AFD cells) and are critical for thermotaxis.     In C. elegans, but not in mammals, it is possible to directly measure how these neurons respond to temperature. The proposed research leverages these advantages of C. elegans and takes an integrated approach, analyzing temperature sensation at the molecular and cellular level. Experiments are proposed to deconstruct the molecular networks that make temperature sensation possible and to discover genes responsible for the development or function of neurons that link sensation to behavior. Because the wiring diagram is known, future experiments can investigate the neural circuit linking temperature sensation by AFD to motor output. In C. elegans, the AFD neurons are critical for successful thermotaxis. Other nematodes, which are parasites of agriculturally important plants and animals, are thought to use thermotaxis as part of a host-finding strategy. Some of these parasitic nematodes are known to have neurons similar to AFD, suggesting that the proposed research could have broader implications. In particular, what is learned about the molecular networks responsible for temperature could provide entry points for new research into methods for controlling nematode species that threaten agriculture.     The intellectual merit of this work lies in the establishment of a new animal model for mechanistic analysis of temperature sensation and its behavioral consequences. It has the potential to offer insight into universal molecular, cellular and network-level mechanisms by which sensory information provides essential, real-time feedback for movement. The work derives broad impact from its multidisciplinary approach, combining the experimental and conceptual tools of genetics, cell physiology, and behavioral studies. Since its inception, high school students and undergraduates have contributed to the work, including women and minority participants in the Stanford Summer Research Program. Research opportunities for undergraduates will continue to be an integral part of the proposed work.

These motions contain a \"pulse\" in the velocity time history of the motion, typically in the direction perpendicular to the fault rupture, and generally occur at locations near the fault where the earthquake rupture has propagated towards the site. It is important to understand the effects of these ground motions, because they have been observed to cause severe damage to structures.  Through a series of innovations in ground motion processing, seismic hazard analysis, and structural response studies, the research will produce a new comprehensive framework to understand and account for directivity effects. An automated signal processing scheme for identifying directivity pulses will be developed and implemented as an open-source software program; preliminary results from the procedure show great promise in removing user judgment from ground motion classification. When coupled with parametric studies of structural response from pulse-like ground motions, this analysis will form the basis for a new set of near-fault design code factors and ground motion selection guidelines for structures that might experience ground motion directivity effects.    Intellectual Merit:  The potential risk from near-fault ground motions has long been known, and methods to account for this risk have been discussed for many years. The project will result in new ways of identifying velocity pulses, accounting for directivity in seismic hazard analysis, and predicting the effects of these pulses on structural response. Bringing these quantitative tools together will help engineers and seismologists more fundamentally understand the effect of this phenomenon, and will give owners greater confidence that their structure has been designed using rational tools to account for all effects of ground shaking. While the importance of this near-fault problem is widely recognized, no holistic treatment of the ground motion classification, hazard analysis, and structural response problems has been attempted to date.      Broader Impact:  Understanding the effects of these ground motions, and implementing these findings in the form of design guidelines, will ultimately lead to safer, more efficient and more economical designs.  Thus the findings from this work will address a major safety concern that affects the safety of structures used by all people living and working near active seismic faults. The project will foster ongoing outreach activities involving undergraduates and underrepresented minorities. Developed knowledge and approaches will also be integrated into education through open-source software tools and publication of journal articles, conference presentations, and a project website containing educational resources."

While there have been significant accomplishments in scientific discovery of CNFETs in recent years at the single-device level, a major gap exists between such single-device-level results and the research required to harness the science into practical design technologies at the end of device scaling of silicon transistors. This research project targets to close this gap by developing necessary technologies required to make CNFETs practical candidates for replacing silicon transistors.    The objective of this research is to design of robust nanoscale computing fabrics using Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) in the presence of inherent limitations and imperfections, and to experimentally demonstrate essential components of a fabric such as a  processor. This research is motivated by the fact that CNFETs are promising candidates as extensions to Silicon CMOS, yet fundamental nanoscale challenges prevent successful implementations of efficient CNFET-based circuits and systems. This project includes an interdisciplinary research team to demonstrate robust CNFET-based computing fabrics, and also to educate future generations of engineers and the general public in the emerging field of nanoscale computing."

It is well known that the behavior of particulate media, such as sands, is encoded at the granular-scale and hence methods for up-scaling such behavior across relevant scales of interest?from granular-scale (~1mm) to field-scale (>1m)?are needed to attain a more accurate prediction of soil behavior. Multi-scale analysis is especially important under extreme conditions such as strain localization, penetration or liquefaction, where the classical constitutive description may no longer apply. Several unanswered questions illustrate the importance of studying such phenomena: What material parameterizations are most appropriate at various scales? What are the relevant scales needed for an accurate material description? What are the impacts of uncertainties and inhomogeneities on field-scale behavior? A probabilistic framework across multiple scales is needed to answer these questions and to consistently compute the behavior of the material across scales.       In an unprecedented fashion, probabilistic models for soil porosity are developed at multiple scales, using experimental results from X-Ray computed tomography to study spatial correlation down to the millimeter scale. From a computational standpoint, the multi-scale framework is demonstrated using well-established models for sands. In this hierarchical approach, a more accurate material description?at finer scales?is pursued only in the presence of strong inhomogeneities, either material or imposed (e.g. by deformations). The hierarchical approach is based on passing the macroscopic deformation down to the finer scale(s) and then returning more accurate, averaged stresses. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate material properties in a hierarchical manner, so that fine scale material data can be obtained whenever necessary, conditional upon previously simulated coarse scale data. These modeling approaches will be developed and then used in several parametric and validation studies to bring insight to practical problems where multi-scale effects are important. Multi-scale modeling opens the door to develop design-specific engineering systems with desirable qualities or properties, and will allow scientists and engineers to better understand the role of finer scales on the behavior of complex geotechnical systems."

In fact, even `point-to-point' systems, where the end goal is to transfer information in one direction, often give rise to two-way communication scenarios due to the presence of feedback. In such systems, one can receive feedback from the other end of the channel, which can be used to improve the quality of communication.  Although feedback is present in many communication systems, and is being used in certain primitive forms as in channel estimation and automatic repeat request, the theory behind its use is far from complete.  This research investigates the role of feedback in two-way communication networks and provides architecture-level guidance for designing robust and efficient communication systems. While positive results lead to novel approaches to communication systems design, negative results prevent over-engineering and allow more confidence in simple and modular implementations.  At the same time, feedback is a pivotal concept in biological and artificial control systems, learning machines, and communication networks. A deeper understanding of the role of feedback in one area (communication) will lead to a better understanding of the role of feedback in a broader multidisciplinary context.    Concretely, this research focuses on and develops new approaches for tackling problems arising in the following areas: 1) feedback capacity of single-user channels with memory (new coding theorems based on directed information, causal conditioning, and Shannon strategy, as well as the development of concrete schemes for achieving the fundamental limits), 2) multiple-user channels with feedback (emphasis on multiple access channels and broadcast channels: characterization of fundamental limits as well as the construction of practical coding schemes), 3) capacity region of the two-way channel such as the Blackwell-Shannon binary multiplying channel (dynamic programming and infinite-dimensional convex optimization), 4) robust feedback coding techniques under channel uncertainty (universal decoding schemes), and 5) reliable communication with noisy feedback (new perspectives on cross-layer design of channel codes and network protocols).  Massey's directed information takes the role of Shannon's mutual information in many feedback communication problems.  Thus the role of directed information is investigated as a fundamental notion in general causal inference problems.  Examples include gambling in horse-race markets with causal side information and its dual in source coding."

Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to both factors.  In this research, scientists from Stanford University will focus on the effects of acidification, combining novel methods and approaches from the fields of engineering, physical oceanography, and marine biogeochemistry to develop a quantitative understanding of the flow of carbon throughout the physical environment and varied communities of a healthy coral reef.  During four field seasons at Heron Island Marine Station, located on the Great Barrier Reef, they will make the first simultaneous and in situ measurements of Net Community Production/Respiration and Net Community Calcification/Dissolution on a large intact coral reef tract by determining water column inorganic carbon system properties along the boundaries of a 3-dimensional control volume (CV).      The overall goals of the proposed research are to: 1) Quantify how energy flows between a coral reef and the open ocean, and within different reef environments, by direct, in situ measurements of carbon system fluxes; 2) Describe diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variability in primary production and calcification and their dependency on flow regime and carbonate saturation state; and 3) Develop predictive assessments regarding the interactive response of coral reef systems to ongoing perturbations of global climate and the carbon cycle. To achieve these goals, the PIs will install an array of current meters, wave gauges, and thermistors to determine the hydrodynamic regime within the control volume at a spatial scale of 10 cm and time scale of seconds.  Then, using the Reynolds Transport Theorem and water column carbon chemistry data, they will calculate net fluxes through each of the four CV faces and the surface boundary, and thereby determine net carbon fluxes between the benthic community and the overlying water.    Broader impacts includes student mentoring, international collaboration, and outreach efforts.  Stanford University conducts an overseas study program in Australia that will permit 3 to 5 undergraduate students to participate in this project for their honors thesis.

A flow is a collection of packets that belong to the same  ``transaction'', such as a datagram, an ftp transfer, or a web download. It is the  fundamental unit of data that a user cares about. Current packet-switched networks,  like the Internet and Gigabit Ethernet, are designed to process packets; they are unaware  of the flow to which a packet belongs. This is because flow-recognition is widely  considered to be too expensive to implement. However, a switch or a router's ability  to recognize flows can lead to a marked improvement in its performance, to a better  use of its resources, and to much more secure networks.       The first major aim of this program is to design novel algorithms and data structures  for high-speed, \"flow-aware\" networks. Such algorithms could heavily influence the  design of commercial switches and routers. A second major thrust concerns the  development of flow-level models of networks: models which capture the impact of  packet-level decisions on flow-level bandwidth allocation and flow processing times. An important component of the modeling work is the unification and generalization of  two researce enterprises: Stochastic Network Theory, and Large Random Networks. The  former studies the performance of a, typically non-random, queueing network subject  to \"random inputs\". The latter concerns the study of \"random networks\", usually subject  to deterministic inputs. A successful outcome of these efforts can help answer questions  such as the throughput and flow delay of a particular bandwidth allocation scheme, and the effect of routing topology on end-to-end performance. In other words, the  modeling effort aims to develop a realistic, simple and usable class of models for network flows."

Microarrays, which perform large-scale multiplexing on two-dimensional substrates, have transformed biomedical research by enabling genome wide investigation of genetic variation and function. Micro-barcode particles are poised to translate this capability to a three-dimensional, free-solution format, greatly expanding the possibilities of this powerful technology. Rod-shaped metallic particles with 0.25 to 1 micron diameters and lengths of 2 to 10 microns (Nanoplex, Menlo Park, CA) can be grown with metallic stripes that encode on the order of 10 bits of information. Each micro-barcode particle carries an identifiable signature, analogous to a conventional barcode, that serves as a mechanism for tracking molecular probes, such as oligonucleotides, attached to the particle surface. Many such particles then be mixed, reacted with a sample, and detected in parallel in a single chamber or fluidic channel. We propose to develop an automated particle flow control, electricfield alignment, sorting, and readout technology applicable to massively-parallel oligonucleotide synthesis. We will build and demonstrate custom-designed microfluidic devices, that for the first time, will control, read, and sort micro-barcode particles in microfluidic systems. Critical to the device design and optimization, will be the development of generalized electro-kinetic models that account for particle Brownian motion, electrophoresis (including mono- and multi-pole electrokinetic effects), hydrodynamic forces, and sedimentation in confined geometries. These models will be in the form of large-scale multi-particle simulations using novel numerical codes being developed jointly with the experiments. The large-scale simulations will allow us to accurately predict the location, velocity and orientation of the particles as they travel through the device, and thus quantitatively predict device performance.    We have performed preliminary experiments in which we align and subsequently track the positions and orientations of cylindrical particles 5 microns long and 0.25 microns in diameter under settling conditions in both DC and AC electric fields. In additional to the initial experiments, we have already developed simulation tools to model the sedimentation of a large number of Brownian rods at low Reynolds number with electrophoretic alignment and particle-induced electrophoretic flow in periodic systems, thus determining the initial flow parameter regimes that we will ultimately examine in detail. The broader research impact and intellectual merit of our work includes a fundamental understanding of a number of unsolved problems in suspension mechanics which directly bear on the performance of these barcode readers. These issues include developing our understanding of (a) the rheology of rod-like polymer and rod-like colloidal particle suspensions from dilute through semi-dilute including ICEP interactions; (b) the effect of ICEP flow on the collective phenomena associated with the simultaneous sedimentation and mean flow of fiber suspensions; (c) the action of shear-induced diffusion on the center of mass motion of the rod-like particles; and (d) the collective dynamics of rod suspensions in non-local flows, i.e. those in which the mean flow scale is on the order of the length of the rod. Indeed, even though these principles are intrinsic to the science of the microfluidics of complex fluids, many of the combinations of these nonlinear physics will be examined for the first time. Moreover, the broad educational impact associated with using large scale computing for design of microfluidic devices will be developed as an integral part of two summer internships for high school science teachers via a partnership with Stanford's Summer Research Program for Science Teachers. These internships will include faculty at one or two Title I schools. One internship will be associated with the experimental aspects of the research and the other with the computational design aspects. The internships will allow the faculty members to work closely with the PIs and graduate students and form a working group to understand the applications of microfluidic technology and advanced computing as an engineering design tool, and thereafter take experimental expertise, demonstrations and computer simulations back to the classroom."

By using a mono-molecular layer as the active organic semiconductor layer, the effect of exposure to explosive chemicals is readily sensed and can lead to a much more dramatic change in the current flow than when a thicker organic semiconductor layer is used.  Currently, such transistors are being fabricated using expensive electron beam lithography because only small ordered domain sizes are formed from self assembled monolayers.  This research seeks to understand the materials requirements and design rules for organic semiconductors needed for explosive chemical sensing applications.  The project pursues several methods to efficiently and reliably fabricate large arrays of monolayer transistors, including a new method for forming large ordered monolayers by simple spin-coating, Langmuir Blodgett film approach, and direct writing of electrodes onto vacuum evaporated organic semiconductor monolayers using Dip Pen Nanolithography.  The project then investigates the sensing capability of such films.

Arctic surface air temperatures are increasing at a faster rate than most anywhere else on Earth. The multi-year ice pack that covers the central Arctic Ocean has thinned from 3.1 m in the 1960's to 1.8 m in the 1990's. Over this time period, the long-term areal extent of sea ice has decreased by 14%. Although these changes could represent a component in a natural cycle, this trend could also be a harbinger of the \"meltdown\" of the Arctic in response to anthropogenic climate warming. Whether man-made or natural, the observed fluctuations in sea-ice extent dramatically affect the unique and fragile arctic marine ecology. Assessing the effects of present variability in sea-ice cover and hydrography on arctic marine ecosystems and regional climate (and a fortiori that of a potential net reduction of arctic sea ice in response to climate change) requires a substantial improvement in our understanding of the links between, among other components, freshwater and sea ice, sea ice and climate, and sea ice and biogeochemical fluxes.    The extensive arctic shelves (25% of global shelf area) are of central importance in any arctic change scenario. The shelves themselves are strongly influenced by widely differing physical and environmental processes. The waters on some shelves are influenced by extra-Arctic import of ocean waters, for example, the Alaskan shelf is influenced by the North Pacific Ocean waters via transport through the Bering Strait, while other shelves are principally influenced by riverine input, such as the Mackenzie shelf which is greatly affected by the seasonal inflow of the Mackenzie River. The sea-ice cover can also vary greatly between shelves, with individual shelves having differing amounts of landfast ice cover, lead polynya, and stamukhi zones. The peculiarities of sea-ice cover over individual shelves, in turn, determines the air-sea exchange of heat and moisture over the shelf and constrains the strongly pulsed annual cycle of biological productivity. The differences in ice-cover character also affect the export of carbon to the pelagic and benthic food webs, and to the deep Arctic basins where it is ultimately sequestered.    Given the importance of the shelves, the need for observational data has been particularly strong for these shallow, coastal regions (30% of the Arctic basin) where variability in the extent, thickness and duration of sea ice has been most pronounced and where Arctic marine food webs are most vulnerable to change. In recent years, two major observational programs have been launched and have garnished significant physical, geochemical, and biological data over specific Arctic shelves. The successful Shelf-Basin Interaction (SBI) project over the Alaskan Shelf and Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES) over the Mackenzie shelf represents a major step forward in quality and quantity of observational data upon which a model of the present and future behavior of the Arctic shelf systems can be constructed. This project will construct a robust, coupled physical and biological model of the Alaskan and Mackenzie shelf ecosystems and their interaction with the Arctic basin, based on the observational data sets of the SBI and CASES programs. A thorough analysis and intercomparison of these two physical, chemical, and biological oceanographic data sets will be performed, allowing for an improved understanding of the universal and non-universal properties of polar shelf ecosystems. A coupled physical, chemical, and biological model of the two specific Arctic shelves and their nesting inside a pan-Arctic computer model will allow us to better understand the present function of these shelves, as well as their future behavior in the larger changing Arctic environment."

In the Ross Sea, primary production is dominated by two taxa that are distinct in location and timing.  Diatoms dominate in the shallow mixed layer of the continental shelf, whereas the colony forming Phaeocystis antarctica (Prymnesiophyceae) dominate in the more deeply mixed, open regions. Significantly, both groups have vastly different nutrient utilization characteristics, and support very different marine food webs.  Their responses to climate change, and the implications for carbon export, are unclear.  Previous studies show that light availability and the quality of the light climate (static versus dynamic) play a major role in defining where and when the different phytoplankton taxa bloom. However, iron (Fe) limitation of the algal communities in both the sub-Arctic and the Southern Ocean is now well documented. Moreover, phytoplankton Fe demand varies as a function of irradiance.  The main hypothesis of the proposed research is: The interaction between Fe limitation and dynamic irradiance governs phytoplankton distributions in the Ross Sea.  Our strategy to test this hypothesis is three-fold: 1) The photoacclimation of the different phytoplankton taxa to different light conditions under Fe limitation will be investigated in experiments in the laboratory under controlled Fe conditions. 2) The photophysiological mechanisms found in these laboratory experiments will then be tested in the field on two cruises with international IPY partners. 3) Finally, data generated during the lab and field parts of the project will be used to parameterize a dynamic light component of the Coupled Ice Atmosphere and Ocean (CIAO) model of the Ross Sea. Using the improved model, we will run future climate scenarios to test the impact of climate change on the phytoplankton community structure, distribution, primary production and carbon export in the Southern Ocean. The proposed research complies with IPY theme\" Understanding Environmental change in Polar Regions\" and includes participation in an international cruise.  Detailed model descriptions and all of the results generated from these studies will be made public via a DynaLiFe website. Improving the CIAO model will give us and other IPY partners the opportunity to test the ecological consequences of physiological characteristics observed in Antarctic phytoplankton under current and future climate scenarios. Outreach will include participation in Stanford's Summer Program for Professional Development for Science Teachers, Stanford's School of Earth Sciences high school internship program, and development of curriculum for local science training centers, including the Chabot Space and Science Center."

First, observation of successful stem cell differentiation to cardiac myocytes is facilitated by readily identifiable immunohistochemical markers as well as characteristic electrical action potentials and mechanical contractions. Second, explanted cells in culture lose their morphology and organization in the absence of drugs or electromechanical stimulation, suggesting that cellular organization is dependent on these cues. Last, myocardium damaged during a heart attack does not regenerate and the weakened muscle results in heart failure. Fundamental understanding of how cardiac myocytes and heart tissue can be regenerated is essential to creating successful therapies for patients with heart disease (affecting 71 million Americans). Recently, several studies have shown that stem cells may offer regenerative potential through direct injection of cells into the damaged myocardium or in situ repair using engineered tissue grafts.    The Intellectual Merit of this project lies in the development of basic knowledge and models for cell response to environmental cues. Pluripotent cell responses to changes in environment offer a testbed for characterizing the thresholds and mechanisms of environmental adaptation and remodeling. The outcomes of the baseline and coupled experiments will be made available as a database for other researchers. Models and results will be disseminated by publication and seminars for researchers in the field as well as public seminar forums.

Dilution and biochemical reactions control the quality of water in the subsurface, in the sediment of beaches or riverbeds, at groundwater recharge basins, etc. For example, a contaminant plume emanating from a source is gradually diminished through   dilution and through chemical reactions in the interior or at the edges of the plume. The success of projects of engineered in-situ remediation often depends on the effectiveness of chemical delivery and mixing of additives, which stimulate native microorganisms to break down contaminants. Equally important to the mixing of reactants may be the removal of   reaction products which, if they remain, inhibit reactions because they are deleterious to the microorganisms.     Many biochemical reactions that are important in the study of environmental processes are very fast in comparison to transport processes, like advection, diffusion, and mass exchange between aqueous and solid zones. Mixing in porous media is very slow and, thus, is usually the mechanism that controls rates. Reaction rates at scales of interest in practical applications are usually controlled by the rates of transport and mixing within geologic formations, rather than by the rates measured in small and completely mixed reactors. Numerical transport-reaction simulation models are invaluable in describing field-scale processes but there are widespread concerns about their effectiveness, the physical significance of the mathematical expressions and parameters that they employ to describe reaction kinetics, or the extent that   these expressions or parameters can be transferred to other sites, or be scaled to sites of different size.     This research is a critical reexamination of the fundamentals of transport-limited reactions in order to identify underlying mechanisms and to develop insights into the applicability of commonly used mathematical expressions, appropriate values of parameters, and the importance of scale effects. Existing approaches are revisited and novel approaches are proposed and tested. A new approach is proposed based on the premise that existing   parameters like dispersion coefficients or mass-transfer coefficients are inadequate, and occasionally ill-suited, for describing the kinetics of reactions that are controlled by hydrologic transport. Alternative quantities need to be considered, measured, and studied with respect to changes in scale. One approach, which constitutes a drastic departure from available procedures, is based on a rigorous derivation of mixing potentials, which quantify   transport-controlled reactions and determine their rates. Critical questions include: what practical tests to perform in the field, how to interpret the results, what accuracy or reliability are practically feasible, and risk-assessment implications.     The applicability of various approached is evaluated by examining specific problems from recently completed field studies and experiments and by performing laboratory experiments and detailed numerical simulations."

Seismological observations provide detailed descriptions of this most remote region in our planet, but interpretations of the many enigmatic seismic features await in-depth understanding of the mineral physics of iron and iron-rich compounds at extreme pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions where in-situ measurements are challenging. This project takes advantage of recent advances in high pressure synchrotron x-ray technology, pushes the envelope of current experimental capabilities, and integrates multiple in-situ probes in order to measure key properties and address fundamental geophysical questions surrounding the Earth?s core and D? layer. The experiments focus on taking an integrated approach in determining the high P-T elasticity of iron and iron-rich silicates. For iron, the equation of state, aggregate compressional and shear wave velocities, velocity anisotropy and lattice preferred orientation, and elastic tensor will be determined in-situ in a diamond anvil cell using a suite of complementary synchrotron x-ray techniques: hydrostatic x-ray diffraction (XRD), radial XRD, nuclear-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, and phonon inelastic x-ray scattering. The results will address major issues such as inner core seismic anisotropy and will establish a benchmark for pure iron for constraint of theoretical calculations and comparison with iron alloys. For the core-mantle boundary, this project focuses on the elasticity of iron-bearing silicate post-perovskite.  Although the significance of the discovery of silicate ppv at D? conditions is well recognized, due to experimental challenges, the amount of data on the properties of silicate post-pervoskite has been scarce. In-situ high P-T radial XRD measurements will be applied to this phase to provide the experimental foundation for understanding the unusual characteristics of the Earth?s D? layer, including the sharp discontinuity at the top of this layer, its lateral velocity variations, its seismic anisotropy, its VP-VS anti-correlation, and its ultralow-velocity zones."

In  collaboration with Zeev Rudnick, the investigator is developing methods  to obtain lower bounds in many families of L-functions.  These lower   bounds are of the same order of magnitude as the conjectured  asymptotic formulae of Keating and Snaith.

Recently released results from the first season of observations (2005) improve any previous results obtained by individual small angular scale experiments. A second successful season of data taking (2006) is now complete and data are in an advanced state of the analysis. The third observational season (2007) just completed and the data are undergoing initial checks, characterization of ground spillover and mitigation of its effects by appropriate filters in Fourier space. As processed and analyzed, these data will produce most precise measurements of the CMB polarization spectra in the multipoles range 200-2000. This will permit a detailed test of whether scalar fluctuations in the early Universe were adiabatic as predicted by the simplest inflationary models, or whether there were significant amounts of isocurvature fluctuations. QUaD also serves as a pathfinder for many of the modern observational techniques that will be needed by future experiments, probing systematic effects that must be confronted in the quest to detect the faint polarization signature from tensor modes."

This research project examines two types of such representations: 1) virtual humans that behave like a specific individual but looks different from that individual on a specific dimension, and 2) virtual humans that look like a specific individual but perform some novel action which that individual has never done.  In the first category, pilot work has demonstrated that people's behavior conforms to the visual features of their representations.  In the second category, pilot work has demonstrated that people model the behavior of digital representations more when the representation looks like them than when it does not.  The current project explores the strength, duration, and processes behind this effect in terms of interactivity.  Specifically, the project will develop the technical aspects of making oneself appear to change in real-time?get older, younger, taller, more attractive, as well as the psychological implications of seeing oneself change shape or social category.  This work is risky because a) it is unclear if a human will respond in a natural way to an altered version of the self, b) the computer algorithms that take a three-dimensional face modeled after a specific user have never been tested in terms of changing the age, gender, and attractiveness of a specific face, and c) no researchers have ever tested the implications of being in virtual reality weeks after the exposure to a digital model.    Humans have relied upon abstract representations of themselves for centuries?painted portraits and statues have been one of the cornerstones of historical art.  However in the digital age, representations are much more dynamic and transformable than their physical counterparts.   Given that a substantial portion of the population are spending literally hours per day interacting via digital representations (e.g., voices on cell phones, characters in online games, profiles on social network web sites such as Facebook), understanding the ramifications of this phenomenon is crucial.  For example, how long do the effects last, and what parameters contribute (e.g., interactivity, similarity, etc.) most?  The current proposal has the potential to change the way we think about the implications of interacting with online versions of one another, and consequently relates to the fields of communication, psychology, education, and computer science.  In sum, in the world in which people have identities in digital space, understanding how those digital representations relate to the physical self is paramount."

This emerging area was proclaimed by experts at the USEPA-sponsored Pellston-style workshop on microbial pollution in Spring 2007 as one of the most important to pursue in the next 2-5 years. The research team expects to make major strides toward establishing a framework for evaluating sources of microbial pollutants in tropical waters and will establish the use of a new source tracking tool.     The study area, Hanalei Bay, located on the North Shore of Kauai, is one of the top five tourist beaches in the U.S. The Bay's beneficial uses include fishing, swimming, surfing, and boating. Hanalei Bay has the worst microbial water quality in the state of Hawaii, according to the National Resources Defense Council; 43% of the water samples taken in the bay near the mouth of the Hanalei River (an American Heritage River) in 2005 were in violation of water quality criteria.  Preliminary research in Hanalei Bay suggests that humans contribute to microbial pollution in the bay. This is not surprising inasmuch as the community relies exclusively on septic systems and cesspools for wastewater disposal. The bay represents an ideal environmental to test and showcase new tools and methods for assessing human contributions of microbial pollution to tropical waters.     The project will feature a tiered approach to microbial source tracking using novel tools developed as part of the proposed work and at PRCMB. In the first tier, the team will characterize near shore water quality in Hanalei Bay and identify potential sources near the bay using microbial indicators. This will yield insight into the physical and biological controls on the abundance and distribution of microbial pollution in the Bay and will identify regional scale predictors of unsafe conditions. In the second tier, they will use source tracking tools as well as assays for human pathogens to determine if microbial pollutants are from a human source or represent a human health risk.   The centerpiece of the project will be the development of a novel esp gene source tracking assay and the testing of its validity for tracking human enterococci in tropical marine waters. In addition, Vibrio and enterococci isolates obtained during the work will be added to the investigators' culture collections for further genetic characterizations using comparative genetic techniques.     In addition to the obvious broader impacts that this research could have on the study of human health - water quality issues in tropical marine settings, it would also provide some support for graduate student participation."

In the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, three signaling pathways have been identified that delay cell division or shift the division site when DNA replication is inhibited. A fourth signaling pathway mediated by the checkpoint protein Sda delays sporulation, a developmental response to nutrient limitation, when DNA replication is perturbed. Preliminary data show that blocking replication elongation induces a starvation-like signal and that the Sda checkpoint prevents cells from inappropriately responding to replication stress as though they were starving. Hypothesis-based approaches are being used to identify the starvation-like signal and to determine how it is generated by replication stress. These studies will lay the foundation for asking if the physiological response occurs in other organisms and if checkpoints analogous to Sda are important for competitive fitness in stressful and changing environments. The second aim of this project is to identify genes that are required to prevent cells from dividing over unsegregated chromosomes (\"nucleoid bisection\") when DNA replication is inhibited. Mutant cells lacking the three known replication checkpoints often delay cell division or shift the division site when DNA replication is perturbed, suggesting that there is at least one more checkpoint pathway. Several new genes required to prevent nucleoid bisection during replication stress have been identified using genetic and bioinformatics approaches. Two encode enzymes, one of which directly or indirectly inhibits cell division in the presence but not the absence of replication stress. These early results suggest that cell cycle progression may be subject to metabolic regulation in ways that are only now being identified. Replication checkpoints and the cellular response to replication stress are often studied at the level of 'information processing', asking how cells monitor DNA replication to stably maintain genetic information. This project broadens the question and is aimed at developing an integrated view of how cellular information processing and metabolism are interconnected. The PI has developed a teaching program that synergizes well with the questions addressed in these studies, generating excitement and fresh ideas in both the classroom and the laboratory. The courses focus on student developing in the areas of problem solving skills, critical and independent thinking, and formulating clear arguments for presentation. The mentoring of undergraduate and Ph.D. students is a key component of the research program, and students have regular opportunities to present their work at seminars and meetings."

The first component advances the understanding of the importance of gender in the macroeconomic context.  The research is motivated by several observations pointing towards the importance of taking women as decision-makers seriously: (1) the fact that women's rights and GDP are highly correlated across countries.  (2) The fact there are more women infected with HIV than men in Sub-Saharan African countries, contrary to the US and Western Europe where HIV is a largely male phenomenon.  (3) The fact that fertility and income are negatively correlated in the cross-section, but that fertility gaps become smaller as a country grows richer.  The project sheds light on these observations by compiling new evidence from legal and historical sources, developing new hypotheses, and formulating the theories as mathematical models.  One such novel theory is that the extension of legal rights to women in the United States during the 19th Century was largely driven by the increased importance of human capital during this time period.  Giving women more decision-making power in the family can increase investment in children's human capital and thereby accelerate the growth rate in a country.  Understanding the historical evolution of women's rights will be important for anyone interested in the position of women in developing countries today.  The work on HIV explores new theories on how decisions about risky sexual behavior are made.  The numerical simulations analyze several possible interventions and thereby provide some guidance to policy-makers.  The general equilibrium models allow the incorporation of feedback effects (for example that a decrease in the infection risk through circumcision may lead to more sexual activity and hence possibly a larger prevalence rate and thus a higher infection risk) which are crucial for the success of a given policy but have been largely ignored in the literature so far.   The second component analyzes changes in consumer credit markets in the United States over the last three decades.  Incorporating default as an option into life-cycle models of consumption and saving behavior allows a quantitative analysis of consumer bankruptcies-which have been on the rise since the early 1980s.  In 1996, the annual number of personal bankruptcies crossed the 1 million threshold, which led to an extensive policy-debate and in fact to a change of the law in 2005.  The research investigates to what extent technological innovation in the financial sector may have contributed to this rise.  The work provides a new theoretical framework to analyze declines in the cost of credit contracts, which allows for a more thorough understanding of which consumers benefited from the rapid expansion of credit cards.  The empirical part of the project sheds new light on changes in the distribution of access to credit and interest rates faced by different consumers.  Several new facts emerge (such as a substantial flattening of the interest rate distribution), which will be an important ingredient into future models of consumer credit.  These findings are also expected to shape the policy debate about regulation of the consumer credit market."

Emotional appeals pervade advertising, marketing, and politics. While some of these appeals convey relevant information about associated products or messages, others feature apparently unrelated items (e.g., a fashion model near a sports car). From the viewpoint of a strictly rational actor, if these unrelated emotional stimuli provide no useful additional information, they should not influence decisions related to the product or message under consideration. Yet, particularly in situations involving minimal reflective processing, researchers have demonstrated that incidental emotional stimuli may influence attitudes and even behavior. However, little is known about the physiological underpinnings, the timecourse, the specificity, or the limits of this potential influence. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Brian Knutson and colleagues at Stanford University will investigate how emotions that occur during anticipation of outcomes (i.e., \"anticipatory affect\") influence financial risk taking. Using behavioral testing and brain imagining techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging), the investigators will test a model of anticipatory affect that predicts that: (1) positive arousal (e.g., \"excitement\") promotes risk seeking; (2) negative arousal (e.g., \"anxiety\") promotes risk aversion; and (3) anticipatory affect has a stronger influence on financial risk taking when cognitive reflection is minimal.     Findings from these studies will integrate cognitive and affective neuroscience, inform decision theory, and advance neuroimaging methods for testing causal models. By advancing scientific understanding of human decision making, the findings may eventually inform policy related to decision making in financial, health, and welfare domains. Understanding how emotions guide decisions is important for accurate models of consumer spending, understanding the phenomenon of popular fads, and has the potential to provide insight into compulsive shopping or gambling.  The studies will engage a diverse group of interdisciplinary students ranging from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows, providing them with skills that will promote their future research expertise and development."

This heterogeneity can provide useful information with regard to important cellular processes, especially if a significant number of cells display a marked deviation from that of average-cell behavior. This research project will be to develop single-cell analysis technology on a microfluidic platform to study the phycobilisome (PBS) degradation process of a unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus. With the single-molecule detection, very low copy numbers of fluorescent molecules can be directly counted from a single-cell lysate, which is the case for bleached cyanobacteria cells. These tools will be used to understand the biochemical mechanism of PBS degradation at the single-cell level.    Broader Impacts  This project will have a significant impact on many different areas of research. First, the biological insight gained from this research will illuminate a new way of viewing ecological diversity, microbiology, and the interrelationship between them. Second, single-cell technology will be advanced toward the integration of cell culture, isolation and manipulation of cells, and the analysis of intracellular contents (both proteins and nucleic acids). With this integrative approach, it should be possible to obtain accurate biochemical information from individual cells as well as simple phenotypic changes. This strategy can be extended to other types of cells and should provide a new paradigm for studying biological heterogeneity. Third, this project is interdisciplinary in essence, involving chemical analysis with biological outcomes. This combination should induce a synergistic conversation between many fields, including ecology, population biology, and biophysical chemistry, resulting in more productive directions and motivations for future research. Fourth, there will be a strong component of teaching and training both at the undergraduate and graduate level as well as annual multidisciplinary workshops to introduce participants to the potential uses of single-cell technology in biology."

It does this by reconstructing the international networks of scholarly exchange in which this new field of inquiry arose, and by identifying the major cultural, intellectual, religious and political forces that shaped its methods, content, and goals. One of its major contributions will be to revisit this important period in the development of the earth sciences by taking seriously the apocalypticism of some of its key practitioners. Historians have long noted the preoccupation with Noah's flood which many early geologists displayed, but little attention has been paid to the fact that future catastrophes, usually imagined as apocalyptic in character or significance, were also a topic of interest and debate. Recognizing that it was then a live question whether the earth's future was a legitimate topic of natural inquiry significantly reorients the way that scholars currently understand the historical development of the earth sciences as well as the historical relationship between science and religion. Understanding why the flood became a legitimate object of geological investigation while the apocalypse did not will shed light on the process by which people tried, and sometimes failed, to bring various phenomena under the purview of the natural sciences in the early modern period. Pursuing the question of how and why certain things were 'naturalized' while others were not tallies with the question of how new scientific disciplines were constituted. Towards that end, this project seeks to reconstruct how local conversations across Europe (and Europe's colonies) merged into a largely unified, international discipline in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, discussing individuals both famous and obscure, and employing new evidence and new analytic approaches to gain a fresh perspective on an old story.    Natural disasters, real and imagined, were and remain objects of fascination for scientists and laymen alike. They are often charged with religious meaning in addition to, and often in competition with, the meaning assigned to them in the natural sciences. They are often interpreted in political ways as well. This study, which focuses on the science of disaster at a key moment of disciplinary configuration, also seeks to understand why natural disasters carry the set of meanings they do and thus why disasters play out in contemporary culture in they way that they do. Although the project is intended primarily as a contribution to our historical understanding of the scientific culture of early modern Europe, the issues it treats are ones that continue to reverberate in contemporary society. Recent highly-visible natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina have only stirred the controversy surrounding the predictions of future disasters, most notably those associated with the projected effects of global warming. In documenting how and why the prediction of disasters was devalued at a particular point in time, light may be shed on why it continues to be controversial even to this day. Finally, the fraught relationship between science and religion in today's world can only be better understood by an appreciation of the historical roots of that tension."

Today, the greatest hurdles faced by such projects are almost always social and/or political, with their onset often triggering intense public opposition.  However, public opposition does not always occur.  Why?  This project funded by the Science and Society and Sociology programs undertakes a systematic comparative analysis of community response to 30 siting decisions in the United States since 2004.  The analysis identifies the factors and dynamic processes that shape variation in popular opposition to large infrastructure projects.    The intellectual merits of the project include contributions to three sets of research literature in science, technology & society and sociology.  These include: research on social movements, research on the determinants of not-in-my-back-yard (NIMBY) attitudes, and research on the link between public participation and facility siting.  By focusing on responses to siting decisions rather than movements, the project avoids the common tendency of selecting on the dependent variable in movement literature.  Much can be learned from cases where little public opposition occurs just as it can from cases where opposition is strong.  The project also explores the link between movement mobilization and technical factors, the latter of which are often ignored in social movement research.  Finally, through the use of Charles Ragin's method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis, the study combines the richness of case studies with the inferential possibilities of \"large N\" studies.    The project has broader impacts in its involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the research process.  It also provides insights for policy-making related to infrastructure siting, and for stakeholders involved in such future conflicts.  Since the country's infrastructure needs are growing, this research provides knowledge about what features of these projects stimulate community opposition and what procedures help to mitigate citizen concerns."

At the graduate level, under-representation among minority groups is even more striking than at the undergraduate level; for example, African Americans comprised fewer than nine percent of graduate school enrollments and Hispanics comprised just five percent of graduate school enrollments in the early 21st Century in U.S. universities. Under-representation may even be more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in  terms of population and also two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states. Indeed, both California and Texas are now considered to be \"majority-minority\" population states.     This collaborative renewal project -- which includes proposals  from the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Southern California -- will continue to address the under representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) sciences at these four institutions. The project will continue to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority (URM) graduate students in the SBE Sciences at alliance institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among URM groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences. Two principles continue to guide efforts. Alliance partners will: 1) share ideas, best practices, and resources, and create a network to recruit and retain students for alliance universities; and 2) build on successful initiatives that have already been developed on each of the campuses so that efforts can be as cost-effective and successful as possible.   Highly collaborative and innovative methods will be used to improve efforts in recruiting and retaining minority graduate students at the institutions.       Broader Impact     The broader impact of this program is to influence the future of higher education in both  California and Texas. The future of higher education in these two critical majority-minority states in part depends on the ability of universities in these states to diversify the racial/ethnic mix of faculty.

The project will involve deciphering Arsenic migration pathways within the Mekong Delta in Cambodia.  Arsenic, a toxic and carcinogenic metalloid found throughout the earth's crust, is adversely affecting millions of individuals worldwide.  Many individuals in Southeast Asia are exposed to drinking water contaminated with arsenic.  Despite the widespread poisoning and resulting attention on subsurface arsenic sources, biophysicochemical processes leading to Arsenic groundwater remain unresolved.  The researchers propose to define the processes responsible for releasing Arsenic into the aqueous phase within the sedimentary basins of Southeast Asia.  The Mekong Delta of Cambodia will serve as a model system for the study.  In accomplishing this project they will utilize a suite of field measurements, intact core leaching experiments, and sediment incubations with native microbial communities.  Once completed, they will provide a specific illustration of arsenic release and transport within sediments, which will constrain predictions of where Arsenic is a problem contaminant.  Such predictions are desperately needed to combat the current health crisis associated with the widespread ingestion of arsenic contaminated waters, especially in the developing nations of Southeast Asia.     The results of this study will provide a mechanistic description of Arsenic release from near-surface tropical sediments, inclusive of relevant biological, chemical, and hydrologic processes.  The biochemical conditions with sediments conductive to Arsenic release will be constrained, and this disseminated information will be used to better predict locations which may be at higher risk of elevated Arsenic concentrations within Southeast Asia.  The project will train the U.S. graduate student, as well as some young Cambodian scientists, to acquire and analyze field data, adding to the intellectual base now depleted by many years of the civil war.  The project will also provide the U.S. graduate student with a global research experience.  It is anticipated that the student will maintain scientific connections with his Cambodian collaborators for many years after the project is completed."

Several factors have fundamentally changed the mating market in the past 50 years in ways that require a new, in-depth study of how people meet their mates. First, Americans are now marrying later than ever before. Second, the life course of young adulthood is now a more complex and winding road including travel away from home and college education. Third, the types of families young adults form seem to be changing- witness the rise of interracial marriage and same-sex unions. Fourth, new technologies such as the Internet provide new ways of meeting romantic partners. Fifth, research from Europe suggests that recent marriage cohorts have met in different ways from their parents and grandparents.  This project gathers new nationally representative data on how couples meet. The survey of couple formation includes detailed questions about when, where, and how couples met, and what social connections or institutions (such as family, school, or work) brought them together. The study of how couples meet will be followed by one and two year follow-ups with all couples identified in the initial study. The first study will provide data on different types of couples and how they met (for example: through the Internet, through family connections, through church, or through work). The follow-up studies will determine couple dissolution rates (i.e., breakup rates).  The data on couple dissolution will enable scholars to determine how legal status (civil unions, for example) affects couple stability for same-sex couples.    The study will collect  new information not only on how couples meet, but also on the question of whether couple dissolution rates vary by how couples meet.  These data will be publicly  available through ICPSR (Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research) and Stanford University website.."

This expression reflects the recognition that decision-makers who must justify their decisions to others have an easier time defending that decision if they can say that they did what ?most people? would have done?i.e., favored the high-status option. Yet while research in economic sociology has documented such an effect, research on status in social psychology has shown what appears to be the opposite pattern, whereby accountability dampens biases in favor of status characteristics such as gender or race. With this background in mind, the intellectual merits of the proposed project are that it: 1) develops and tests a new theoretical analysis of the role of accountability in status processes that advances our understanding of important social inequality processes; 2) integrates two previously separate and seemingly contradictory strands of research on accountability and status biases. The key to this reconciliation involves recognizing that accountability is constitutive of status because status not only signals ?quality? but also acts as a social coordination device by which people align their behavior in relation to others. Insofar as a decision-maker feels dependent on audience approval but knows only that the audience is aware of the status structure, it is rational for a decision-maker to favor high-status options even when the decision-maker personally does not endorse them. But insofar as the decision-maker: believes or suspects that the audience holds unconventional beliefs (e.g., that gender and race biases are illegitimate), the bias towards high status options will be reduced.     Two experiments will test hypotheses about the conditions under which accountability produces biases in favor of high status options and those in which it suppresses such biases. The first experiment employs a consumer product choice decision following economic sociology. The second involves the assessment of applicant files for hiring similar to social psychological research. Conditions within each experiment manipulate the decision maker?s sense of the audience for his of her decision so that, for both consumer choice and hiring recommendations, we predict high status favoritism in one condition while we expect such favoritism to be suppressed in other conditions.     The project has several broader impacts. First it has the potential to inform policies aimed at reducing workplace discrimination against women and minorities by increasing accountability. This project suggests that the positive effects of accountability will only be realized in an environment that can effectively override conventional beliefs and replace them with specific beliefs in the local environment that decouple the association of status and quality. Second, the project will contribute to the infrastructure of science by providing graduate students and several undergraduates at two universities with first hand training and experience in the conduct of social research. Third, from past experience, the PIs expect that up to half of the graduates and undergraduates will be women and racial/ethnic minorities. Such experiences increase the likelihood that these students will pursue scientific careers."

A source of the success of microfinance in successfully making loans to the poor (in contrast to the failures of previous government-sponsored subsidized credit schemes) is its reliance on the local social network. Loans are often given to group of five to ten women who are jointly liable for the loan to the group. The social networks are harnessed to diffuse information about micro-finance, screen out bad borrowers, and provide monitoring.     The goal of this proposal is to examine in more details, both theoretically and empirically, how the social network structure impacts the diffusion of membership in a microfinance organization. To this end, we will collect very detailed information on social ties between villagers in 50 villages where a specific microfinance institution (BSS, in Karnataka) is planning to start work in the next few months. We will also collect information on specific features of the villages (such as geographical features) which may be a source of exogenous variation in the structure of these networks. As BSS expands, the BSS credit department will share information on those who become members, on how groups are formed, and on the performance of the groups (repayment, drop out, meeting attendance, etc.). This information will be matched with the social network survey, allowing us to map the diffusion of microfinance both along networks within a village and across villages, depending on the type and shape of networks present in the village.    We will use this information to answer several important questions on the role of social networks in Microfinance: First, what is the impact of the structure of the network on the way microfinance diffuses? Second does it matter that some specific members of the network join early? Third, does microfinance exclude some people who are not central to the social network? Fourth, are individuals who have more connections also more reliable borrowers? To frame these questions, we will rely on existing theoretical results on the impact of social network structure on the diffusion of information which have been contributed by some of the PIs on this proposal. We will also develop new results to shed light on issues that have not yet been explored theoretically.     The project has scientific and practical implications. At the scientific level, microfinance, which relies on social networks both to spread information as well as a basis for effective functioning is an interesting area for testing some of the modern theory of networks. At the practical level, microfinance has been widely heralded as one of the effective ways to harness social networks to reach the poor with credit. But little is known on how variations in social networks across villages impact the ability of microfinance organizations to spread in villages, their tendency to exclude or include some pockets of the population, and how effectively they function. Answers to those questions can lead to important practical advice for microfinance practitioners and for policy makers who are concerned that microfinance could exclude socially marginalized populations."

Interest in psychological approaches to economic questions has grown in recent years, stimulated largely by accumulating evidence that the standard economic model of consumer decision-making may provide an inadequate description of human behavior.  \"Behavioral\" economic theories that incorporate non-standard components (motivated by psychological evidence) are increasingly finding their way into policy evaluation, which inevitably involves what economists call \"welfare analysis\" (that is, assessments of well-being). Yet these new theories fundamentally challenge our ability to formulate appropriate criteria for judging whether outcomes are \"good\" or \"bad.\"  If, contrary to the traditional assumption in economics, an individual's choices do not reflect coherent preferences, how can those choices provide economists with a basis for judging whether one outcome is better than another?    This project develops, applies, and refines a unified framework for policy evaluation that encompasses the new generation of behavioral economic theories.  The framework developed here is a natural extension of standard welfare economics.  The standard approach is based on choice.  In its simplest form, it advises a policy maker to respect the choices an individual would make for himself.  The guiding principle behind that approach is an extension of the libertarian deference to freedom of choice, which takes the view that it is better to give a person the thing he would choose for himself rather than something that someone else would choose for him.      The central premise of this project is that the same principle remains applicable even when people behave in ways that are inconsistent with standard economic assumptions.  Although the guidance provided by people's choices may be ambiguous in some circumstances, it is typically unambiguous in others, and this partially ambiguous guidance can provide a foundation for rigorous policy evaluation.  The project develops a general framework for policy evaluation and explores its implications for particular behavioral theories.  It also reexamines an assortment of public policies, employing generalizations of the standard tools that economists conventionally use when evaluating the desirability of public policies.      The broader impact of this work will follow directly from its focus on developing appropriate criteria for evaluating public policies.  Previous studies that have employed non-standard behavioral models in the context of public policy analysis have generally relied on ad hoc criteria for assessing the relative desirability of different outcomes. This project will revisit many of those policy issues, such as the design of capital income taxes and social security, to identify conclusions that are rigorously justified based on the application of the new framework.  In addition, this work enables greater integration of economics, psychology, and neuroscience.  Specifically, it allows economists to conduct rigorous welfare analysis using literally any model of behavior, including ones imported from other fields, regardless of whether those models depict behavior as reflecting optimization."

The project develops new mathematical and statistical models to understand divisible good auctions.  This kind of auction is typically employed to sell treasury bills or other government securities, electricity, and shares in initial public offerings (IPOs).  Since about $4 trillion worth of treasury bills alone are sold annually worldwide, these auction mechanisms affect very important markets. All of these auctions share the common feature that bidders' strategies (bids) are restricted to take a particular form. In particular, they have to be characterized by a finite (and usually quite small) number of price-quantity pairs, which together describe the bid function (or demand function). This institutional feature of bids, which has been to a large extent ignored in the previous literature, has important implications for the performance of auction mechanisms. This project offers a new theory for auctions with constrained bidding and applies it on data from two different settings: treasury bill auctions of the Czech and Canadian governments respectively.    In the first application, this project analyzes treasury auction data from the Czech Republic.  This country uses a uniform price auction format, which means that all bidders pay the same market clearing price for all treasury bills they win. This research offers a new method for recovering bidders' valuations from data on bids and using these estimates it demonstrates that ignoring the restrictions on the bidding strategies could lead to important problems when conducting counterfactuals or evaluating the performance of the auction mechanism.    In the second empirical application the project considers a novel statistical test for deciding between models with private and common values. In a model with private values, a bidder's own valuation for the auctioned good is independent of the information of his opponents. When values are common, on the other hand, a bidder's valuation might depend on rivals' private information. The test is applied to data from treasury auctions of the Canadian government, which have a discriminatory auction format, which means that every bidder has to pay his full bid for every treasury bill she wins. The results suggest that a private value model is appropriate in the case of 3-months treasury bills, but not for 12-months treasury bills. This research also analyzes the value of information that large primary dealers derive from customers' order flow and finds that this source of profits accounts for a significant share of primary dealer's overall profits in these treasury bill auctions.    The broader impacts of this research will benefit practitioners deciding on auction rules and how to design or adjust the institutional settings to improve auction performance. I"

In addition to the network data, the researcher will collect information about the marginalized population's histories, the forces influencing their decisions to engage in dangerous work, and how these forces have been influenced by the massive transformations stemming from China's neoliberalism since the late 1970s. Among these forces are socioeconomic environments, the political economy, personal networks, as well as state policies. 	    The project's methodological contribution comes from deploying new techniques for identifying the properties of cluster boundaries and illustrating the social space of hidden populations. This ethnographic application of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) in China may ultimately become the prototype for applying RDS in studying other hidden or sensitive populations.     The research data will be used as empirically grounded parameters to drive mathematical models for epidemiological purposes. These research results will ultimately benefit marginalized people at risk as well as populations at large."

The low cost and small size of these accelerometers enables creation of an inexpensive, dense network that supplements existing seismic networks in the Greater Los Angeles Basin. The network also provides an inexpensive vehicle for promoting geoscience education within K-12 classrooms that provides students with the opportunity to conduct hands-on, inquiry-based investigations.  Networking is achieved through the use of the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) distributed software processing package, which allows, when combined with the sensor acquisition software, ultra-efficient processing, transfer, and analysis of the seismic data.  Volunteers monitoring the accelerometers send small data packets to the central server when strong new motions are detected; waveform data only uploads when an earthquake is confirmed. This planning grant is being used to finish development of the platform independent version of the QCN computing software; increase the number of volunteers in the network through outreach; complete development of interactive software for use within K-12 classrooms; distribute 200 USB accelerometers and educational materials to K-12 schools; and evaluate data contributed through the network."

The relationship between violent conflict and the nature and timing of significant life history events, such as marriage, migration, and childbirth, remains poorly understood. Empirical studies of behavior and culture in low sex-ratio settings are scarce, yet these are precisely the demographic conditions expected to prevail in situations of violent conflict worldwide. Furthermore, theory and evidence demonstrate that unbalanced sex ratios resulting from excess male death carry substantial implications with respect to intrafamiliar power relations, levels of parental investment, and childrearing practices.     The researcher will combine existing demographic data from government registries, household surveys, and other sources with original ethnographic research in Colombia. The research will proceed in three phases: (1) collection of demographic data, (2) focused ethnographic research, and (3) the development of formal models of the life course, the predictions of which will be evaluated with respect to both measured values from the representative demographic and survey data and individual stated preferences. By integrating semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and formal demographic techniques into a common life history approach, the project will examine the objective and perceived ways in which community violence conditions certain individual decisions and behaviors made over the life course.     As the first study of its kind in a largely industrialized society afflicted by chronic civil strife, the findings will deepen our understanding of the humanitarian impacts of civil violence and generate a range of practical insights relevant to the design and implementation of effective social policies in Colombia.

This research effort is directed at interfacial and bulk flow processing methods that are able to control the orientation and morphology of these materials. It is demonstrated that this control of microstructure has important consequences on the behavior of human cells that are grown on the surfaces of these proteins. Interfacial flow processing methods will be investigated as a means of manipulating the orientation of collagen fibrils. In the case of silk fibroin, these techniques will be used to systematically vary the degree of crystallization and orientation of the crystalline morphology of this protein. Confinement of these proteins to an interface strongly facilitates intermolecular interactions and self assembly, and offers important advantages for flow-induced manipulation of microstructure. The second method that will be used to manipulate microstructure is the application of hydrodynamic forces to these materials from the liquid crystalline state. In the case of collagen, cholesteric phases can be achieved and flow processes are able to create remarkable structures through flow banding. These bands also appear to control cell growth. The experimental methods that will be applied to these systems include interfacial rheology to measure the surface moduli of these layers, dichroism measurements to determine flow-induced orientational order, the measurement of interfacial isotherms, and surface x-ray diffraction and reflectivity. The proposal includes preliminary data acquired using these techniques that reveal our ability to effectively create important, new morphologies with these fibrous proteins.    The project has an REU and RET aspect.    Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity:    Although this research effort is not a program in tissue engineering, its results are expected to be very relevant to this broad area. In particular, it is known that the morphology of substrate microstructure has a strong influence on the subsequent shape, size, and proliferation of cells that grow on them. Two graduate students in chemical engineering will be trained in subjects that include interfacial thermodynamics, interfacial fluid mechanics, rheology (bulk and interfacial), the culturing of cells, and an array of characterization techniques (interfacial rheology, dichroism and Brewster angle microscopy, and x-ray scattering).

All these efforts have as their goal the increased performance of Advanced LIGO.     Gravitational waves were predicted almost 90 years ago in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, but they have not yet been detected due to the extreme sensitivity required. Interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary stellar systems, stellar collapses, pulsars and low mass X-ray binaries are all possible sources of gravitational waves, as is the random background of radiation from the early universe. Laser interferometer detectors, which operate by measuring strains in the fabric of space-time that are expected to be produced by gravitational waves, are now becoming operational and may soon give us a first detection. Detectors of higher performance, such as Advanced LIGO, should allow us to develop gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe. Stanford has a strong, multidisciplinary program in developing the technology for such detectors with participants from many areas of physics and engineering.

The main thrust of the research undertaken here is the effort at  theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors of interacting electrons (i.e. new states of matter) as well as new regimes of parameters in which familiar states of matter behave in new and different ways. In addition, some of the research explores qualitatively the relation between the microscopic interactions between electrons and the effective parameters that control the macroscopic behavior of solids.    The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work is based on an analogy between classical liquid crystals and corresponding phases of strongly interacting electrons.  Electronic liquid crystals are quantum states with behaviors intermediate between a Fermi liquid and a Wigner crystal. Examples of such states have recently been observed experimentally: the anisotropic states (quantum Hall nematics) that are seen in high mobility quantum Hall devices and the metamagnetic nematic phase that has recently been identified in Sr3Ru2O7.     The more microscopic issues to be addressed involve the physics of the superconducting Tc. A number of questions are addressed theoretically.  What is it about superconductivity that causes transition temperatures, generally, to be so low, while other orders, such as ferromagnetism, frequently onset at much higher temperatures? Why is there, in the cuprate high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' doping at which Tc is maximal ? what is there an excess of in ''overdoped'' cuprates? Are there optimal mesoscale structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance the strength of the electron pairing without too strongly suppressing the superfluid stiffness? The research also seeks to interpret the importance of evidence of wide-spread mesoscale inhomogeneities in the cuprates ? both self-organized (i.e. stripes) and nucleated by disorder. The research is motivated by a need to clarify  whether these observations are complicating details or essential to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.    The effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences. Scientifically, there is impact in extending the understanding of the origins of high temperature superconductivity because that opens new theoretical opportunities as well as providing better ability to design materials with this highly desirable property.  Involving students and postdoctoral researchers in the diverse   problems and theoretical techniques used  provides an exceptional training for talented young people. Past students and postdoctoral researchers have gone on to university faculty positions and their own careers in teaching and research and some have found successful positions in high tech companies and a variety of other fields outside of mainstream physics.    NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This award supports research and education on exotic properties and unexplained electronic states  of unusual materials. The broad thrust of the research undertaken here is the theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors and new states of matter as well as investigating how familiar forms matter can be made to behave in new and different ways. This research explores these unusual states of matter by looking at the behavior of electrons and the microscopic level of the atoms that make up the material and then connecting those behaviors with the large scale properties which are seen in the material as a solid whole.    The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work develops theories of why some materials have electrons that are not just quiescently distributed more or less uniformly but which instead group together in various patterns.    The  issues to be addressed also involve the physics of the superconducting materials, those which can conduct electricity with no resistance and thus no waste of energy. The questions are quite basic.  What is it about superconductivity that causes working temperatures, generally, to be so low? Why is there, in some high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' composition at which the working temperature is highest? Are there optimal ways of creating structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance performance? The research is motivated by a need to clarify which experimental  observations are complicating details and which are essential clue to discovering to the mechanism needed to explain high temperature superconductivity.

These algorithms will be developed for a variety of situations where one seeks to partition a region, such as redistricting, drawing organ transplant regions (matches for an organ are first sought within the same region), drawing air traffic control regions (or dynamically adjusting them), and dividing a region among a set of vehicles in order to better surveil/survey the region or serve customers distributed in the region.  In each of these applications, the algorithms will seek to satisfy and/or optimize different criteria.  Redistricting has the criteria that each district contains the same population and optimizes goals such as competitiveness or compactness.  On the other hand, the organ transplant regions should be drawn so that each contains a transplant center and optimizes a combination of efficiency (few organs go to waste) and fairness (people in different regions have roughly equal chances of receiving an organ).  In air traffic control we seek to balance and minimize the work load of the air traffic control regions.  The goal in the vehicle routing problems is to minimize the time until the region is completely surveyed or all the customers have been served.  This grant also funds performance analyses of the developed algorithms in both theory and practice (the algorithms developed for the vehicle problems, for example, will not be optimal since these problems are generalizations of the traveling salesman problem and are thus NP hard).    If successful, this research will lead to fairer, more compact legislative and congressional districts; more efficient and fair organ transplant regions; more efficient and load-balanced air traffic control regions; and improvements in logistics and vehicle routing.  It will also extend the reach of optimization from algebraic and combinatorial problems to geometric ones.  In addition, it will provide a framework and generalize a number of existing problems in computational geometry."

The damage detection algorithms will utilize autoregressive and wavelet based analysis for signal modeling. Damage detection will be achieved by first defining features within signals and then tracking changes in the features using statistical pattern classification methods. Localization and quantification of damage will be addressed by using sensor fusion and feature change statistics correlation to physical damage levels. Algorithm calibration and verification will be performed with data obtained from recent laboratory and field tests. These will include measurements from vibration, strain, temperature, humidity and crack propagation experiments. Sample algorithms will be embedded on microprocessors of existing wireless multi-sensor structural sensing units and utilized in ongoing tests.     The results of this research will greatly increase the capabilities of wireless structural monitoring by providing diagnosis at the local component, subassembly and overall structural levels. Furthermore, the algorithms will significantly reduce the need for direct data transmission and thus reduce data communications rates.

In particular, the proposal deals with a number of fundamental questions regarding the moduli space of curves, deformation theory, the Schubert calculus, Geometric Invariant Theory, Gromov-Witten theory, and fundamental groups.    Algebraic geometry provides a powerful theory with which to define moduli spaces of interesting objects.  Once they are defined, natural compelling questions are: what do they look like?

This encompasses such diverse areas as the study of singularities of solutions of the wave equation, which is the \"nearby\" behavior of waves, as well as the asymptotic behavior of waves on curved space-times, such as in general relativity. The project will employ geometric microlocal techniques to explore new problems in these areas. Some of these techniques are constructive, such as the ones used by the author in the description of the scattering operator on asymptotically de-Sitter-like spaces, and some rely on phase-space energy estimates, such as the microlocal positive commutator estimates employed by the author in the proof of the propagation of singularities on domains with corners and in showing that the wave diffracted by a smooth edge is more regular (which can be interpreted as \"weaker\") than the incident wave under suitable hypotheses, in joint work with Melrose and Wunsch.    Most people are familiar with the following two descriptions of the propagation of light. First, in geometric optics, light propagates in straight lines, reflecting from smooth surfaces according to Snell's law (i.e., the angles of incidence and of reflection are the same, as if light consisted of billiard balls). Second, light can be described by the wave equation, its propagation thus being similar to that of water waves. There is a close relationship between these two viewpoints. Namely, for solutions of the wave equation, the propagation of sharp signals (or \"singularities\" of signals obtained, for example, by turning on light instantaneously) is precisely described by the simpler geometric optics picture. Part of this project can be regarded as an extension of this work to a more general setting, such as reflections from curved edges. As wave propagation is ubiquitous in the physical world, a more precise understanding of it has many potential applications, for instance, to inverse problems. In a material with cracks inside it, one would like to find out the location of these cracks by probing the material with waves (say, sound waves, or x-rays). These cracks are typically not smooth (e.g., they may have edges or corners), but they still fit into our general geometric framework. One can use our proposed results -- namely, that the reflections from the tips of the cracks are weaker (in a certain sense) than the reflections from the smooth parts -- combined with the very precise understanding of reflections from the smooth parts, to locate the cracks. The rough conclusion: the tips can be ignored."

The proposed devices will solve the ever aggravating leakage and static power consumption problem of the CMOS technologies. The approach is to pursue simultaneously the lithography-based top-down processes and the nanowire/carbon nanotube-based bottom-up techniques. The proposed research aligns well with the EPDT program which aims at improving the fundamental understanding of devices and components based on the principles of electronics and electromechanics.   The intellectual merit resides in the experimental realization of extremely low power ULSI logic systems combining two traditionally distinct domains (MEMS and CMOS logic). Micron-sized MEMS devices will be extended into the nanoscale regime. The ultra-low power operation of the proposed devices follows from the fact that the signal propagation is based not only on the movement of charge but also on the displacement of a solid rod. This distinguishes the NEM relays and the NEMS-based transistors from the conventional MOSFETs.   The broader impacts will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics workforce and provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and education, public education, minority student outreach, and promotion of partnerships. Specifically, collaboration with the producers of the award-winning Silicon Run Film Series will result in new educational films on MEMS and nanoelectronics. They will serve as a resource to educators teaching in these new fields and assist with the professional development of instructors in supporting disciplines."

The approach is based on two technical components: (1) a DNA fragment detector with a sensitivity of ~100 femto-molar that is at least 10-fold better than the present technology, and (2) a sample preparation system allowing rapid and efficient concentration of the DNA (or protein) samples. Both components utilize monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles (nanotags) with a mean diameter ranging from 10 to 100 nm to label pathogen targets.  Intellectual Merit   The intellectual merit of the project is that the magnetic biochip allows greater specificity and sensitivity for pathogen detection and quantitation. In particular, the intrinsic multiplexing capability of magnetic DNA chip will create what economists call a ?disruptive? technology.  Because it is cost-effective and easy to use, the magnetic DNA assay can define a new standard of healthcare for infectious diseases.  Broader Impact   The broader impact extends well beyond magnetics, spintronics, nanotechnology, and biology. It will eventually make it possible to detect, and in some cases treat, diseases such as cystic fibrosis, cervical cancer, sickle-cell anemia, and diabetes. The same magnetic chip can be adapted for use in genomics, forensics, biodefense, and cancer detection. The fundamental knowledge of magnetic biosensors and nanoparticles would have wide-ranging implications for micromagnetic and nanomagnetic devices in microelectronics as well as medicine.

Every day people divide and share tasks used to achieve group goals.   However, there are numerous ways goal-oriented tasks may be structured.  Do people work separately or together?  Do they perform the same work tasks or are they responsible for different tasks?  Do all group members have general skills that enable them to take over each other?s tasks or are the skills specialized and known to only a few?  This dissertation studies the conditions under which the division of labor in task structure creates a sense of mutual interdependence, similarity, and joint responsibility versus a sense of separation, difference, and low efficacy between group members.   The research goes beyond the overly-simplified question of whether task differences inhibit or enhance group solidarity to study how group attachment is affected by the way actual tasks are divided amongst group members, this dissertation goes beyond.   The co-PI uses a micro-order approach to study the mechanisms which cause people to bond to immediate social groups by analyzing 1) how task structure affects patterns of interaction within a group and 2) how those patterns of interaction affect person-to-group attachment.  The co-PI will conduct a series of experiments using university students to test of how different types of goal-oriented task structures affect person-to-group bonding.      Broader Impacts    This study has implications for how organizational task structure can affect member attrition rate.  It will provide insights that will help us understand the fine line between motivating people to feel personally responsible and invested in their group and recognizing that people need to value others and understand that they cannot accomplish group work alone.  By examining how task structure influences personal bonding to a group, this dissertation can help organizational planners better understand how they can structure in-group interaction.  Organizations can use information about the effects of task structure to organize their daily work routines in ways that create a balance between cooperative coordination between employees and the desire for individuals to be responsible and self-autonomous at work.  With this type of information, organizations may be able to help their work groups create a stronger sense of group solidarity and cohesion by creating group task structures that best fit the collective needs of their group.  Thus, it is important to study the fine line between when skill specialization and task differentiation solidifies group solidarity and when they erode it."

Such transitions -- where changing an external parameter in the Hamiltonian induces a transition from one quantum ground state to another, fundamentally different one -- have been invoked to understand experimental data in many electronic systems, as well as to analyze more challenging quantum phenomena such as the limitations of quantum computing. A paradigm for quantum phase transitions has been the superconductor to insulator transition in two-dimensional films. This transition is found to have a variety of realizations depending on intrinsic properties of the materials used. Controlling the strength of superconductivity, disorder, or dimensionality of the films will impact the nature of the transition, which is accessed through the variation of external parameters such as temperature and magnetic field. This award supports a project to explore the superconductor to insulator transition in amorphous MgB2 films and multilayers. The uniqueness of this system is the ability to control the strength of superconductivity over a very wide range, control the disorder, and fabricate bilayers and multilayers. However, more uniquely, due to the lightness of both magnesium and boron, spin orbit interaction is probably the lowest that can be achieved in any thin film superconductor, providing us with new opportunities to study its effect on the transition. The proposed work is expected to impact science in several areas including shedding new light on the nature of quantum phase transitions in reduced dimensions, better understanding of the material science of amorphous superconducting films, and the development of new methodologies using novel measurements techniques. The program involves graduate students in this area of great interest to physics and future applications.      Technical Abstract    Studies of the phase diagram of two-dimensional superconductors has been intimately connected to finding new materials. With each materials system a different set of properties is highlighted. Over the years, NSF support enabled the optimization of a variety of materials for studies of thin superconducting films in general and the superconductor to insulator transition (SIT) in particular. These include amorphous-MoGe films that allowed the discovery of \"metallic phases,\" amorphous-InOx films that allowed the studies of the regime of strong disorder, and more recently amorphous- MgB2 films which in addition to the overlap in parameters with MoGe and InOx, also provide a new knob in the form of controlling spin-orbit interaction. A newly available, novel technique to fabricate multilayers of amorphous MgB2/MgO allows further exploration of dimensionality effects. This award supports a project to explore the rich physics this MgB2 model system offers. Experiments will be performed to study SIT in perpendicular magnetic field on MgB2 thin films bilayers of various types (e.g. proximity systems) and multilayers. Specific attention will be given to the effect of quantum melting near the SIT point. The manifestation of low spin-orbit interaction will be explored through measurements in parallel magnetic field searching for signatures of first order transition and irreversibility. In addition to transport measurements, mesoscopic effects near the transition will be explored using novel techniques including scanning tunneling potentiometry and Kerr microscopy. The proposed work is expected shed new light on the nature of quantum phase transitions in reduced dimensions, as well as impact the understanding of the material science of amorphous superconducting films, and the development of new methodologies using novel measurements techniques.

One theme is the search for canonical metrics on the class of compact iterated cone-edge spaces; special low-dimensional cases include a new analysis of Riemann surfaces with conic singularities, and more significantly, some robust deformation results for three dimensional polyhedra in space forms. Closely related is a project to determine the deformation theory of noncompact Einstein spaces modeled on noncompact symmetric spaces of general rank; this is a generalization of the theory of Poincare-Einstein metrics which has played a prominent role in many recent papers in conformal geometry, and also in string theory, where it appears as part of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Another project concerns minimal submanifolds of these Poincare-Einstein spaces, and in particular, in three-dimensional convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds. The goal here is to define and study the variational properties of the renormalized area functional on the space of properly embedded minimal surfaces with embedded asymptotic boundary curves; this seems to be a natural context for studying the Willmore functional from differential geometry for surfaces with boundary. Finally, the PI has also been studying geometric evolution equations on singular spaces. The first case in terms of geometric simplicity is the generalization of the curvature flow from the setting of closed embedded curves to that of networks of curves; the goals are to establish a good existence theory for the flow, to examine questions of nonuniqueness and to prove long-time existence to a Steiner network.    To put this work into a broader context, most work in geometric analysis is in the setting of geometric objects which are smooth, i.e. do not have corners, edges or other singularities.  However, spaces with singularities appear naturally and very frequently in geometry, physics and other applications, and it is natural to try to extend the methods and results of geometric analysis to this broader class of objects. However, the appropriate tools from analysis and partial differential equations do not exist in this generality, so a major part of the work needed is to extend these techniques to spaces with singularities. This has been a major endeavour of the PI throughout his career. The specific problems on which he is now working involve refined questions such as the existence and nature of optimal metrics, or shapes, on these singular spaces, and the study of evolution equations which continuously deform such a space into one of these optimal shapes. On smooth spaces, these questions have been some of the principal directions of research in geometric analysis, but their analogues in this singular setting have not been studied in any systematic way. Another problem involves the study of a renormalized version of the surface area of a class of optimal (minimal) surfaces inside a space with constant negative curvature. This is an action functional which has been studied intensively in string theory.  One final part of this PI's work is of an educational nature: he is the founder and director of a residential summer program (SUMaC), held at his institution each year, which is directed toward highly motivated and talented high school students to encourage their continued study of mathematics. This program is now in its fourteenth year of operation."

In contrast, much less is understood about moduli spaces of higher dimensional complex manifolds.  This is project will investigate what can be said about this and related spaces using methods of homotopy theory.  Another goal of this project is to study moduli spaces of manifolds with singularities.  Here, the most basic case is the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Riemann's moduli space.  For many application this space is more important than the uncompactified moduli space, and a homotopy theoretic understanding should be fruitful.  In particular, the proposer will study applications to Gromov-Witten theory.    A manifold is a general notion of space.  Manifolds are fundamental in geometry, topology, analysis, and other areas of mathematics.  In physics, they are the underlying geometric structure in Einstein's general theory of relativity, and play fundamental roles in mechanics, quantum field theory, and probably many other areas.  Studying manifolds from a mathematical perspective can be done in two ways: You can study the geometric properties each manifold, one at a time, or you can study geometric properties of the collection of all manifolds at once.  The \"collection of all manifolds\" can itself be thought of as a kind of space, and each individual manifold is a point in this space.

The researcher, Alessandro Jaker, will be engaged in two main activities:  1) Developing beginners' level communicative teaching materials in Weledeh Dogrib, suitable for classroom use;  2) Developing an intermediate level Dogrib language reader, consisting of stories told by local elders.  These stories will come with a glossary and footnotes, to help students still learning the language.  These stories will also provide students with an opportunity to learn about traditional legends and local history.    Alessandro Jaker has been working with the Yellowknives Dene for several  years; these materials will be produced in collaboration with the Goyatik Language Center in Dettah, and eventually used for language classes in the community."

They focus attention on a period that ended about a billion years into cosmic history, when the neutral intergalactic gas was ionized by the ultraviolet light of galaxies.  To calculate how gas and dark matter came together to make the galaxies, the group will use hydrodynamic simulations.  They will develop and refine their calculations to predict when a galaxy should form stars, or develop an active nucleus.  Then, the photons emerging from the galaxy will be tracked using Dr. Li's 3-dimensional radiative-transfer code.  That code will be improved to handle Lyman-alpha photons, ionization, and the effect of very small dust grains.  The group will produce large mock catalogs of high-redshift galaxies and quasars that describe their emission from X-ray to millimeter wavelengths, and include the hydrogen lines at 21cm and Lyman alpha.     Two graduate students will be trained by participating in the research.  The new radiative-transfer code, and the mock catalogs, will be made available to the astronomical community.  Those catalogs summarize the predictions of our theories about how galaxies grow.  This group and others will test those theories by comparing the catalogs with what is seen in current and planned deep surveys of distant galaxies.  Both Dr. Li and Dr. Abel work at institutions with strong records in public outreach, and this project will yield attractive still images and movies to illustrate current ideas about galaxy formation."

Future projects using new telescopes, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the SuperNova Acceleration Probe, will enable detailed, statistical studies of dark matter, and will provide a sensitive and robust measurement of the empirical behavior of dark energy.  Past results from Dr. Blandford's group include: (i) demonstrating that dark matter is effectively collisionless and distinct from normal, baryonic matter (ii) a competitively accurate determination of the Hubble constant using a quadruply-imaged variable galaxy nucleus, (iii) measurement of the clustering of the faintest galaxies observed by the Hubble Space Telescope, (iv) understanding the distribution and clustering of distant quasars, and (v) developing new computational tools for cosmological investigations.    The new work will include: (i) more detailed planning for handling the variability data for many thousands of lensed quasars, (ii) analyzing what can be learned from the rare lensed supernovae and gamma ray bursts, (iii) more about galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and what can be learned about the potential wells of galaxies and their halos, (iv) new ideas on systematic errors in gravitational lensing, notably the difficulty of distinguishing a change in the size of the universe from the addition of extra mass, (v) studying the predicted incidence of exceptional lenses that can be used to test the theory of how mass clumps in the expanding universe, (vi) the distribution of sizes of the largest gravitational lenses, and (vii) how to use the gravitational lensing-induced distortion of the clustering of faint galaxies to determine the distribution in space, properties, and histories of these galaxies.  It will significantly advance understanding of the size, shape and expansion of the Universe and of the properties of its major constituents, dark matter and dark energy.

The idea is to apply an electromagnetic wave on the surface of the object and analyze its interaction with the interior material via surface measurements. One of the objectives of this project is to show that when the surface measurements are taken on only a part of the surface one can still recover the interior composition of the material.    The PI proposes to study non-invasive methods of detection from the point of view of inverse boundary value problems for partial differential equations (PDEs), where one solves a boundary value problem and measures the normal derivative of the solution at the boundary. The question is whether one can recover the coefficients of the PDE from these measurements. The PI proposes to address this problem for the conductivity equation and the Pauli-Dirac system. The PI proposes to use variational convergence methods and Carleman estimates for systems of PDEs."

In exchange for this protection, the trees provide the ants with nesting space and nectar for food. This mutually beneficial interaction between Acacia trees and ants may involve more than just protection, though: preliminary data suggest that at least some of the ants may also fertilize the trees in which they live. The objective of this research is to examine how nutrients are exchanged between ants and trees, to determine how this interaction might affect soil nutrient availability, and to investigate the effect of the disappearance of large mammals on these processes. To address these questions, this study will combine a nitrogen-tracing experiment with soil sampling to track ant-derived nutrients, in addition to using long-term mammal-exclusion plots to investigate the influence of mammals.    This study incorporates work directly applicable to land management in eastern Africa: loss of native browsers, a significant problem across much of Africa, could alter the mutually beneficial interaction between ants and plants, in turn affecting soil fertility and forage quantity and quality. This research will employ a Kenyan research assistant as well as involve undergraduates from Stanford University. Results of applied aspects of the research will be communicated to local land owners and managers through local publications, talks, and conversations."

These invasions are currently considered to be one of the major drivers of global biodiversity loss, among other ills.  This research examines the mechanisms and effects of one unusual invasion: the introduction of the coconut palm throughout the Pacific.  Specifically, this work looks at the negative association between the relative abundances of this palm and of seabirds.  Seabirds will not use the coconut palm as habitat; therefore palm-invaded islands become depleted in the nutrients these birds usually bring from the ocean to the land. Because the tree species native to these islands are adapted to the higher nutrient conditions usually created by the birds, they can no longer compete and regenerate in these new, more nutrient deprived conditions. The seabird decline thus ultimately results in an invasion spiral of coconut palms.  This research also examines other potential feedbacks in this invasion, such as increases to predation on native species seeds or seedlings in invaded forests.  This work has important applications to conservation science and management.  On a global scale, by increasing knowledge of the breadth of invasion mechanisms, this work will provide insight into the best way to manage invasive species and prevent their future spread. Regionally, it will provide tangible recommendations about how this widely used crop should be managed in the Pacific.  Finally, by demonstrating the role seabirds play in maintaining native species, it will expand our knowledge about the importance of seabirds and their conservation."

Surprisingly, hunted tropical forests have up to 66% lower plant biodiversity than un-hunted forests.  Why?  This study seeks to answer that question, using an experiment which mimics the effect of hunting by keeping animals out of forest patches with fences.   Changes in plant composition and diversity inside and outside the fences have been monitored for 14 years.  In this study, characteristics of plants which mediate plant-animal interactions are being measured for each plant species.  Plants with contrasting characteristics are compared to see if they respond differently to the absence of animals.  The responsive plant characteristics act as 'fingerprints', allowing researchers to identify the mechanisms of species loss.    Why care about tropical biodiversity loss?  Tropical biodiversity provides humanity with important ecosystem services and natural resources, often for free.  For humans, wild tropical plants represent a vast resource of disease resistance genes for domesticated relatives, new food plants, potent anti-microbial compounds, effective anti-cancer drugs, and more.  Plant diversity improves the quality of ecosystem services such as pollination and carbon storage.  Biodiversity is not a renewable resource.  Once species are extinct, they cannot be recovered.  Knowledge gained from this study about an under-appreciated threat to biodiversity, hunting, will enable park managers, biologists, and policy makers to better protect this irreplaceable resource."

In science, engineering, business, and medicine, high-bandwidth sensors, large-scale simulations, and data collection bots generate immense data sets that need to be analyzed. Making sense of all this disparate data in becoming increasingly challenging and difficult. Unlike traditional databases where data is carefully massaged to adhere to rigid schemata, much of the above data comes unstructured, is often dynamic rather than static, can contain large amounts of noise or even errors, and can be incomplete. This project aims to develop general, rigorous and efficient techniques for analyzing massive and distributed sets of unstructured data. The basic aim is to exploit certain ideas from computational topology and geometry in the study of the global structure of large, distributed data sets -- and especially to develop data representations and transformations that makes this structure more apparent. Topology studies the connectivity of spaces, so it is global by its very nature. It is able to determine certain connectivity invariants in a way that is unaffected by deformations of an object and does not require explicit parameterizations of the object geometry. Its strength lies, in a sense, in its relative insensitivity to geometric properties, which permits it to discern underlying combinatorial information about how the geometric object is constructed, and therefore detect some qualitative properties.   This type of global analysis can be quite important in understanding the overall structure of data sets. Geometry, though more local by nature, can also be used to study global structure by discovering how parts of an object relate to another, or how parts of different objects can be similar. For example, the Erlanger program of Felix Klein has fueled for over a century mathematicians' interest in invariance under certain group actions as a key principle for understanding geometric spaces.   Such invariances or symmetries can also be key to understanding and reasoning about data sets.    The methods proposed here can be applied in many different settings where massive unstructured data sets arise. In science or engineering, large-scale distributed simulations can produce immense data sets; as an example, consider the Folding@Home project at Stanford that generates protein folding trajectories using hundreds of thousands of CPUs throughout the world. In business, companies such as Google and Yahoo! have to mine billions of web clicks to develop algorithms for matching ads to web page content or to individual users. In medicine 3D imaging is becoming commonplace. Medical imaging diagnostic systems, distributed throughout medical offices nationwide, should be able to efficiently share information about shapes of organs and thereby collectively learn about whether certain variations are associated with different diagnostic outcomes or treatment successes. In all these cases, understanding the global structure of the data can provide valuable scientific, engineering, or medical insights, enabling better business decisions, or leading to more effective medical treatment planning."

The Sierra Nevada (as a mountain range) ends near Susanville, northern California, but its granites continue into the Great Basin to the east. Here they have not been studied in detail.  The first part of this project will detail the exact match between these rocks and the northern Sierra Nevada and will address where specific parts of the batholith cross the northern Great Basin. This project will also address a very controversial set of questions about the landscape of California and Nevada from the Cretaceous (80 million years ago) to present. It has been proposed that the Sierra Nevada as we know it today existed since the Cretaceous and that the region to the east of the Sierra constituted a vast high plateau like the Altiplano of the Andes. The plateau collapsed with the onset of Basin and Range faulting that led to formation of the Great Basin. Data from northwestern Nevada, however, suggests that the crust beneath this part of the batholith was never thick enough to produce such a plateau and that rivers appear to have carried debris eroded from the ancient Sierra into the ocean to the north (a region now covered by extensive young volcanic lava flows). These different ideas will be tested using two methods: 1) Ar/Ar, fission track, and (U-Th)/He thermochronology for arrays of samples from the granites of the batholith, collected with depth beneath the tilted volcanic-granite unconformity in Basin and Range fault blocks, will detail the post-intrusive cooling and the erosional history of the batholith; and 2) age populations of zircons in Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary marine and non-marine sedimentary rocks in California and Oregon will allow determination of where this large volume of batholithic material was eroded and transported to.    This project fills a major gap in our knowledge of Cretaceous to Cenozoic geodynamic evolution large area of North American Cordillera. The Sierra Nevada is a widely studied example of continental arc magmatism yet the northern portion of the batholith, and its recently recognized continuation into northwestern Nevada, has received little attention. The tectonic and magmatic evolution of this area is a key unresolved problem in western North American geologic evolution.

Expected ice motion includes both translation and rotation. To achieve this goal, maps will be generated of submerged ice surfaces, and real-time algorithms which compute the AUV's ice-relative position using sonar soundings of those surfaces will be developed and demonstrated.  This capability will augment all existing AUV under-ice navigation techniques. The system will generate maps that allow a science team to select and visit under-ice sites (either with an AUV or an ROV) by providing a much broader perspective of the submerged ice surface than has ever been possible before.  It will also be possible to return to specific sites for experimentation and serial observations, and includes the ability to hold station in support of imaging and sampling missions.  It will also increase the safety of AUV operations in these hazardous environments. Field tests will be performed during an already funded cruise to study icebergs in the Antarctic."

Information technology (IT) has the potential to mitigate and help solve many of these complicated issues and enhance public understanding.    Intellectual Merit    Government regulations are now available online. However, most of current online portals are primarily designed for displaying the information and are difficult to be used for further processing. The information service infrastructure proposed for REGNET includes repositories as a base and, more importantly, tools to locate, merge, compare, and analyze the information. This service infrastructure will exploit in an intelligent way the communication and computational resources that are now widely available to the public. Seven tasks are planned: (1) textual parsing and storage, (2) semi-structured, indexed storage, (3) means to resolve semantic ambiguities, (4) cross-referencing appropriate for automated retrieval of relevant documents, (5) comparative analysis of related regulatory documents, (6) on-line compliance assistance and checking of governmental regulations, and (7) needs assessment and impact analysis. New and innovative search and analysis techniques will be developed to help disseminate regulatory data and allow finding and comparing multiple sources of related legal and regulatory information.

Successful completion of O-CHEM is a prerequisite for many graduate and professional STEM programs, yet the failure rate is notoriously high. O-CHEM has unique knowledge representation protocols that often challenge even students who initially master general chemistry. There are very few large-scale studies examining why some students succeed while others have difficulty in O-CHEM. Such issues are of particular importance when considering the impact on under-represented minority students and women. A large body of evidence indicates that these groups perform significantly worse in O-CHEM, contributing to the under-representation of these groups in STEM careers.  Previous studies by the PI focusing on how students succeed in STEM courses used techniques such as concept-mapping to examine \"knowledge organization.\" Recent studies show that both experts and high-achieving students demonstrate enhanced knowledge bases. No study has examined how knowledge organization mediates academic performance in O-CHEM. Furthermore, no study has examined the activities employed by students to organize their knowledge appropriately, although more generally, investigations into both expert performance and academic success have demonstrated that concentrated, goal-directed activities are correlated with superior performance. Previous studies by the PI have successfully identified the importance of such activities using techniques such as think aloud protocol analysis, structured interviews, and diaries.   The goal of this study is to combine the insights provided by multiple measurement techniques such as concept-mapping, think-aloud protocol analysis, and diaries in order to examine factors contributing to both academic success and difficulties in O-CHEM, particularly among under-represented minority students and women. This is a \"frontier research empirical study.\" It is being undertaken collaboratively between departments of education, psychology (cognitive science), and chemistry. It is examining equal numbers of minority and non-minority students, and equal numbers of males and females within each group. Groups are also comprised of equal numbers of high-, average-, and low-achieving students.   This study has four specific objectives; to 1) Examine O-CHEM knowledge structures to identify major conceptual difficulties; 2) Compare student-instructor O-CHEM knowledge structure correspondence and identify specific discrepancies; 3) Compare O-CHEM problem solving success and knowledge structures, and; 4) Compare specific study activities and knowledge structures. It may lead to the design of randomized trial studies involving individualized and group tutoring in O-CHEM and, ultimately, the restructuring of O-CHEM syllabi and teaching methods in order to close potential gaps between student knowledge and instructor ideals."

By the time most children begin learning the integers, they have an internal spatial representation that supports their abilities to reason about natural number magnitude, even when presented symbolically as digits.  Recent evidence, however, indicates that children?s reasoning with zero and negative numbers relies on the application of syntactic rules. This contrasts with most adults who have developed a spatial representation of negative numbers in their own right.

Zeiderman, working under the direction of Dr. James G. Ferguson, will undertake cultural anthropological research on the role of risk within emergent forms of urban governance. Alongside security, risk has recently surfaced as a political rationality and technical framework with which to understand, order, and manage the complexity and uncertainty of cities and urban life in the twenty-first century. To explore this phenomenon, this study poses the following overarching research question: Why, how, and to what effect are cities governing the problem of risk?      The research will be carried out during 18 months of fieldwork in Bogot, Colombia. In the mid-1990s, the municipal government of Bogot began mapping the uneven distribution of environmental hazards across its urban space. In 2003, a governmental agency  initiated a resettlement program aimed at relocating thousands of low-income populations living in areas defined as zones of high risk.  To understand how these new forms of risk management work in practice, the researcher will investigate: 1) how the Bogot program shapes the conduct and outlook of the people at risk; 2) how program officials conceive of their own work; 3) how the resettlement process affects the relation between government and citizens; and, 4) how and why risk emerged historically as a political problem.      Research methods will combine institutional ethnography, case studies, and historical genealogy. The researcher will conduct his research in a relocation field office, in an at-risk neighborhood, and among the relocatees who have been dispersed throughout the city. He will do participant observation and conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews with a stratified sample at each study site. He also will collect and analyze official documents guiding the resettlement program.     This research is important because the process to be studied in Colombia is becoming increasingly common world wide, as urban governments adopt the new imperative of  protecting vulnerable populations from potential threats such as global warming, disease epidemics, and national security emergencies. This this research will contribute to a scientific understanding of changing ways in which cities and societies are being governed in times of heightened uncertainty. The project also contributes to the education of a graduate student."

The forces of the global economy have over the past generation given opportunities to ambitious and sometimes destitute people of poor countries to improve their life chances in the West. Yet these waves of immigration have been challenging to the native populations, many of whom see the immigrants as cultural and economic threats. Perhaps the most challenging situation for the incorporation of immigrants, especially in Europe, is that of Muslim migrants.     In light of this social and political concern, this research project seeks to measure whether there is a Muslim disadvantage in economic mobility and socio-political integration for immigrant families into Europe; and if there is such a disadvantage, to determine its cause. That the social and political relations between Europe and the Muslim world are politically fractious underlines the importance of this project. It will focus on France, the European country with the largest population of people of Muslim origin (estimated to be about five million).  More specifically, the project raises two research questions: Do Muslim immigrants and their descendants face greater hurdles integrating into European societies than they would have faced were they alike on all other factors but were non-Muslim?  If they do face greater hurdles, what causes the differences and what sustains them?    To answer these questions, the project addresses one fundamental methodological problem that has held back past researchers from answering these questions convincingly, and then employs three distinct research tools to provide answers to these questions. The methodological problem is that it is hard to isolate a \"Muslim\" effect when (in France) nearly all Muslims are North Africans. To overcome this, the project focuses on two immigrant groups from Senegal, each of which is split between Catholics and Muslims. The only difference between these immigrant groups is religion, allowing the project to infer that systematic differences between these sub-groups in economic or social advancement in France can only be explained by their religious differences. The project will employ ethnographic immersion,  targeted public opinion surveys, and a range of field experiments to measure any \"Muslim\" effect and to determine whether the effect is due to in-group processes (such as treatment of women) or out-group discrimination.    Attacks in Madrid (March 2004) and London (July 2005), and the riots in suburban Paris in November 2005 and November 2007, have all been attributed to \"Muslims,\" and political parties in Europe have mobilized opinion against a Muslim threat to Europe.  Relations between the countries of the European Union and the Muslim world have therefore become politically consequential-foreign policy in regard to the Middle East; new membership into the EU; and the vast migration of Muslim populations into EU states.  This research project allows for an assessment of a discernible difficulty for Muslim migrants integrating into European society with a perspective that can improve public policy in regard to these immigrants, easing their incorporation."

The data will be analyzed for anisotropy and S ? wave velocity, utilizing the high spatial resolution.  Although some preliminary observations of crustal anisotropy have been made in the USA, it has not normally been possible to localize their depth extent, because passive observations are typically made at far lower frequencies (coarser resolution) than active-source measurements.  Hence the need to make 3 component (3C) active-source measurements to complement the now standard 3C passive-source receiver-function methods.  If the PIs are successful,  their results, in conjunction with the existing CD funded explosive-source refraction velocity model and receiver function images, will help estimate the relative roles of magmatic intrusions and crustal flow in maintaining crustal thickness in SE Oregon.    In addition to collecting data of scientific interest to the CD-funded High Lava Plains Experiment, the PIs will demonstrate the technical feasibility of using three one-component (1C) recorders in parallel at a single site to record 3C data.

Debris flows are differentiated from landslides by the pervasive, fluid-like deformation of the mobilized material.  Landslides and debris flows threaten lives and property worldwide.  Despite the fact that good progress has been made within the last two decades relative to understanding hydrologically-driven slope failure, important research has yet to be conducted in 3D physics-based fluid flow and hydrologically-driven slope instability in variably saturated soils.     This award funds interdisciplinary research focused on a physics-based characterization of coupled hydrologic response/slope stability processes for steep hillslopes at the catchment scale.  The model will couple solid deformation with fluid flow processes in variably saturated soils, as well as quantify the exchange of water between the subsurface and surface continua.  This allows us to better understand the effects of surface runoff, evapotranspiration, and percolation on the spatial and temporal variations of degree of saturation, effective stress, and deformation pattern within the variably saturated slope.  The coupled model will be tested with comprehensive and exhaustive data from the Coos Bay experimental catchment (CB1), as well as with the numerical results of recently conducted simulations on the same catchment using an Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM).  This research will also utilize a recently developed stabilized low-order finite element approximation scheme employing equal orders of interpolation for the solid displacement and pore pressure fields.  The highly instrumented CB1 slope failed as a large debris flow in November 1996, thus providing large volumes of data with which to compare the model predictions.    The research team will combine expertise in geotechnical engineering, computational geomechanics, and quantitative hydrogeomorphology available at Stanford University to develop and test a physics-based model of slope failure initiation.  To the knowledge of the PIs, no slope failure initiation model currently exists in the literature that addresses the effect of variable saturation in a quantitative way.  We believe that the FE method has reached such an advanced stage that it can now handle not only complex geometry but also the effect of variable saturation.   A further intellectual merit of this research lies in the tremendous opportunity for testing and validation of the proposed mathematical approaches with the available data set. The CB1 data set allows model testing and validation on a large-scale slope with complex topography and variable saturation.  The availability of high-quality hydrological and geotechnical data for CB1 will help constrain the parameters of the problem, thus providing tremendous opportunity to gain a better understanding of the important processes controlling slope instability.    The study is a timely contribution towards an improved understanding of the processes that control slope instability in a system driven by a rigorous characterization of the near-surface hydrology and soil constitutive properties.  The simulation effort will effectively demonstrate the utility and/or limits of physics-based slope stability models less comprehensive than the one to be developed here for field conditions similar to CB1.  The proposed research will also utilize the advances in computational fluid dynamics for application to geotechnical and geosciences problems.  Both PIs are seriously committed to ensuring full involvement of undergraduate and underrepresented students in this project.  This can be gleaned from their proven track record of mentoring, advising, supervising, and graduating undergraduate and underrepresented students at Stanford."

Human beings consume the energy equivalent of 200 million barrels of oil per day.  Each day, the sun deposits on the earth an energy equivalent of 1.7 trillion barrels.  Since the sun provides nearly 10,000 times more energy than humans consume, this necessitates a need to find a cost-effective way to harness it.  Despite decades of research in solar utilization, we are still far from a cost-effective solution that can provide the ~10 TW of clean power that we will soon need.     This BRIGE award will investigate engineering layered semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, at the nanoscale level to tune their properties for the direct conversion of solar photons to H2 and O2 by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting. The PI aims to transform solar energy research by using nanostructure to control critical PEC properties-namely, the semiconductor bandgap, band edge alignment with H2 and O2 redox potentials, charge transport within the semiconductor, durability, and surface kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).  Previously, the PI has been able to synthesize nanoparticulate MoS2 and that, unlike the case of bulk MoS2, these particles exhibit excellent electrocatalytic properties for the HER due to their nanostructure.  The research activities are fundamental in nature and aim to understand the physico-chemical phenomena occurring on and within these nanostructured dichalcogenide semiconductors in order to exploit this knowledge for the development of new, nanoscale semiconductors.  The PI's ultimate goal is to develop efficient solar-to-fuels devices.    The PI will broadly impact three general areas: societal, scientific, and educational. The grand energy challenge is to improve utilization of solar energy, which will have global and societal impacts.  From a scientific perspective, the knowledge gained regarding the chemical, catalytic, optical, and electronic phenomena within these nanoscale dichalcogenide semiconductors will contribute broadly to a number of different scientific fields.  Regarding education, the PI will conduct a number of outreach activities involving K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Additionally, the PI, native of Puerto Rico, has established outreach opportunities to Puerto Rican students in two locations: (1) the University of Puerto Rico (UPR), where the PI intends to recruit undergraduates to apply to the Ph.D. program at Stanford University, and (2) at the high school alma mater of the PI, Saint John's School, where he will interact with K-12 students and inspire them to pursue science and engineering disciplines.  Closer to Stanford University, the PI also plans to be a role model for local juvenile wards of the court, most of whom are underrepresented minorities. The PI will also participate in Stanford University School of Engineering programs to attract incoming first year undergraduates into science and engineering, with directed attention to women and underrepresented minorities.    This BRIGE grant will broaden the participation of and increase opportunities for all engineers including those from groups underrepresented in the engineering disciplines.  This BRIGE grant will also encourage the PI to become actively and competitively engaged in research as an independent investigator."

For example, on coral reefs, turbulent mixing, as modified by stratification, can determine the strength of coupling between the water column and the reef. In a like fashion, internal waves can also be important to such environments as kelp forests where they may be a critical means of cross-shore transport of larval organisms. Thus, understanding the behavior of internal waves and the mixing they produce in shallow water is a fundamental problem in coastal oceanography.  More generally, the high spatial and temporal resolution of physical measurements will result in a unique data set capable of linking large and small-scale physical processes on the continental slope and shelf. This data will be useful in developing more accurate parameterizations of boundary layer turbulence and mixing. In particular, it will be able to determine simple empirical relations like those found in lab experiments and computations but valid at field scales, that can be used in a wide range of circulation models.    This project will measure Reynolds stresses, turbulent buoyancy fluxes, and turbulence dissipation rates in the near shore bottom boundary layer in the presence of shoaling internal tides and surface waves. Taking advantage of the capabilities of the Kilo Nalu Observatory operated by the University of Hawaii, these measurements will be made in 20 meters of water on the south shore of Oahu. Like many inner shelf regions, the proposed field site provides an environment in which both internal tides and surface waves are common. All the turbulence instruments will be cabled to shore, allowing acquisition of the data at high rates not limited by power or memory. Leveraging ongoing observations of surface waves and internal tides, the turbulence measurements will be supplemented by mean flow measurements made with ADCPs, thermistor and salinity sensor chains, and wave/tide gauges. The field measurements will yield a high quality turbulence data set, made in a setting for which we will have a fairly complete overall description of the mean flow.     The field program will involve graduate and undergraduate students from University of Hawaii and Stanford University. These will be involved in all phases of the work, in particular, the scientific diving operations needed to install and recover the instrument suite. This group will include several women Ph.

Recently, structural fracture has been observed in the I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis and to over 100 buildings that experienced shaking in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake in the Los Angeles area. Motivated by these events, this project will develop improved methods to predict fracture in steel structures such as bridges, buildings, industrial facilities, or ships. The research focus will be on understanding a special type of ductile fracture that originates on the surfaces or corners of structures. The investigation will involve a program of laboratory testing and complementary finite element computer analysis to evaluate critical values of stresses and strains that cause surface fracture in structural steel. The project will culminate in the development of computational models that will enable engineers and scientists to accurately calculate and mitigate the risk of fracture in steel structures.    The models developed through this research will enable the design and construction of buildings, bridges and other structures that are safer and more fracture resistant. To disseminate and promote use of the research findings, the principal investigators will educate engineers through workshops, training courses and technical publications.

It has long been assumed that the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification, ammonia oxidation, is restricted to a few groups within the domain Bacteria. However, the recent discovery of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) has seriously challenged our understanding of the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of nitrification in the ocean.     In this project, researchers at Stanford University and the University of Hawaii at Manoa will attempt to constrain quantitatively the contribution of marine Crenarchaeota to oceanic nitrification and investigate connections to other forms of nitrogen metabolism in the Gulf of California (GOC) and the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP).  The specific objectives are to: (1) quantify 15N-ammonium oxidation rates, and bacterial and archaeal amoA genes and transcripts, at seven stations in the upper water column (0-100m) of the GOC and ETNP; (2) determine if Crenarchaeota are actively fixing inorganic carbon (i.e., autotrophic) based on uptake of 13C--labeled bicarbonate into archaeal membrane lipids; (3) quantify nitrite oxidation rates and nitrite-oxidizer abundances at the same depths and stations; (4) extend these measurements to multiple depths within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ); (5) examine potential coupling between ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nitrogen loss processes in the OMZ of the GOC and ETNP, and (6) place our results in a broader oceanographic perspective by tying into NSF-funded work examining nitrogen fixation in N-deficient waters ultimately generated in OMZs.  The researchers predict that marine Crenarchaeota will play a dominant role in ammonia oxidation-based on amoA abundance, gene expression, active fixation of isotopically-labeled inorganic carbon, and correlation to measured rates?in both the upper water column and OMZ.  They also expect that metabolic coupling between AOA and both oxidative (nitrite oxidation) and reductive N metabolisms (e.g., anammox) will be apparent.    With regard to broader impacts, nitrification plays a pivotal role in linking organic matter mineralization to anaerobic nitrogen removal, and this project will provide critical information regarding how nitrification and the underlying microbial communities are influenced by key environmental gradients, as well as their connections to other N-cycling processes. Ultimately, this multi-disciplinary study should provide insights into the ecology and regulation of this biogeochemically-important process in all marine systems. The proposed research has excellent educational opportunities, and the PIs have a history of successfully mentoring and graduating Masters and/or Ph.D. students and fostering student publications and presentations at national meetings. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education will be furthered through active participation in the cruise and post-cruise analyses, where students will work collaboratively with experts in molecular microbial ecology and stable isotope biogeochemistry, and learn a spectrum of state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods."

These mechanisms are often designed to aid people with disabilities to perform common everyday tasks such as reaching or moving from one chair to another. Humans in general, and people with disabilities in particular, possess enormous variability in their capabilities and preferences, requiring such mechanisms to be flexibly adapted to functional variations. Solution of such problems often leads to mechanism configurations that do not conform to either the serial chain or fully parallel architectures that have historically been the focus of most studies in robotics. The research will combine fundamentals of kinematic theory, control theory and sensor design to achieve a comprehensive design methodology. The theory will be developed and the methodology will be validated through the design of examples of mechanisms intended to assist disabled individuals.     	If successful, the results of this research will provide researchers with a design framework for mechanism design that incorporates human interaction as an integral part of the overall design objective. Because this research will accommodate alternate mechanism configurations, it has the potential to significantly improve our ability to design new human-assist devices. The systematic methodology will provide designers with the tools needed to incorporate the theory of mechanism design into the design process. A unique user interface for mechanism design, prototype design solutions, and documentation of the methodology will result from this research.

Intellectual merits    this is a very well written proposal but the idea for using nanowires as force probes is not novel to the PI. However, the application of such nanowires as force probes to measure cell adhesion forces is novel, potentially leading to knowledge that is currently unavailable. The PI conducted an outstanding literature review and has good technical knowledge of the state-of-the-art in nanowire synthesis and their applications for force sensors in biological systems. The PI also makes a very good effort to seek out collaborators who have expertise in cell biology to assist in the experiments.    In terms of broader impacts, the proposed research if successful will have significant scientific impact in the field of nanosensors for cell interactions, adhesion and the dynamics of cell behavior.    The review panel recommends that this proposal be funded.    Cell adhesion is critical for many fundamental processes in living organisms and its malfunction can cause serious diseases. The cell adhesion force is typically small and varies at the nanometer length scale but the current cell adhesion force measurement largely relies on microscale sensors. Nanoscale force sensors using nanowires will be developed to enable new capabilities in the cell adhesion measurement. The proposed research has four objectives: 1) developing methods to fabricate and assemble nanowire force sensors; 2) quantification of the piezoresistive effect of nanowires through electromechanical measurements; 3) investigating methods to functionalize nanowires with the extracellular matrix proteins; and 4) integration of force sensor arrays with the fibroblast for cell adhesion force measurement. This project will advance the fundamental knowledge on the mechanical and electronic properties of nanowires and provide critical experimental data to understand on how cell adhesions affect the behaviors and functions of cells. This project will be participated from the underrepresented groups at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels in engineering. Research results will be broadly disseminated through journal publications, classroom teaching, conference presentations, and collaborations with other research groups."

Moreover, to be practical, such a procedure must scale to large quantities (on the kilogram level which precludes atom-byatom approaches) and be environmentally friendly (green chemistry). We propose to accomplish this task using a new technique in which a microemulsion of two immiscible liquids (such as oil and water) is sprayed as tiny droplets into a third phase (supercritical carbon dioxide) that dissolves one phase and not the other, causing the insoluble phase to be precipitated. Actually, the situation may be yet more complex in which the biologically active compound of interest is what is insoluble whereas the other two phases dissolve in the supercritical CO2. By the addition of suitable biocompatible polymers, we can encapsulate our nanoparticles for time-delayed release or for targeting to specific cells for uptake. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide as an antisolvent for the precipitation of desired biologically active compounds from microemulsions is a subject requiring deep fundamental study before its possible advantages can be realized. We have already obtained preliminary data that encourages us to believe that this approach can be developed into a new drug delivery methodology.  The research proposal is for work to be done in collaboration with Professor Krister Holmberg at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. His group has expertise in formation of inorganic nanoparticles in microemulsions allowing 5-10 nm particles to be formed at controlled reaction conditions. We bring to this collaboration the expertise in the formation and control of nanoparticles in supercritical fluids. An important new aspect will be the added encapsulation process as well as physical evaluation of the particles. The work will range from fundamental studies of how nanoparticles are formed to how they behave in biological systems by studying their use in drug-controlled release experiments and distribution in living animals. The efforts of these two groups complement one another in a way that increases the likelihood for success of this project.    Broader Impact: The goal of the project is to develop a new process which allows for nanoparticle formation and encapsulation of a wide selection of target compounds. The process will yield particles in the 1-5 nm range with a narrow size distribution as well as allow for insitu encapsulation with high yield. The process will require low temperatures (35-45 C) as well as minimal processing steps, making it compatible with bioactive compounds and rapid enough for labeling studies. Other advantages of the proposed process are reduction in toxic waste and direct scale up of the process parameters to realize the potential of achieving high-volume manufacturing. Clearly, the success of such a procedure will have profound impacts on other fields that span pharmaceuticals, microelectronics, foodstuffs, paints, and cosmetics. In addition, this research project will provide training of one graduate student in a truly interdisciplinary area at the cross section of chemistry, biology, and engineering"

External fields or non-uniform charge distributions can alter assembly behavior in surprising ways by accelerating, inhibiting or changing the assembly process. In particular, many molecular and biological species are themselves highly-charged systems which may also undergo significant conformational and electrostatic reconfiguration during reaction/assembly. This general problem of self-assembly in external fields and charge-redistribution during the assembly process has received little attention, yet is vital for the goals of top-down/bottom-up patterning or more traditional applications such as DNA microarrays and biosensors. This project will systematically measure how electric fields modulate self-assembly at interfaces, and develop a fully-vetted theoretical model. A new optical technique will be applied to monitor the spatial and temporal build-up of assembling species as well as the ionic double layer with single nanometer accuracy, providing new, quantitative information on the dynamics of highly charged species. In these experiments DNA serves as an ideal model system, as preliminary studies have shown that ionic strength and electric fields have some effect on assembly, but a complete theoretical model has not been established. DNA transport to the interface, hybridization, and melting kinetics will be studied as a function of length, potential field, mismatch locations, and charge density.     The intellectual merit of this project is to elucidate how electric fields and ion distributions affect self-assembly mechanisms. Fundamentally, this work will fill a void in our understanding of how highly-charged species interact and react at surfaces under an external bias. While small ion and colloidal behavior in external fields are well-established areas, self-assembly under electric fields, the tendency of monomer reconfiguration during assembly, and the effect of force distribution on DNA within field gradients have not been explored. Mean-field and Brownian dynamics theoretical models will be developed that can replicate the results of these experiments, providing deeper insight into their mechanism.     The broader impacts of this project include developing models to predict the hybridization and melting dynamics of DNA on surfaces, providing straight-forward error correction methods for nanomaterials assembly, educate graduate and undergraduate students, and to disseminate these findings. Development of new methods to control interfacial activity is important for separations, bio-fouling, DNA-array technology and coatings. A full understanding of the interplay between assembly and fields will allow design of pulse algorithms and conditions through which to greatly accelerate DNA hybridization while reducing mis-matches and cross-contamination, a critical problem for commonly used DNA microarrays, and can be implemented in a number of applications. These results will be widely shared with other researchers, foremost through development of a website with free public access to the codes and protocols used. In addition to scientific and technological impact, this proposal incorporates an educational outreach component as well. Undergraduate research, curriculum development, scientific professional development, and tutoring elementary school students are an integral part of the research program."

They will also allow  simulation of complex quantum systems, providing an important tool  for nanotechnology. The principal challenge in actually building  quantum computers is finding a way to tolerate imperfections. In  fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), the faulty operations that  cause computational errors must be used to detect and correct those  errors. A radical approach to FTQC is to base the computational  scheme on topology.  Computation is performed by braiding  topological structures; fault-tolerance arises naturally due to the  invariance of large-scale topology to small, local distortions  caused by random errors. Until recently, implementation of this  rather abstract idea has demanded exotic, unobserved physical  particles or unrealistically high-dimensional structures. However,  it was recently shown that topological FTQC may be achieved in a  two-dimensional lattice of quantum bits in a scheme relying on a  novel form of quantum entanglement called a cluster state.    This research investigates the conversion of topological  cluster-state-based FTQC into a realistic, scalable, solid-state  hardware architecture. The particular hardware studied relies  critically on computation via communication, enabling reasonably  sized quantum processors to be connected to form quantum  communication networks or large quantum multicomputers. The  investigators experimentally develop semiconductor-based quantum  memories in optical microcavities, optimized for quantum logic  mediated by light in integrated optical waveguides.  The research  includes the development of experimental methods to fabricate and  characterize large arrays of these qubits, while detecting and  compensating for fabrication defects.  These experimental efforts  are supported by theoretical development of scalable, topologically  fault-tolerant architectures designed around the observed hardware  limitations."

First, rather than being centralized or peer-to-peer, the architecture is based on federation: cooperative but not necessarily collaborative interaction between multiple parties.  This enables providers to enforce local administrative and security policies, yet requiring new support for discovery, messaging, and migration between and within domains.  Second, application communication is grounded in three-dimensional coordinate spaces: objects can only communicate after being introduced through proximity.  This geometric addressing decouples applications from their physical locations on hosts, and introduces interesting security protections from unwanted communication.  Third, by using this communication model, the architecture can directly interface with and connect the physical world, leading to new possibilities for virtual interactions.    Much as the Internet was designed with a layered communication model, this research designs a new layered approach for virtual worlds: from a high-level object layer providing a rich programming environment for immersive virtual worlds, to the narrow waist of geometry-based communication, and down to the underlying service layer that implements computation, storage, and communication mechanisms.  With backgrounds across networking, systems, and graphics, the investigators have been previously developing a highly expansible and personalizable virtual world system, Meru.  This new project will develop the network architecture necessary to enable the seamless interaction and interoperation between many different Meru-based virtual worlds.    Integrating virtual worlds is already a pressing issue and concern among providers. Research towards a unifying networked system architecture would improve these efforts and could lay the groundwork for a next-generation programming platform for the Internet. It would integrate the current divide between the logical, host-centric networks and the emerging sensor networks of tomorrow. By incorporating existing efforts towards building an open, scalable virtual world system, the research will have impact in all of the areas virtual worlds are already bringing change.  Fundamentally, virtual worlds, even more so than the  Internet, are a platform for inter-personal communication, affecting education, public services and planning, commerce, and social networks."

Accordingly, they must find ways to comply    with expectations, which may be complex and varied, as well as with    relevant privacy laws and regulations, while they minimize    operational risk and carry out core functions of the organization    efficiently and effectively. Designing organizational processes to    manage personal information is one of the greatest challenges facing    organizations (see, e.g. a recent survey by Deloitte and the Ponemon    Institute [TI07]), with far-reaching implications for every    individual whose personal information is available to modern    organizations, i.e. all of us.    This project responds to these challenges by developing methods,    algorithms and prototype tools for integrating privacy, compliance,    and risk evaluation into complex organizational processes. It    explores, articulates and characterizes formally the scope and nature    of privacy-expectations of stakeholders as well as those of key    regulations, such as HIPAA, GLBA, COPPA, BASEL 2, and Sarbanes-Oxley    (SOX). It incorporates the diverse perspectives and areas of    expertise of its multidisciplinary research team, which includes    three computer scientists, one philosopher, and collaborating    researchers from IBM.

Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field.   This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists. In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics.   Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields.   In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science, we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines.   With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters.     This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge).   It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge. Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field.   The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents.   The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services."

Virtual worlds open new avenues for education, business, and scientific discovery, and can significantly enhance collaboration in virtual organizations.  To accomplish this requires scalable and secure system architectures, complemented by appropriate tools for creating virtual world content.  This project aims to design, build, deploy, and evaluate a virtual world platform for use as a research and development platform for virtual world technology and applications.  The two major research thrusts are system architecture and content creation.  For system architecture, the project will develop: (1) continuous dynamic world partitioning for maximal resource utilization and fault tolerance, (2) a capability-based security engine that seamlessly enforces access controls, (3) a scalable content distribution network for bandwidth-intensive virtual world content, and (4) privacy-preserving archiving of virtual world events for scientific research and exploration.  For content creation, the project will investigate domain-specific modeling tools that leverage domain knowledge and community input to drastically ease the three-dimensional modeling process.    The project significantly advances the state of the art in virtual world systems and three-dimensional content creation.  The scalable and secure virtual world platform will be able to support millions of participants concurrently interacting in a shared three-dimensional simulated environment.  The novel content creation methodologies will enable untrained participants to create unique high-quality three-dimensional objects for a variety of application domains.  Dedicated data collection capabilities will support social science, legal, and economic research on previously unseen scales, with analysis of large-scale behavioral data that may yield deep and novel insights into human and societal behavior."

It creates sophisticated new computational models for extracting and representing ideas and measuring their impact and novelty, and for extracting and representing social relations and identifying forms of multidisciplinary collaboration. Its methods integrate the network analytic tools of social science with the language processing tools of computer science. It uses network analysis to improve the ability of computational tools to identify ideas in scientific texts, as well as the tools of computational linguistics to help explain the co-evolution of scientific collaborations and innovations. The models of ideas and their diffusion can be used to investigate hypotheses such as whether multidisciplinary research accelerates or decelerates scientific innovation, and how multidisciplinarity influences student and faculty careers. A relatively shallow but large-scale study of the MEDLINE corpus is combined with a richer organization-level study of Stanford University faculty (their publications, grants, affiliations, advising, and teaching) in order to explore and analyze the complex interrelationships of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration.    The research agenda of this project is to produce new and unique data, create new computational tools, and extend theory so that scholars change their conceptions of scientific innovation, multidisciplinarity, and research communities more generally. The integration of social network and natural language processing techniques is helping to develop a new vein of research in computational social science, simultaneously offering empirical rigor and scale to the sociology of science and extending natural language processing from its previous engineering focus toward true explanatory social science models."

Many engineers and more classical systems neuroscientists believe that these assumptions are obviously false, but a decisive set of experiments would be crucial in encouraging new types of computational models of the brain, including models which fit with what actually works in image processing in technology. On the other hand, if the experiments begin to show how such learning capabilities are actually possible within the traditional paradigm, that would be equally transformative.

What role did political parties play in incorporating the working classes into the electorates of European democracies? And, why are so many Americans, particularly the working and lower middle people, still alienated from participation in their countrys electoral processes? This research begins with the premise that these questions reflect different perspectives on the same political phenomenon: The context of electoral competition especially the rules governing legislative elections and their interactions with the geographic distribution income shapes the incentives of political actors to mobilize and incorporate low-income and working-class citizens. The proposed research contributes to a recommended Collaborative Research Proposal from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.     Earlier accounts of the relationship redistributive policy emphasize a stark division between multimember district (MMD) electoral rules and single-member district (SMD) rules (e.g., Iversen & Soskice 2006, Persson & Tabellini 2000). These accounts, however, miss the important modifying effect of electoral context - specifically, the geographic distribution of citizens of different types - on the effect of electoral rules in structuring legislators' policy-making incentives. The intellectual merits of this proposal lie, therefore, in the recognition that given the national context in which elections are held - in particular, the geographic distribution of income - the electoral institutions of contemporary democracies may undermine the opportunities for those societies to achieve their democratic ideals.    As part of a European Science Foundation Collaborative Research Scheme (EUROCORES), the proposed research will contribute to a broadly collaborative and highly integrated project that is motivated by questions about voter turnout.

Logical Spreadsheets expand the utility of    traditional spreadsheets by  dispensing with the distinction between directly specified cells and    computed cells and generalizing  from functional definitions to logical constraints.    One problem with logical spreadsheets is the potential for    inconsistency. In using logical spreadsheets,  users can select values for cells that are inconsistent with the    values of other cells, given the constraint  defining the spreadsheet.  Simply eliminating inconsistent values is    not the answer - (1) rejecting new  values that are inconsistent with past values limits the user's    freedom and (2) dropping past values that  are inconsistent with new values restores consistency but loses    information.  On the other hand, retaining  inconsistencies is problematic when the spreadsheet tries to derive    consequences of updates, since  inconsistent logical theories entail everything!    Unlike logical entailment, existential entailment behaves well in the    face of inconsistencies and, therefore,  is more useful in this setting.  Work in this project includes (1) a    study of the behavioral properties of existential entailment in the    context of logical spreadsheets, (2) the development of  efficient    algorithms  for computing existential entailment (with special attention to rule    transformation, reformulation, and  differential logic), (3) the development of an open-source Javascript    implementation incorporating these  algorithms, and (4) an evaluation of this technology in the form of     user surveys, comparative studies, and  ablation studies.

Media multitasking is a growing phenomenon observed among 8-18 year olds, yet little is known regarding how this behavior influences key cognitive, developmental and behavioral processes which affect the way young people learn, reason, socialize, think creatively, and understand the world. Previous research in the adult population generally shows that media multitasking negatively impacts productivity. However, little research to date has examined the processes underlying children's media multitasking or how such processes may affect cognitive development and learning.     Clifford Nass of the Stanford CHIMe Lab and Roy Pea, Co-PI of the NSF LIFE (Learning in Informal and Formal Environments) Center, in partnership with the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop, will convene a symposium for an interdisciplinary group of leading scholars from neuroscience, child development, cognitive, communication, and education fields, and key policy leaders to advance our understanding of the potential implications of media multitasking for learning and cognitive development in children and youth. The primary goal of the symposium is to define a coherent agenda to stimulate needed theory-based research on the implications of media multitasking for learning and cognitive development.  The symposium will consist of three panels of multi-disciplinary experts to examine: a) media multitasking and cognitive development, b) media multitasking, learning and productivity, and c) design principles for leveraging media multitasking in educational contexts. A meeting report will be distributed on the symposium website and in print form. The symposium website will also facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among a newly defined research community and serve as a clearinghouse for information on the implications of media multitasking for cognitive development and learning. Overall, the activities associated with this grant will help activate a new special interest academic community, and encourage and facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration across institutional, intellectual and methodological disciplines. Through understanding how media multitasking may affect psychological processes underlying learning and cognition, practitioners will be better prepared to inform policy and to maximize educational impact in a broad range of learning contexts."

A key problem is how to coordinate activity when the task definitions, task owners, and communication paths can be known only as the work unfolds. Can constraints be imposed on the behavior of workgroup members that are flexible enough to allow this kind of creativity, but structured enough to make best use of the group's cognitive resources? Many organizations find dynamic workflow to be a challenging problem and actively seek better methods.    This pilot project addresses the question of dynamic workflow using formal Workgroup Protocols as an organizing principle. The first step is to define an execution model for structuring the stream of tasks, without limiting the content of the tasks. The next step is to define explicit protocols for such common activities as planning, delegation, reporting, and so on. Finally, experiments will be conducted with human subjects, to test impacts on performance and general usability of the protocol framework.    The intellectual merit of this work rests in the novel approach to structuring collaborative work. Rather than relying on free-form communication to allocate cognitive resources, this research explores how design ideas from computer systems may be adapted to fit emergent cognitive activity, and what kinds of modifications would be needed.    The broader impacts of this work would be seen in three areas: (i) providing a new vision for managing knowledge work, with more dynamic control over accountability and transparency; (ii) setting a research agenda for developing tools, models, languages, and systems; and (iii) suggesting massively-collaborative structures, similar to Wikipedia, but with more intricate task dependencies and communication flows."

A large research literature has addressed one dimension of this challenge -- the rise of radical right parties (e.g., Stubager 2008; Green-Pederson and Odmalm 2008; Bjrklund and Andersen; Togeby 1998).  An emerging literature is documenting another dimension - the conflict of cultural norms (e.g., Sniderman and Hagendoorn 2007). This project explores potentially the deepest strain of all - between the norms of liberal democracy on the one side and the requirements of religious inclusion on the other.     The Danish \"Cartoon Crisis\" is one of the most dramatic examples of the strain between the values of liberal democracy and the honor of the Muslim faith. Denmark is accordingly the focus of this study. But its findings have broad relevance to liberal democracies in Western Europe. This exploratory study focuses on two questions. First, does an intense clash over colliding values increase popular intolerance toward Muslim immigrants? Second, is popular opinion responsive to elite interventions in support of democratic values?     The answers to these to questions will help illuminate the scope of choices open to political leaders during moments of crisis. If the answer to the first question is no, and the answer to the second yes, political elites have room to chose policies that are experimental and inclusive. If the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second is no, political elites have less room to maneuver and will be under, at least in the short run pressure to adopt \"tough on Muslim\" policies -- for example, making the standards to acquire citizenship more demanding.     For its empirical base, this study relies on three separate - but temporally overlapping - surveys of the general public conducted under the direction of Professor Lise Togeby. This set of partly overlapping surveys provides a unique record of public reactions spanning two distinct intervals -- when the Cartoon Crisis was in the forefront of public attention and when it had receded into the background.

While choice is generally seen as universally impactful, recent cross-cultural comparisons reveal that the powerful motivational effects of choice may be limited to middle class European American groups of people.  In other words, choice and its effects on behavior are intimately tied to an individualistic cultural perspective.  This research project explores the role of choice in self processes, especially with respect to a sense of agency, and the nature and consequences of choice in three cultural contexts -- middle class European American, middle class Indian and working class European American. Fourteen studies will examine several key ideas.  First, in middle class European American contexts, choice impacts self expression and feelings of agency, which benefits performance on cognitive and physical tasks but negatively affects interpersonal relations.  Second, in middle class Indian contexts, self restraint rather than self expression via choice is associated with agency and benefits individual performance.  And third, in working class European American contexts, social solidarity rather than self expression (again, via choice) is related to agency and benefits performance. Thus, choice is not equally powerful for everyone and has some negative consequences even for those who are most likely to reap its rewards.     The theoretical significance of this project rests, in part, on refining and enriching previous understandings of sociocultural effects and not, as is often the case, on introducing a novel dimension of cultural variation. Moreover, of both theoretical and practical significance is that the research seeks to show that while choice can be effective in motivating behavior, its impact depends on the specific sociocultural contexts with which people engage. That is, effectively motivating people to stop smoking, to vote, or to save energy resources depends on invoking socioculturally matched models of agency. Overall, then, this research promises to more fully explicate the choice by embedding it in sociocultural contexts and thereby contribute to policy makers' efforts in designing interventions that benefit communities."

These features have defied easy explanation because scientists have lacked clear images of their deep underpinnings. Earthscope's FlexArray is allowing a new generation of imaging procedures.  Traditionally, seismologists studying the lithosphere have been restricted by limitations on available equipment to deploying single lines of receivers, allowing imaging of two-dimensional cross-sections through the crust. Earthscope's FlexArray finally provides enough instrumentation that a two-dimensional array at the surface can be deployed, allowing reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) image volume at depth.      The Basin-and-Range Province in Nevada offers unparalleled exposure of diverse styles of extension, including the metamorphic core complexes that juxtapose ductilely deformed mid-crustal rocks with unmetamorphosed, brittly-deformed supracrustal rocks. This relationship implies significant horizontal extension, compensated at the scale of the whole crust either by large-magnitude simple shear or significant lateral and vertical flow of the lower crust. Elucidating the relationship between simultaneous deformation of the upper and lower crust requires geophysical data of sufficient resolution to convincingly show how the surface geology is linked to - or disconnected from - features at depth. Uncertainty in the total stretching involved is a major unknown in tectonic reconstruction of extensional provinces wherever such core complexes occur around the world.     The National Science Foundation?s Earthscope Science program is teaming with the Petroleum Research Fund of the American Chemical Society to sponsor a 3D study of the classic Ruby Mountain Metamorphic Core Complex and its adjacent basins (Lamoille-Huntington Valley & Ruby Valley) to look for evidence of crustal flow into the metamorphic core.  This region is being targeted because the existing data that surround the Ruby Mountains allow detailed interpretation of the new geophysical results in a larger 3D volume. The detailed FlexArray geophysical studies of the crust and upper mantle, using a 40-station array of passive, broadband seismometers, will provide an important link between Transportable Array data and surface geologic data to develop understanding of continental structure, deformation and evolution, and the lithospheric-scale processes involved in extensional orogens. Established passive-recording techniques (ambient-noise tomography, receiver-function velocity inversions, common-conversion point imaging, crustal anisotropy analyses) are being applied in 3D instead of the more commonplace two dimensions, and at a higher resolution (5-km spacing) than is yet typical for this class of studies.    Results of this experiment will allow evaluation of models for crustal flow at depth beneath extending regions, and thereby help understand the progression of lower-crustal strain in space and time across extending regions. Characterizing these processes in more detail is a fundamental step towards advancing our knowledge of continental rifting and the evolution of sedimentary basins world-wide.  The results should also be of interest to gold-mining companies active in Nevada: the Ruby Range may expose underpinnings of the adjacent Carlin Trend, the largest gold-producing region in the Americas, as well as helping understand the geologic framework that gave rise to Nevada's most destructive earthquake for over 50 years (the February 2008 Wells magnitude 6 earthquake)."

Asymmetric cell division, in which one cell divides to create daughter cells that differ in size, location and cellular components, is an important mechanism for solving these developmental challenges. While all organisms must solve the same problem of generating asymmetries, they do not always come up with the same answer.  This project uses the development of stomata (epidermal structures that regulate CO2 and H2O exchange between the plant and atmosphere) as a model to understand how asymmetries are generated in plants. BASL protein, first identified by its role in stomatal development, is a plant-specific regulator of cell and tissue asymmetries, and will be used to identify the general components required for plant asymmetric cell divisions.  Stomata not only provide a framework to discover fundamental developmental mechanisms, they function as major components of terrestrial water and carbon cycles. As we witness changes in the global climate, understanding the mechanisms by which plants control the density and pattern of stomata will be essential to produce food or fuel crops that withstand or mitigate production of detrimental climatic conditions.     This CAREER proposal integrates research, teaching and public outreach about genetics and developmental biology. A new course was designed to make students consumers of biological information from a variety of sources, including primary literature and the mainstream media.

Data yields are low; networks last weeks, rather than months; long downtimes are common.    Professor Levis proposes a long-term agenda of research and education to improve the robustness, manageability, and scalability of low-power wireless sensing systems. The dominant design principle behind this agenda is network visibility. Described colloquially, visibility measures a user?s ability to identify the cause of a network event, such as a packet drop. We propose to research how to make networks more visible.    The research agenda is grounded in the exploration, development, and evaluation of the Mote Network  (MNet) architecture, an open-source protocol suite and toolkit for sensor network application development and deployment. The protocol suite will include existing dominant protocols redesigned for improved visibility as well as novel protocols whose designs maximizes visibility.

Designers prototype because \"enlightened trial and error outperforms the planning of flawless intellects\" (David Kelley).  While a few leading-edge endeavors have shown the value of prototyping and learning from alternatives, these design successes have been resource-intensive or in niche contexts.  Attempts to reach a broader audience have stumbled because they were heavyweight, bespoke, or against the grain of important design practices and values.  Consequently, most interfaces today are launched with minimal understanding of alternative design choices and their relative efficacy.  In this project the PI will explore, evaluate, and disseminate the techniques necessary to make enlightened trial and error a cornerstone of user interface design.  To these ends, the project's technical and empirical research comprises three thrusts which will unearth fundamental principles and evaluate them through software tools that leverage web services    Creating Designs Analogically.  Programming with traditional API documentation as the sole resource has the same difficulty as creating a meal with only a grocery list.  The elements are all there, but none of the context necessary for composing a coherent and complete whole. The PI hypothesizes that tools specifically designed for creation by example modification would look quite different than current tools and yield significantly higher-quality results.  The PI will carry out a systematic exploration of the design space for design-by-example tools to identify major design decisions and tradeoffs, and provide a performance and complexity comparison of important design points.    Exploring Alternatives Parametrically.  Prototyping's concreteness benefit can also be its Achilles heel when it encourages premature commitment.  To address this, the PI envisions parametric interfaces, a representation with lightweight semantic structure for fast and broad design space exploration.  Design stakeholders and lead users lacking the time or expertise to design interfaces would be able to parameterize and rapidly iterate them, thereby shifting the designers' responsibility from creating a specific artifact to creating a context for participation.  The PI's initial research suggests that parametric tools increase both broad exploration and fine-grained tuning.  An additional benefit is that parametric interfaces would facilitate appropriate adaptation to user abilities and device characteristics.    Designing Pervasive Interactions.  How can tools enable the rapid exploration and evaluation of new interactions that combine ubiquitous computing and web services?  Such interactions would allow designers to leverage information repositories and data transformation (through web services), while engaging the user in the world instead of in front of the desktop (through ubicomp). While software has almost always been built with the assistance of toolkits and libraries, few software tools have deeply embraced this reality and leveraged it.  The PI plans to create tools for designers to work opportunistically by foraging for and combining pre-existing, high-level blocks of functionality.    In each of the technical thrusts, the PI will conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluation comparing the quality of designs produced with and without the technique, as measured by independent raters, and he will also conduct longer-term case studies for a more ecologically valid understanding of their use.      Broader Impacts:  Design has emerged as a critical engine of innovation in today's multi-billion-dollar information technology industry.  The software tools resulting from this project will contribute a conceptual understanding of how to most effectively create, manage, and learn from prototypes by leveraging web services, which are widespread yet still evolving. To enable ubiquitous access to enlightened prototyping, all of the software and course materials the PI has created and will create at Stanford are open source and available online.  The PI will also serve as an advisor to the Stanford?s K-12 Learning Lab, which is bringing design thinking into public schools."

The proposal will apply empirical and simulation analysis to try to understand the causes of these differences, focusing in particular on three key factors:The first looks at the potential role of increased uncertainty in driving recessions by reducing hiring, investment and productivity-enhancing reallocation. The idea is that the rise in uncertainty during recessions will make firms cautious about hiring and investment, cutting the aggregate labor force and capital stock. However this will also reduce the reallocation of factors of production across firms, since productive firms will be more cautious about expanding and unproductive firms more cautious about contracting. Since the reallocation of factors appears to drive the majority of aggregate productivity growth, uncertainty could play a large role in driving business cycles.     The second will look at explaining variations in management practices across firms and countries. Business people, policymakers and the media have long claimed that management practices play a key role in shaping firm productivity. But empirical economists have had relatively little to say because of the absence of good management data. The proposal will use a new double-blind survey tool to help to build a systematic evidence base on management practices, and use this to investigate which factors and policies help explain variations in management across firms and countries. The third will look at the role of increasing trade competition from developing countries in driving productivity growth through innovation and IT investment. The rise of Chinese exports in particular has been generating intense debate over its impact on employment and growth. Many commentators have also linked this to the rapid increase in wage-inequality. But these effects are difficult to evaluate because of the lack of internationally comparable micro-data. This proposal will build a new US and European database on employment, innovation and IT to help evaluate the impact of import competition from China and other developing countries.    Broader Impacts: Three of the many potentially important broader impacts of the proposed research are the following. First, the work has the potential to identify concrete interventions at the firm level that could significantly increase productivity, particularly in developing countries. Second, the proposed research will create important new databases that are likely to be valuable to both scholars and policymakers. Third, the proposal makes a compelling case that the proposed research will have unusually large spillovers to teaching and mentorship."

Recent results suggest even deeper connections with potentially significant implications for the related problems of compression code design, modeling random processes for the analysis and design of signal processing and coding systems, and understanding the nature and structure of mathematical models of random processes capturing the important properties of signals arising in the real world. This research is concerned with developing precise results characterizing and applying these connections to obtain new insight, theory, and algorithms.    In 1977 the performance of an optimized source coding system was shown to be bounded by the quality of a constrained simulation of the source, with equality under certain conditions.  In 2008 this connection was strengthened by a precise formulation and proof of an information theoretic ``folk theorem'' stating that source coding systems performing near the Shannon optimum yield bit streams that are ``nearly coin flips'' in the rigorous sense of closeness in Ornstein's d-bar process distance. Together these results imply that source coding systems --- including digital speech, audio, image, and video communication and storage systems --- and simulation systems --- comprising stationary codings or filterings of iid bits --- are mathematically approximately equivalent systems, and hence the theory and design algorithms appropriate for one yield corresponding results for the other. This project exploits these connections to develop new theory and design algorithms for codes for compression, simulation, and modeling based on known distributions and on distributions learned from data."

INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  No current therapies exist to induce complete spinal cord regeneration; however, the clinical community suggests that a combined approach involving biodegradable materials, cell transplantation, and drug delivery offers the best hope. Towards this broader goal, the focus of this project is to develop new design strategies for adaptable biomaterials that undergo predictable, cell-induced remodeling.  All of these materials are fabricated using recombinant protein engineering technology, which allows precise molecular-level control over the entire primary structure.  Due to this exquisite level of control, the initial mechanical properties, degradation profile, and cell adhesivity of the biomaterial can be independently and exactly tuned.  Through precise design of these adaptable biomaterials, dynamic two-way communication is enabled between the biomaterial and embedded cells.  This two-way cell-scaffold communication will be studied using neural progenitor cells encapsulated within these adaptable biomaterials.  In Aim 1, the relationship between initial biomaterial properties (elasticity and cell-receptor-ligand density) and cell phenotypic response (three-dimensional neurite outgrowth and protease enzyme secretion) will be determined.  The PI hypothesizes that neurite outgrowth can be directed through material design.  In Aim 2, the PI will develop a theoretical model to predict degradation profiles and compare this model to experimental measurements of cell-induced remodeling. It is hypothesized that cell-scaffold interactions can be dynamically controlled through precise local tuning of the degradation rate.  In Aim 3, the PI will explore the use of cell-induced remodeling as a trigger to release peptide pharmaceuticals from biomaterials. It is hypothesized that tailoring of the biomaterial degradation rate and the peptide diffusion rate will provide predictable delivery profiles.    BROADER IMPACTS:  This program includes an integrated education plan that promotes teaching and learning across multiple groups. At the high school level, students from under-represented groups will participate in hands-on research, share their experiences with peers and teachers in the classroom, and receive continued mentoring as they embark on their collegiate careers. Success of this new program will be assessed with help from the Stanford Office for Science Outreach, and results will be disseminated at national conferences and in engineering education journals. The integrated education plan also includes activities to promote diversity and interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate students through new course development as well as formal and informal mentoring programs. The research impacts the broader scientific community by providing new approaches to design highly tailored biomaterials with adaptive properties. Currently, no general strategy exists to control the rate of biomaterial adaptation after implantation. These types of adaptive biomaterials are required to develop therapies for spinal cord regeneration and may guide the way towards future prosthetic interfaces that integrate with host tissue, such as implanted prosthetics that grow with a child."

Yet multiple genes, not one, often determine cell phenotypes. One example is the sustained proliferation characteristic of immortalized mammalian cells. A mutation that changes the expression of a single gene or activity of a single protein rarely suffices to immortalize a cell; instead, multiple genes generally need to be mutated. This project investigates how multiple genes contribute to the phenotypes of immortalized cells: proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and serum-independent growth. This project also aims to determine how different gene expression levels affect these phenotypes. In other words, the experiments address both combinatorial and dose effects.     Broader Impact:      This technology provides a powerful tool to generate cell lines with properties optimized for the production of therapeutic proteins. Using this experimental and analytical platform, this project will generate cell lines that exhibit high proliferation rates in low serum or serum-free media. Expression of various gene combinations will be evaluated for the ability to improve or create cell lines. Gene candidates include known oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and cell cycle regulators, as well as genes identified previously by retroviral mutagenesis in mice.

This project examines new concepts towards this goal in four disparate areas.  The first involves the rational design of ligands for formation of dinuclear and heterodinuclear metal complexes as catalysts for addition reactions.  The second area involves asymmetric trimethylenemethane (TMM) cycloadditions.  The fact that the addition of the acceptor occurs on the face of the TMM unit distal to where the metal and its attendant ligands reside makes asymmetric induction highly challenging.  With the aid of molecular modeling, new ligand families have been designed for [3+2], [3+4], and [3+6] cycloadditions.  The third section examines Pd and Mo catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation.  Using ligand design, contrasteric nucleophilic addition to the more substituted allyl terminus as well as contrathermodynamic addition to the C-2 position of the allyl unit will be attempted.  Novel Ru-Pd sequential reactions for asymmetric synthesis will also be studied.  The fourth area is the asymmetric induction in Ru catalyzed reactions for their exploration in alkene-alkyne coupling and allylic alkylations.    With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research program of Professor Barry M. Trost of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University.  Professor Trost's program revolves around the theme of enhancing synthetic efficiency by inventing new catalytic processes that exercise enhanced chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-selectivity.

In this CAREER proposal the PI, proposes to study the target-site search strategy of DNA-binding proteins. The PI will develop a reaction-diffusion methodology to model the facilitated diffusion of a protein finding its target site. The reaction-diffusion theory will capture both the protein dynamics and the conformational behavior of the DNA, building a prediction for protein translocation that can be adapted to different physical models of DNA. The theory will be extended to 2-site binding proteins by combining facilitated diffusion to lock in the first binding site and a subsequent looping mechanism to bind the second site. The PI proposes a two-state mechanism for complex formation in 2-site binding proteins that includes thermal induced looping and a cinching mechanism due to non-specific binding of DNA to the second protein binding site. Analytical theory and Brownian dynamics simulations of supercoiled DNA will be used to develop a theoretical framework to predict the nucleation and growth of supercoils in plasmid DNA, which will be used to address the impact of plectoneme formation and restructuring in the binding kinetics of 1-site and 2-site binding proteins. In conjunction with the theoretical efforts, an integrated experimental program to test the theoretical predictions and guide model development will be developed. Using restriction enzyme digestions as a probe for target-site localization, experiments will be performed to verify the theoretical predictions and the proposed mechanisms for the target-site search. This research proposal represents a multi-faceted approach to understanding how proteins exploit non-specific binding to enhance kinetics, which is central in the biology of small numbers. Outreach efforts include the development and implementation of teaching modules into the education of high school students that are being treated for childhood cancer.

Statistical approaches for identifying dominant reaction pathways from incomplete data collected from response experiments have been introduced. These methods permit the analysis of incomplete experimental data in biochemical reactions.

Eutrophication is of particular concern in estuaries, with over half of the estuaries in the United States experiencing its effects. Harmful levels of N in estuaries can be diminished through tightly coupled processes in the microbial nitrogen cycle, including nitrification (chemoautotrophic oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate) and denitrification (the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to N2 gas). In fact, coupled nitrification-denitrification can remove up to 50% of external dissolved inorganic nitrogen inputs to estuaries, thereby reducing the risk of eutrophication. Despite the biogeochemical importance of both nitrification and denitrification in estuarine systems, surprisingly little is known regarding the underlying microbial communities responsible for these processes, or how they are influenced by key physical/chemical factors.     The investigators will work in San Francisco Bay - the largest estuary on the west coast of the United States - using molecular, biogeochemical and cultivation approaches to explore how the distribution, diversity, abundance, and activities of key N-cycling communities are influenced by environmental gradients over temporal and spatial scales. Denitrifying communities will be studied using functional genes (nirK and nirS) encoding the key denitrification enzyme nitrite reductase, while genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) will be used to study both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and the recently-discovered ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)- members of one of the most ubiquitous and abundant prokaryotic groups on the planet, the mesophilic Crenarchaeota. Analyzing sediments from sites spanning a range of physical and chemical conditions in the Bay, seasonally over the course of several years, will represent an unprecedented opportunity to examine spatial, physical/chemical, and temporal effects on both denitrifier and ammonia-oxidizer communities in this large, urban estuary. Concurrently, an intensive cultivation effort will also be undertaken, in order to compile a novel culture collection of estuarine denitrifiers and ammonia-oxidizers, for which virtually nothing is currently known. Taken together, these complimentary approaches will help reveal how complex physical/chemical gradients influence the diversity and functioning of key estuarine N-cycling communities over time and space.    The broader impacts include obtaining a critical understanding of how underlying N-cycling microbial communities are influenced by complex and fluctuating environmental gradients over time and space in the San Francisco Bay estuary which should translate to insights into the ecology and regulation of these biogeochemically-important processes in all estuarine systems. In addition, results of the research will be communicated and investigated through several key educational and outreach activities: (1) a sophomore-level course to be developed and taught focused on San Francisco Bay as a model system for understanding the biogeochemical and societal importance of large estuaries; (2) Bay Area high school biology teachers will be targeted for a 4-week intensive microbiology summer course; (3) development of a 'microbial community' module to the REAL (Redwood Environmental Academy of Learning) Program, focused on the hands-on ecological teaching of 'continuation' students at nearby Redwood High School; and (4) mentoring and training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, who will be directly involved in the research project over the next 5 years."

These workshops will address issues related to supporting the emerging discipline of design through graduate education and interdisciplinary design research. Participants from a broad range of disciplines, including engineering, architecture, industrial design, visual arts, psychology, and business, among others, will be invited to attend.     Design is an integrative activity that spans many disciplines; however, our educational system often struggles to provide interdisciplinary design experiences for our undergraduate and graduate students and to recognize the significance of design research. Recently, new and innovative interdisciplinary graduate programs in design have arisen with strong ties to engineering yet structured to fully embrace and complement research from other disciplines. These graduate programs have the potential to influence the development of a new discipline of design that includes both education and research. Interdisciplinary education is a central factor in expanding and sustaining an American competitive advantage in today's global economy. Developing design as a broadly recognized and practiced instructional discipline is essential for maintaining leadership in the innovation of new products and systems. This series of workshops will bring together experts in the field of engineering design research and education and the larger design community to explore the challenges, successes, practices and future directions of interdisciplinary design graduate programs to gain insight into how to construct, grow, and sustain programs that prepare students for successful design innovation. If successful, this series of workshops will form the basis of new approaches to design education and research that fully embraces interdisciplinary collaborations within the current structure of academia."

There have been extensive research efforts aimed at capturing mercury and understanding its speciation in flue gases, but not as much is known of selenium and arsenic in the chemically complex flue gas environment.  The proposed research will also examine novel sorbent technologies for the capture of these trace elements, and a mechanism responsible for their retention will be determined.  Model development will take place through high level ab initio energetics calculations.  The research activities proposed will advance discovery through the development of two kinetic models that will elucidate, for the first time ever, the mechanism of retention of selenium and arsenic on calcium based sorbents.  In addition, the proposed plan includes the development of a high school outreach program, which will involve undergraduate students training high school teachers on the incorporation of computational chemistry and molecular modeling techniques into their science courses.  The research and educational activities combined will advance understanding through the incorporation of molecular computational applications in the classroom, which will provide both college and high school students the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of chemical interactions using multimedia-based approaches for effective teaching.      Understanding the speciation of selenium and arsenic in the flue gas environment is essential for developing effective technologies to control their emissions.  Homogeneous reactions involving these species will be examined through the theoretical prediction of rate constants obtained from quantum mechanical derived potential energy surfaces.  Effective core potentials that include relativistic effects will be incorporated into the basis sets, and this will be carried out for all calculations using both Quadratic Configuration Interaction (QCI) and Coupled Cluster (CC) techniques.  Heterogeneous reaction investigations will also take place to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the retention of arsenic and selenium on calcium-based sorbents.  Heterogeneous rate constant predictions will be experimentally validated through the analysis of the reacted sorbent material using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).  In total, this research will benefit the scientific community in that there will be a greater understanding of the speciation of these trace elements in the flue gases of combustion processes and also further understanding on methods involving their capture.  The impact that the proposed research could have on society is the possible prevention of the release of these toxic elements into the atmosphere."

Researchers face   the challenge of collecting, evaluating and integrating   large amounts of different kinds of information about   organisms, cells, genes and proteins to generate a valid  hypothesis. And once a hypothesis is generated, the challenge   is to evaluate the hypothesis with respect to what   is already known.     Our proposed research will:    1.	Test the scalability and extensibility of a novel   	computer system that allows biologists to construct   	and evaluate alternative hypotheses against a knowledge   	base on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.     2.	Test a knowledge archive that supports the archiving   	and search of validated hypotheses.            In our work, we define a hypothesis as a statement about   relationships between components of a biological system   that are intended to explain experimental observations.   A set of validated hypotheses can be used as building blocks   to construct larger, more complex models such as   pathways. We plan to develop and test a new paradigm:   that of hypothesis-driven querying of model organism knowledgebases.     The proposed work, called HyQue (for Hypothesis-based Querying   of pathway models), will take as input working hypotheses about  pathway models expressed in a knowledge-based formalism,   evaluate their consistency using existing data in a knowledgebase,   and provide as output contradictory evidence and suggestions for  improving hypotheses.  HyQue will incorporate formal knowledge   representations based upon Semantic Web standards and   an ontology to represent biological objects and relationships.  HyQue will also contain a library of rules that determine   counts of support and contradiction for a given hypothesis.     We will prototype an archive of hypotheses that allows users   to compare their hypothesis with other hypotheses submitted by   their peers.  We will explore the capability to:    	(1) express working hypotheses about the yeast cell cycle;   	(2) provide integration of data in the Saccharomyces Genome   	    Database to evaluate/test pathway-specific hypotheses;   	    and  	(3) archive these results.     As analytical tools and database resources proliferate,   biologists require facilities to integrate existing data   into knowledge that can create a shared understanding of  biological models. Our work will explore the expressivity   and scalability of unique and novel querying and contradiction based   reasoning methods that use rich formal knowledge specifications of  biological events in order to accomplish information integration.   Our proposed work will lead to a novel paradigm of querying   biological knowledge that can dynamically retrieve, integrate and  interpret information in terms of biologically relevant   relationships asserted as pathway models. Our work will   examine the value of Semantic Web technologies in building   a knowledgebase for such querying and reasoning and will   aid in standardizing models of biological knowledge and   add momentum to a range of ongoing ontology building efforts.

The goal of this project is to exploit a new concept of capturing/exploiting soft information at nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc network. Storing appropriate information from these overheard transmissions and its subsequent reuse can increase multi-hop throughput performance. This appears to be a new idea with significant potential to improve throughput and scalability of multi-hop networks. The nodes in such networks will need large storage capabilities to exploit this technique. However, with the dramatic reduction of memory costs, this is now economically feasible.     A variety of issues related to developing this new concept will be explored: (a) Scalability of the network throughput with increasing node density, with varying path loss exponent and in the presence of time selective fading. (b) Appropriate format or metrics for soft information captured from overheard packets (c) Memory requirements as a function of node density and other related parameters."

Venture capital is, in turn, critical if young firms are to innovate. What is not well understood is what type of venture funding best promotes innovation. In this Doctoral Dissertation Research Grant, the co PI addresses this question by first constructing a novel longitudinal dataset on 230 U.S. Minimally Invasive Surgical device startups founded between 1986 and 2007 and then comparing the impact of four types of investors (government agencies, venture capitalists, corporate venture capital groups, and angel investors) on innovation among these firms.  The proposed research will make several novel theoretical contributions. First, it explores how young organizations can best select and manage relationships with investors. This approach is in contrast to current research that emphasizes ways in which organizations can mitigate their dependence on external resource providers. A second contribution will be an exploration of how external resources, as opposed to internally generated R&D funds, impact firm innovation. Third, this research considers both the benefits and perils associated with forming relationships to acquire financial resources.   Findings will have direct applicability to entrepreneurs making decisions about when and from whom to take funding in order to promote innovation. This research has implications for public policy regarding the public funding of innovation, and about incentives for private investment in innovation.

Yet because workers' compensation coverage is compulsory and universal in most U.S. states, few scholars have compared its consequences to those of tort liability. Methodologically, the problem is that there is no readily-identifiable \"control group\" against which to compare the behavior of affected workers and firms.  However, one state--Texas--offers a unique laboratory in which to undertake such comparisons.  Under Texas law, employers may opt out of workers' compensation and forfeit tort immunity.  This phenomenon, called \"nonsubscription,\" has been on the rise since the 1990s among large firms.  Interestingly, despite having no legal obligation to do so, most large nonsubscribers furnish their workers with occupational injury plans that substantially replicate the benefits provided through workers' compensation.  This study, the first stage of a planned multi-part investigation into Texas nonsubscription, will examine how nonsubscription affects the frequency, cost, and duration of large firms' occupational injury claims.  The key methodological challenge that any study of this type must confront is selection bias.  Since firms are not randomly assigned across sectors, firm-level disparities between subscribing and nonsubscribing firms may reflect unobservable differences between firms.  To minimize the potentially confounding effects of firm-level self-selection, this study has obtained highly granular data from a diverse group of large nonsubscribers that operate homogenous facilities in many U.S. states.  To exploit variation across states, the study compares workers in the Texas facilities of each nonsubscriber to employees in its non-Texas facilities.  Meanwhile, for those firms that have retained data from the period prior to nonsubscription, the investigator also will compare trends before and after each firm's date of opt-out."

Bird, will undertake research on the social and ecological contexts of foraging, landscape burning, and habitat modification among Martu aborigines in Australia's Western Desert. Indigenous burning is increasingly recognized as an important force in shaping plant communities and biodiversity in the United States and around the world. However, the ability of scientists to directly observe the complex relationships between human culture and subsistence, climate change, and the patterning of fire is hampered by the fact that few indigenous communities have relative autonomy in burning. In this regard, Australia provides a unique research opportunity.    The impact of anthropogenic fire is considered to be particularly significant in Australia, where indigenous burning has been hypothesized to have radically altered the continent's biogeography. Furthermore, many aboriginal communities in the arid interior still have relative autonomy in fire application. Therefore, research that examines Australian practices will (a) inform models of fire management in similar arid regions in the United States; (b) illuminate the effects of fire suppression in contexts where anthropogenic burning has been a critical component of habitat structure; and (c) test the hypothesis that human impacts on the environment did not begin with agriculture, but extend to hunters and gatherers throughout human evolutionary history.     The researchers will develop basic analytical tools and collect new data to characterize how land-use and fire treatment affects variability in key components of arid lands diversity and habitat fragmentation. They will employ a variety of research methods including analysis of climate data and LandSat photos, detailed landscape mappings, focal follows of Martu individuals, transect mappings, and agent-based modeling.     The research is important because it will allow scientists to better understand how the interaction between land-use and fire may be mediated by climate change, how it affects plant and animal densities and distributions, and how, in a politically decentralized society, individuals overcome problems of collective action in supplying future benefits derived from burning.

Questions to be addressed include: 1) How does utilization of the OML by D. gigas vary on both a daily and seasonal basis, and how do the vertical distributions of the OML and its associated fauna vary? 2)What behaviors of squid are impaired by conditions found in the OML, and how are impairments compensated to minimize costs of utilizing this environment? and 3)What are the physiological and biochemical processes by which squid maintain swimming activity at such remarkable levels under low oxygen conditions? The investigators will use an integrated approach involving oceanographic, acoustic, electronic tagging, physiological and biochemical methods. D. gigas provides a trophic connection between small, midwater organisms and top vertebrate predators, and daily vertical migrations between near-surface waters and a deep, low-oxygen environment (OML) characterize normal behavior of adult squid. Electronic tagging has shown that this squid can remain active for extended periods in the cold, hypoxic conditions of the upper OML. Laboratory studies have demonstrated suppression of aerobic metabolism during a cold, hypoxic challenge, but anaerobic metabolism does not appear to account for the level of activity maintained. Utilization of the OML in the wild may permit daytime foraging on midwater organisms. Foraging also occurs near the surface at night, and Dosidicus may thus be able to feed continuously. D. gigas is present in different regions of the Guaymas Basin on a predicable year-round basis, allowing changes in squid distribution to be related to changing oceanographic features on a variety time scales.     This research is of broad interest because Dosidicus gigas has substantially extended its range over the last decade, and foraging on commercially important finfish in invaded areas off California and Chile has been reported. In addition, the OML has expanded during the last several decades, mostly vertically by shoaling, including in the Gulf of Alaska, the Southern California Bight and several productive regions of tropical oceans, and a variety of ecological impacts will almost certainly accompany changes in the OML. Moreover, D. gigas currently supports the world's largest squid fishery, and this study will provide acoustic methods for reliable biomass estimates, with implications for fisheries management in Mexico and elsewhere. A related goal is to work with colleagues in Mexico on a squid fishery management plan. Previous work involved collaboration with Mexican colleagues, including training and research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students from both nations. It also involved public outreach efforts through television, print and web media. This charismatic species provides an excellent means to connect climate change with ecological effects, and outreach activities will continue with this theme. A new international effort will establish a laboratory for research on squid at the site of field work in Santa Rosalia, Baja California Sur, Mexico. The facility will involve Mexican college students in marine research and implement local educational programs."

This expression reflects the recognition that decision-makers who must justify their decisions to others have an easier time defending that decision if they can say that they did what ?most people? would have done?i.e., favored the high-status option. Yet while research in economic sociology has documented such an effect, research on status in social psychology has shown what appears to be the opposite pattern, whereby accountability dampens biases in favor of status characteristics such as gender or race. With this background in mind, the intellectual merits of the proposed project are that it: 1) develops and tests a new theoretical analysis of the role of accountability in status processes that advances our understanding of important social inequality processes; 2) integrates two previously separate and seemingly contradictory strands of research on accountability and status biases. The key to this reconciliation involves recognizing that accountability is constitutive of status because status not only signals ?quality? but also acts as a social coordination device by which people align their behavior in relation to others. Insofar as a decision-maker feels dependent on audience approval but knows only that the audience is aware of the status structure, it is rational for a decision-maker to favor high-status options even when the decision-maker personally does not endorse them. But insofar as the decision-maker: believes or suspects that the audience holds unconventional beliefs (e.g., that gender and race biases are illegitimate), the bias towards high status options will be reduced.     Two experiments will test hypotheses about the conditions under which accountability produces biases in favor of high status options and those in which it suppresses such biases. The first experiment employs a consumer product choice decision following economic sociology. The second involves the assessment of applicant files for hiring similar to social psychological research. Conditions within each experiment manipulate the decision maker?s sense of the audience for his of her decision so that, for both consumer choice and hiring recommendations, we predict high status favoritism in one condition while we expect such favoritism to be suppressed in other conditions.     The project has several broader impacts. First it has the potential to inform policies aimed at reducing workplace discrimination against women and minorities by increasing accountability. This project suggests that the positive effects of accountability will only be realized in an environment that can effectively override conventional beliefs and replace them with specific beliefs in the local environment that decouple the association of status and quality. Second, the project will contribute to the infrastructure of science by providing graduate students and several undergraduates at two universities with first hand training and experience in the conduct of social research. Third, from past experience, the PIs expect that up to half of the graduates and undergraduates will be women and racial/ethnic minorities.

The fungus proliferates outside plant cells and elicits tumors through predicted secreted proteins that interact with maize cells.   To date the plant-fungal interaction has been studied using fungal mutants and little is known about maize contributions that confer the tumor outcome.   In this project changes in maize and Ustilago gene expression will be monitored during the early stages of infection/cancer induction by cataloguing the genes expressed and production of new proteins by each partner.  Data will be collected from infected, immature maize tassels (the organ responsible for producing pollen), because they are readily infected and maize mutants with defective anthers in an otherwise normal tassel block tumor formation specifically in the anther tissues.  RNA and protein responses will be analyzed comparing susceptible wild-type anthers to a male-sterile mutant for additional insight into the maize anther proteins required for tumor growth.  The potential impacts are a novel approach to understanding steps in anther development in maize and by extension other cereal crops and better understanding of how pathogens exploit host properties that are specific to one organ type.  The long-term aim is define the individual steps in tumor elicitation, using as a working model production of fungal molecules that bind to maize receptors to alter development.   As cereal crops are the most important contributor to agricultural productivity in the US and worldwide, this new knowledge is important for crop improvement and protection.  In the course of the project, a postdoctoral fellow will receive training in high throughput mass spectrometric protein identification, an emerging technology applicable to many complex biological problems."

Chalcogenide Phase Change (PC) materials are of interest due to their widespread application in high density PC optical recording and random access memory (PCRAM) devices. The operation of these devices involves a complex interaction of temperature and electrical potential distributions, which are strongly coupled to the PC crystallization kinetics. This research will substantially improve the depth of understanding of nanoscale heat (and charge) transport in PC nanoengineered materials.  The project includes experimental measurements of the crystallization kinetics parameters and transport properties such as thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, melting point, heat capacity, and latent heat.  The experimental structures will be integrated into a novel MicroThermal Stage that is capable of real time monitoring of the full cycle crystallization process using electrical resistance and optical reflectivity measurements and equipped with provisions for conventional, or in situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies.     Intellectual Merit: Answers are sought to questions such as but not limited to: How are the transport properties and crystallization parameters affected over millions of full cycle crystallization processes?  Is it possible to increase the Seebeck coefficient without adversely affecting the electrical conductivity? How are the melting temperature and latent heat affected by the PC nanoparticle size distribution?  Novel micro-instruments will enable study of ultrafast (over 10 million K/s) crystallization kinetics processes.  A nanocalorimeter will allow investigation of melting temperatures and latent heats of PC materials with a resolution in excess of 1 nJ.      Broader Impact: This research increases understanding of the origins of the threshold switching, drift in threshold voltage and reset resistance, and failure mechanisms in PCRAMs devices.  Hence, the research may lead to identification of nanoengineered PC materials with substantially enhanced thermoelectric properties. In addition to involving undergraduate and graduate student researchers, heat transfer visualization tools previously limited to use in advanced laboratories, will be brought to the realm of the undergraduate class. The existing, mainly theoretical heat transfer (HT) course will be converted to a hands-on interactive experience.  HT demonstration educational videos that illustrate the basic concepts of heat transfer will be prepared, with an emphasis on heat transfer visualization. They will be posted on YouTube, and we will solicit feedback from viewers. Subsequently, we will improve the early YouTube postings by compiling the most relevant contents in the form of 4 lectures video series, 15 minutes each, working with the producers of the award winning Silicon Run series."

FIB concentrations display diurnal variability such that the time the sample is collected dramatically impacts the measured concentration, which could make the difference between compliance and noncompliance with water quality standards. Also, it is not known whether the concentrations of actual pathogens, and thus associated health risk, also experience such fluctuations. Thus, it is critical to obtain information on the processes that control these diurnal fluctuations for FIB and human pathogens. Sunlight is believed to be the major cause of the diurnal fluctuation in FIB. The goal of this project is to develop predictive tools for assessing the sunlight-mediated inactivation of fecal indicator organisms and human viruses under a range of environmental conditions prevalent in natural waters. The specific research objectives involve a coordinated effort by a multidisciplinary team to study sunlight-mediated inactivation in the field, the laboratory, and via modeling. Field work will be conducted at one ocean beach in California and a freshwater beach on Lake Superior. These sites, which differ in salinity as well as the concentration of sensitizer molecules, will be compared with data from a third site for which we already have completed the field work. Field experiments will be used to develop empirical relationships between environmental conditions and inactivation rates of FIB and human viruses. Laboratory experiments will be used to develop a mechanistic understanding of the processes that control inactivation, and to understand the nature of observed differences between organisms and field sites. Field and laboratory data will be combined to develop a model that predicts inactivation rates for any water given easily obtainable environmental.     Broad dissemination of the results of this study will be accomplished through publication of peer-reviewed research papers, participation in a conference focused on beach water quality, and direct interaction with policy makers and beach managers. Information gleaned from this study on natural waters will also be extendable to understanding sunlight-mediated inactivation of organisms in other engineered and natural systems, such as solar disinfection of drinking water and waste stabilization ponds. This work will promote teaching, training and learning, as the PIs will involve students in all aspects of the research and will integrate the results obtained into their classroom instruction.

For these volumetric CBCTs to realize their full potential and enjoy broad clinical acceptance, the scatter must be removed and imaging dose must be significantly reduced while maintaining the advantages of conventional CT. This study will enhance understanding of noise and scatter behaviors in CBCT and gain useful knowledge on how to effectively remove the undesirable signals while reserving the edge information.  The approach proposed has the potential to significantly change the way clinical systems are designed today, and could facilitate the design and translation into the clinic of new, large volume CT imaging systems. This research should lead to a significant advance in CBCT to fully realize the technical capacity of volumetric imaging. The methodology and techniques developed by this study may also be applicable for solving similar problems in other related bioengineering fields.  Successful completion of this project will provide radiation oncology and related fields needed high quality volumetric imaging with reduced patient radiation dose. The proposed technique will allow physicians to better see the patient anatomy especially the low contrast tissues and more accurately define the tumor target volume. The improved image quality will also make it possible to use CBCT for accurate dose calculation and dose reconstruction. This will lay the foundation for next generation of adaptive therapy to optimally compensate for the patient setup error and inter-fractional anatomy change."

A cryogenic helium gas bearing is used to rotate a disc containing a drive mass pattern of alternating density under a small test mass mounted on a micromachined cantilever. Any mass-dependent force between the two will produce a time-varying force on the test mass, and consequently a time-varying displacement of the cantilever. This displacement is read out with a laser interferometer, and the position of the drive mass is simultaneously recorded using an optical encoder. Comparison of the measured force to predictions from finite element analysis yields bounds on new gravity-like forces which could signal new physics. The experiment uses several novel techniques to overcome some of the challenges associated with the necessary precision measurements that could prove to be useful in similar experiments or other areas. These include radiation pressure to cool a micromachined cantilever, the combination of encapsulated Micro-Electrical-Mechanical-System (MEMS) sensors with an integrated cryopump, the use of a macroscopic gas bearing as a general-purpose low-temperature motor, the methods of simple and precise fabrication of intermediate-scale metallic structures, and some of the techniques of dimensionally stable planarization.     While the Standard Model successfully unifies the electromagnetic, the strong and the weak interactions, it ignores gravity. This poses a great mystery in fundamental physics: why is even this most feeble subatomic force, i.e. the weak force, so much stronger than gravity? Modern theories that attempt to answer this question predict modifications to Newton's law at much longer length scales, up to 1 millimeter. The technology used in this experiment is at the cutting edge of micro-fabricated devices."

The project will develop a new framework for mathematical modeling of rechargeable batteries, taking into account statistical thermodynamics, concentrated-solution reaction rates, elasticity, crystal anisotropy, stochastic effects, and composite microstructures. Existing engineering models simply fit the open circuit voltage empirically and postulate dynamics by linear diffusion of intercalated lithium, but recent experiments contradict this picture for phase-separating materials. In contrast, the team will develop robust mathematical models to predict the voltage and current response over the full range of operating conditions. The basis for modeling at the single-crystal level will be Cahn-Hilliard partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, expressing chemical-potential dependent reaction reactions. The goal will be to provide the first mathematical description of emerging high-rate materials, where phase transformations occur via nonlinear intercalation waves, coupling anisotropic diffusion and electrochemical reactions. This effort will also raise basic mathematical questions in linear and nonlinear stability, degenerate wave solutions, and numerical methods.    In spite of extensive engineering over the past few decades, the performance of rechargeable batteries has improved only incrementally. Power density (charge/discharge rate per unit mass) and cycle life must still improve drastically for applications such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, and this will require a better fundamental understanding of how ions are inserted and extracted from porous electrodes. To meet this need, the project creates a Focused Research Group from mathematics, chemical engineering, and materials science to develop a new theoretical paradigm for Li-ion batteries. The group will guide the engineering of new ultrafast Li-ion batteries, capable of charging and discharging in seconds rather than hours, while opening fruitful directions for applied mathematics. The group will train graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs, organize annual workshops, and develop a course on mathematical modeling of electrochemical energy systems."

This award extends the Stanford LIGO group's ongoing program on advanced gravitational wave detectors to address risk mitigation for Advanced LIGO and to provide research for enhancements to Advanced LIGO to increase observatory sensitivity. In particular, research will focus on improved optical coatings, control of electrostatic charging, and tilt sensing for the seismic isolation system. (1) The team will include new expertise in NMR spectroscopy of amorphous oxides in the earth's crust and Raman spectroscopy, to obtain micro-structural information on bond configurations in the selected coating materials. Thermal noise due to mechanical noise in these coatings will limit the sensitivity of any future interferometer beyond Advanced LIGO. Thus the goal of this research is to understand the physics of the mechanical loss mechanisms so that we can inform other researchers in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) on the mitigation of this noise source. (2) The team will also work with the LSC to develop requirements for a charge management system for Advanced LIGO.  Scaling arguments will be used to predict which sources of potential electrostatic charge accumulations might be dominant.  Numerical calculations will prioritize them and identify those that merit full finite-element modelling of their contribution to the noise budget.  Development of mitigation techniques will include research on alkali ion in-diffusion to achieve weakly conducting test mass surfaces that will allow spurious surface charges to relax to equipotentials without impacting the optical and mechanical coating losses. A localized UV LED conduction channel to allow passive charge equilibration between the test mass and the grounded frame without damage to the UV-sensitive optical coatings will be evaluated. 3) Research will be initiated to develop improved tilt sensors for increasing the performance of the active seismic isolation systems in Advanced LIGO using externally excited, passive ring optical gyroscopes which could be used to directly measure the ground rotations and improve the performance of the isolation systems which would lead to improved operational reliability of Advanced LIGO.  This research program includes participation from many disciplines including mechanical, electrical and control engineers, physicists and materials researchers. The nature of this multidisciplinary effort makes it ideal for training graduate students. High school students and university undergraduates are encouraged to participate in these projects, integrating research and education. In addition, the program will develop and transfer technologies to the commercial stream."

Feedback tracking microscopy is a powerful new technique for studying the dynamics of individual macromolecules, which has already begun to make significant new contributions to our understanding of biological macromolecules such as DNA. Prior experiments in this area have been limited to the study of relatively large molecules and have required the use of many fluorescent dyes to label the molecule under study.  The technical advances we will pursue under this NSF award will make it possible to apply feedback tracking microscopy to a wide range of molecules of moderate size using only a few fluorescent dyes for labeling.  We will make these advances by applying modern methods of control theory to design improved feedback tracking algorithms, and through the development of advanced signal-processing electronics and motion-control hardware.  Deliverables will include publications on the improved algorithms and apparatus, as well as more detailed technical documentation to be made freely available in electronic format.    If successful, the results of this research will enable new experiments in single-molecule biophysics and biochemistry, making it possible to apply feedback tracking microscopy for example to individual enzymes and ribozymes.  Feedback tracking can be used greatly to enhance the sensitivity of traditional optical measurement techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).  It is reasonable to hope that tracking-FCS and tracking-FRET measurements on single enzymes/ribozymes will deepen our understanding of stochastic kinetics and persistent heterogeneity in these important classes of biomolecules.  The PI will incorporate the results of such work in his introductory-graduate level course on applied control theory, and the graduate student funded by this NSF award will benefit from a highly interdisciplinary training at the interface of modern engineering and biophysics/biochemistry."

One prominent legal and policy remedy for these disparities is school desegregation. It is unclear, however, to what extent inequalities stem from differences in school environments or from differences in family background and other extra-school attributes.  In this research, the investigators exploit a random assignment of students to a desegregation program to answer the question, \"Given the same family background, what is the effect on minority students of attending a more integrated, higher-achieving school?\"  The analysis uses data from a voluntary interdistrict desegregation plan that allows minority students to transfer from a largely minority and low-income district into neighboring, mostly white and upper middle-class districts.  The project will use three sources of data to assess the outcomes of interest: 1) School district administrative records to assess academic outcomes; 2) Student and parent surveys to assess social outcomes; and 3) In-depth parent and student interviews to test the mechanisms that connect school context to student outcomes.  Prior research has primarily focused on the effect of schools on academic outcomes; however, some of the most profound effects of school context are likely social--reflected in students' attitudes, friendships, level of civic engagement, and racial and ethnic identities.  This mixed-method approach will provide an opportunity to explore the processes that drive the observed outcomes, something that has been lost on previous research.    Broader Impacts: This research has implications for the educational opportunities for minority and low-income youth.  Racial achievement gaps have proven to be stubborn, despite the sweeping changes in accountability procedures brought about by the No Child Left Behind legislation.  There is very little good evidence on the ways in which desegregation in schools may alleviate achievement gaps or how it may socially prepare minority and low-income students for future participation in mainstream settings, such as diverse 4-year colleges or white-collar jobs.  By broadly disseminating the findings from this study to academics, policy makers, and school practitioners, findings could potentially inform school assignment decisions."

Conventional multi-core processors have very inefficient communication, synchronization, and locality-management mechanisms causing them to scale poorly on hard problems and to be difficult to program.  The research proposes to develop a set of efficient  mechanisms - hardware APIs and supporting microarchitecture - for communication, synchronization, and locality management.   Specifically, the project proposes to develop an agile memory hierarchy, register-based communication and synchronization, and fast active messages.  By reducing communication and synchronization overhead by orders of magnitude, it is possible to substantially improve the efficiency, programmability, and scalability of multi-core processors. Overall, the mechanisms will free programmers from the incidental constraints imposed by conventional multi-core architectures - allowing them to concentrate instead on the fundamental issues of parallelism, locality, and load balance.     The proposed work is expected to have an immense impact on future architecture and programming systems for multi-core processors. By reducing communication and synchronization overheads, the mechanisms will enable many applications that are not embarrassingly parallel to benefit from multi-core architectures.

These questions regarding equidistribution can be approached from many angles. Two theories which have proved to be particularly well-suited to study such questions are the spectral theory of automorphic forms, which is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and the theory of dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more general flows on these homogeneous spaces. Recently there has been considerable progress involving tools such as special value formulae for L-functions, and (partial) classification results for measures invariant under higher rank torus actions. Particularly exciting is the possibility, already realized in some instances, of combining these techniques. The purpose of the proposed FRG is to investigate further this circle of ideas, which we believe has the potential to impact many other problems related to the above. The result of these investigations will be a deeper understanding of the dynamics of group actions on homogeneous spaces, of the analytic theory of automorphic forms, and the (sometimes unexpected) applications to problems of  arithmetic nature.    The present project is concerned with a surprising link between two classical fields of mathematics of quite disparate origin: number theory and dynamics. The study of number theory began thousands of years ago, motivated, in significant part, by questions about prime numbers.  On the other hand, ergodic theory and dynamics are mathematical fields of more recent provenance, which arose from studying the long-term evolution of complicated deterministic processes -- such as planetary motion. It is a striking fact (which has only recently begun to be heavily exploited) that, in certain contexts, ideas from ergodic theory interact very deeply with classical problems in number theory.  This project will enhance our understanding of this inter-relation and how we can combine knowledge from both of these fruitful disciplines effectively."

Many of these are central to multi-billion dollar U.S. industries, such as flat-panel TV?s and computer monitors. The atomic-scale structure of these materials controls their properties, which must be tailored to improve performance in their diverse uses. This project seeks to understand general principles of  how variations in the glass composition, and the way that it is heat-treated during manufacturing, change the glass structure in useful ways, to allow properties to be more easily predicted and engineered. The results of these studies should have more general interest as well, in other fields of science where glasses (and the liquids that form glass on cooling) are important, including geosciences and condensed-matter physics. Education is central to this project, since most of the research will be part of the training of Ph.D. and undergraduate students on their ways to careers in science and engineering.    TECHNICAL DETAILS  The most important experimental approach that will be used is solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which provides quantitative details about the structure around many of the components common in technological glasses, including boron, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen. The P.I. and students in this program will synthesize several series of glasses with systematic variations in composition, and measure how glass structure changes. They will vary the thermal history of the glasses to look for clearly important, but poorly-known, effects of temperature. They will analyze results with thermodynamic modeling to allow prediction of critical properties. Much of the current development of improved and new types of glass materials comes from trial-and-error experimentation; it is thus an important goal to develop more fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships. Success with this goal could lead to new ways of thinking about designing glass compositions for new applications. Given major efforts in fundamental glass science in other countries, and the importance of the manufacturing of high-tech glasses in U.S. industry, it seems particularly urgent to progress in more basic understanding of these materials."

Using experimental procedures to be conducted at Cornell University, the investigators will compare subjects? evaluations of workers? files in situations where the law prohibits discrimination and situations in which no law is in place.  The main hypothesis is that laws that protect leave takers from discrimination will not only reduce discriminatory outcomes but also produce more positive evaluations of these workers.  The findings from this study will make important contributions to understanding whether laws can change both behavior and normative belief systems.  Results could also provide scholars with new knowledge and information to understand whether employers will penalize workers when they defy stereotypes that women should be family caretakers and men should be family breadwinners.  Theoretically, the project will collect new data to illuminate whether normative discrimination -- whereby employers discriminate because they believe that mothers should stay at home with their children and fathers should support the family ? is widespread or contingent.  This project offers several broader benefits.  First, the social benefits to workers and families of identifying effective legal reforms are potentially enormous; one estimate is that caretaker bias costs mothers as much as $1 million over the course of their careers.  Second, the project will give both undergraduate and graduate students first-hand experience conducting empirical research.  From past experience, the investigators expect that up to half of these students will be women and/or minorities, increasing the likelihood that these students will pursue scientific careers.  Finally, this project will not only establish a new, interdisciplinary collaboration between UC Berkeley and Cornell, but will also reach out to other innovative organizations focused on work and family issues."

The project will lead to new concepts, the prediction of candidate materials that exhibit topological states, and work with experimentalists to verify their properties.     Search for topological states of matter has become an important goal in condensed matter physics. The quantum Hall state gives the first example of a topological state which is characterized by well defined a topological number and described by the topological field theory at low energy. Recently, the theoretical prediction and the experimental observation of the quantum spin Hall state in mercury telluride-cadmium telluride quantum wells provides another example of a new type of topological state. The quantum spin Hall state is a time-reversal invariant bulk insulator, with gapless edge states where opposite spin states counter-propagate. The PI aims to search and design new materials for the topological insulators in two and three dimensions. He plans to systematically investigate the experimentally measurable topological properties of these systems, including the fractional charge, spin-charge separation and the topological magneto-electric effect. He will also investigate topological Mott insulators where the gap arises from strong electronic correlations.    The PI is dedicated to the supervision of the PhD. Through the Stanford-IBM center for quantum spintronics, graduate students and postdocs also get broad exposure to the challenges facing the semiconductor industry today. The PI has also been invited to present at the annual press conferences of the Semiconductor Industry Association, sharing both the excitement and the urgency of our research with the general public.    NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY  This award supports theoretical research integrated with education to elucidate the novel properties of electrons organized in a new state of matter and to predict new materials or specific existing materials where the state can be found. Insulators have been known for a long time; they are a large class of materials that do not conduct electricity. Recently a new kind of insulator, called a topological insulator, was predicted which does not conduct electrons through the bulk but electrons can flow along the edges without dissipation. Materials that are currently being studied in this context include some consisting of alternating layers of mercury telluride and cadmium telluride, the compound bismuth telluride, and alloys composed of bismuth and antimony. Experiments are consistent with theoretical predictions. The PI will carry out theoretical research to further explore these new states of matter and to predict new materials in which they may arise. The study of topological insulators may lead to a new generation of electronic devices that may help to sustain the rapid growth in performance of information technology.    The PI is dedicated to the supervision of the PhD.

In these domains, the human \"dependent\" is typically connected to multiple other human \"controllers\" (medical specialists, structural engineers, rescue operations officials, etc.) via the robot proxy for long periods of time.  The literature suggests that under these circumstances the dependent will respond to the robot socially, and will become distrustful as well as cognitively confused by a robot that presents a different affect for different controllers rather than a consistent communication strategy.  The PIs believe that such a robot would occupy a novel \"social medium\" position within the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) model, and would be perceived as a loyal and helpful go-between who is an advocate for the dependent rather than as a device for accomplishing the goals of the controllers.  To explore this hypothesis, the PIs will make use of the Survivor Buddy, a multimedia attachment for a robot which allows trapped victims to engage in two-way video conferencing, watch news, listen to music, etc.  Formative experiments will be conducted at Stanford's CHIMe lab, followed by comprehensive, high fidelity experiments at Texas A&M's Disaster City using point-of-injury care scripts developed under prior work with medical doctors and rescue professionals.  The paralinguistic aspects of the associated communication strategy will couple the ongoing work by Nass in voice characteristics and mannerisms with research in affective physical mannerisms in non-anthropomorphic robots under development by Murphy; the intellectual merit of the project thus stems from its multidisciplinary merging of communications and computer science.  The research will introduce the CASA spectrum of relationships as a complement to robot-centric taxonomies, and will define a new relationship where a human is highly dependent upon a medium for long durations along with a new identity of social medium, which the PIs expect will have a greater impact on integrating robots into society than autonomous social actors and tele-operation.  Project outcomes will include creation of a formal and comprehensive communication strategy for HRI, which combines verbal and nonverbal affect; this will unify the theory and practice of social robots, thereby breaking the pattern of ad hoc application of affect currently seen in the robotics literature and establishing the fundamental models and paradigms for continuing basic research in HRI.    Broader Impacts:  This project will ultimately help save the lives of victims of accidents, disasters, and terrorism, and will also generally improve the quality of life for \"shut-ins.\"  The concept of social medium is well-matched to the current capabilities of tele-operation and semi-autonomy in civilian and military robotics; thus, the communication strategies developed will be immediately applicable to domains such as law enforcement and emergency response, which currently use robots, as well as to healthcare, where robots have not yet found a strong economic niche but have huge economic potential.  The educational outreach plan includes multi-disciplinary curriculum development, as well as outreach to K-12 teachers and museums."

Over the past decade, new and exciting technologies have created opportunities for developing rich open-ended learning environments that combine a number of different learning paradigms and resources. Students can complete quests in game environments, engage in inquiry, interact with virtual agents, run science simulations, take quizzes, access the web, and more generally make choices about different learning activities. Our basic insight is that these choices can be extremely informative about student learning and diagnostic of what students can learn once they leave highly scripted curricula. We can use machine learning methods, such as hidden Markov Models and other sequence analysis algorithms to analyze student choices in relatively open learning environments and determine whether students are showing (sub) optimal behavior patterns. The environment can then adapt intelligently by encouraging (alternative) choices and better learning behaviors. Our primary hypothesis is that helping students develop the metacognitive abilities to make learning choices will have strong effects on their subsequent abilities to learn in the future in unstructured and unsupervised but resource-rich environments. Our goals for this project are to create: a) Choice adaptive intelligent learning environments and computational methodologies that help students develop strategies to enable them to learn on their own; b) Novel automated assessment tools for both teachers and students that link choice and learning behaviors to learning performance; and c) Research studies that will establish whether our interventions that combine choice with guidance is beneficial for both strong and weak learners in science domains.    The broader impacts of this work span multiple dimensions. First, it provides an encompassing computer science framework for bringing together a number of technology-rich, interactive environments that are proliferating for education into a common choice filled and adaptive architecture. Second, this choice-based framework provides a paradigm shift in that tracking and theorizing about choice is applied in the context of learning, which, in the past, has been dominated by characterizations of the knowledge construct. Characterizing learning by choice not only connects learning research to a larger body of social science research, it is also a fundamentally new way to characterize and guide learning that is closer to the goal of much instruction, namely intelligent future choice. Third, the computer environment should permit the collection and analysis of large log files by many researchers, and conceivably lead to a new database of common choice patterns and their effects on learning. We will create the framework that enables others to incorporate intelligence into their virtual worlds and help achieve these proposed outcomes."

The problem of providing seamless, integrated querying over multiple  interrelated sources of information has been plaguing the database,  information management, information retrieval, and artificial  intelligence research communities for decades. There have been  successful lines of research addressing specific components of the  data integration problem, and large \"one-off\" systems have been built  that successfully integrate specific information sources in specific  domains. However, a completely general solution to the data  integration problem is thought not to be realizable.    The investigator is developing a new type of information integration  system that is both novel and realizable. It is based on the following  premises and components.    1) The system provides a general data integration solution targeted  for a certain type of environment: when multiple sources have joining,  overlapping, and potentially conflicting information about the same or  closely related real-world entities.    2) The system permits and exploits uncertainty as an integral part of  data integration: Uncertainty may be present in source data, source  schemata, the integration process, integrated schemata, and integrated  data. In fact, uncertainty can play a key role successful information  integration.    3) The system relies on general-purpose entity-resolution as a  fundamental building block of the integration process and the  integrated information. Furthermore, the system retains both the  uncertainty and the lineage associated with the entity-resolution  process.    4) The system incorporates powerful lineage capabilities, tracking  where, when, and how data was produced, how it has evolved over time,  and how it has been combined and manipulated as part of the  integration process. Lineage is used to enhance the integration  process, and it is offered to the end-user in a variety of forms for  data understanding and conflict-resolution purposes.

On one hand, it explores novel analysis of fundamental performance limits for a content-aware Internet ecosystem that rigorously characterizes the benefits of an intelligently designed cross-layer architecture. On the other hand, it includes developing mechanisms and practical implementation of a content distribution system, by which involved parties can interact constructively to achieve these gains yet respect each others' interests. This approach combines a range of techniques, including modeling and theoretical analysis, measurement and data analysis, system design, simulation, and system implementation. Affordable and ready access to digital content helps inform, educate, and entertain society as a whole. Additionally, by developing cost- and resource-effective delivery techniques, the friction continuing to build between involved parties can be reduced and the technical side of the network neutrality debate can be better informed.

This structure was motivated by formalisms in string theory in physics. The idea is to understand how loops (or paths) in a background space can evolve in time. Loops can evolve by changing in size and even breaking apart.  In this proposal this theory is studied in a variety of contexts, including the mathematical formalisms of Quantum Field Theory.

Topological techniques capture qualitative features of geometric objects, such as the presence of loops, spheres, and other surfaces within them in a systematic way which allows it to be used as a tool for geometric pattern recognition in a broad sense.  Interpreted this way, these techniques have applications in areas as diverse as number theory and the solution of algebraic equations on the one end to problems in data analysis on the other end.

The combined strength of high resolution microwave imaging and low-T/high-B environment will enable insights not possible to obtain by other means.  This tool will be very useful for other fields and for education.  Because of the relative ease of operation, the experience of nanoscale electrical imaging is also of pedagogical importance to the undergraduate, graduate students and postdoc in the project."

Toward this end, physicists develop theories in which individual components, such as a site where electrons are bound, interact with each other. Fully testing the predictions of a theory can be difficult, because material parameters are not individually tunable.  This award supports a project that follows an alternative approach.  Well-understood semiconductor materials and advanced patterning techniques are used to build nanoscale sites or ?quantum dots? that trap electrons. The great advantage to this approach is that parameters of the theory, such as the ability for the trapped electron in the dot to interact with the reservoir of electrons in the material, can be controlled electronically.  The project uses this control to drive a drastic change in the electrons? behavior. Usually, one thinks of electrons acting independently, as they do when flowing through a copper wire. In contrast, the quantum dot structure can be tuned so that the electrons behave as a collective entity. This change is analogous to the transition from water to ice, except that it is not caused by temperature but by quantum fluctuations. The effect of quantum fluctuations is much less understood than their classical counterpart, temperature fluctuations. The goal of this project is to observe this quantum phase transition and quantitatively test current theories that seek to explain these phenomena. This project will train students and post-docs in advanced physical theories, semiconductor processing skills, and precision measurement techniques that will prepare them for cutting-edge careers in academia or industry.    ****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****  A crucial challenge in the field of correlated electron physics is to find an experimental system that corresponds to an interacting many-body Hamiltonian and allows fine control over the parameters of the Hamiltonian. This award supports a project that will meet the challenge by using well-understood AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures and advanced patterning techniques to fabricate gated nano-structures. In these structures, small droplets of electrons called quantum dots are isolated from the remaining electron reservoirs. The two Hamiltonians of interest are the two-channel Kondo and the two-impurity Kondo Hamiltonians.  In the two-channel Kondo system two independent reservoirs of delocalized electrons compete to screen an electron spin bound to the localized site (a quantum dot).  In the two-impurity Kondo Hamiltonian an electron reservoir and a spin on a localized site compete to screen another spin on a second localized site.  The advantage of using gated quantum dots is that parameters such as inter-dot interactions and dot-reservoir tunneling rates can be precisely measured and electrostatically tuned. This project will utilize this control to drive a quantum phase transition between a Fermi liquid and a non-Fermi liquid state. The goal is to tune to the very sensitive quantum critical point and quantitatively test theoretical predictions of how the highly-correlated non-Fermi liquid state evolves into the more conventional Fermi liquid state under the influence of relevant perturbations such as magnetic field and exchange coupling. This project will provide valuable training to students and post-docs in advanced many-body theories, semiconductor processing skills, and precision measurement techniques that will prepare them for cutting-edge careers in academia or industry."

The covariance parameter is the natural parameter of interest when exploring complex relationships between many variables in parametric models. Current methodology on high dimensional covariance estimation has focused on regularizing or putting zeros in the covariance matrix or its inverse using methods based on the lasso. Though very useful, these methods do not address some of the glaring gaps in the literature. First it is well known that lasso and similar penalization methods yield sparse models and estimators - yet a formal undertaking of the spectral properties of regularized covariance estimators or those of random matrices that arise naturally in graphical models is not available in the literature. This gap in the literature will be addressed. Second, an important class of models that have recently received much attention are the so-called covariance graph models. These models encode marginal independences in multivariate distributions and thus can yield more parsimonious representations. A comprehensive framework for Bayesian inference and model selection for this class of models is not available. This important class of problems is investigated in this project. One of the original justifications for the need for covariance regularized estimation is that the covariance matrix features in the mean estimation problem, and when constructing confidence intervals for the mean (for instance in MANOVA), or in regression yet there is relatively very little work in the area of covariance regularization required for the specific needs of regression. A generalized framework which investigates the merits of using the covariance matrix of the explanatory variables for regression purposes is undertaken, thereby providing insights into obtaining better estimators for regression coefficients than those suggested by standard methods.     In recent years, the availability of high-throughput data from genomic, finance, environmental, marketing (among other) applications has created an urgent need for methodology and tools for analyzing high-dimensional data. Making sense of all the many complex relationships that are in the data, formulating correct models and developing inferential procedures is one of the major challenges facing statisticians today, and also those working in applied fields. This project proposes to tackle some of the pressing questions that arise when exploring multivariate dependencies in high dimensions. As a concrete application, the methodology developed in this project will be used to understand the interconnectedness of genes in cancer studies and cardiovascular medicine, while maintaining the statistical rigor and ease of interpretability of previously developed methods. Hence a project of this nature will have widespread applications, as understanding relationships between many variables or players is an endeavor that is common to many scientific disciplines. The proposed work, though rooted in the principles of statistics, is interdisciplinary, and involves collaborations with biomedical scientists, engineers and the environmental scientists."

The project studies high dimensional settings exemplified by Linear Regression model selection when there are more potential predictors than observations, and Linear Discriminant Analysis when there are more available features than observations, in both cases assuming that only a small unknown fraction are relevant.  A two-dimensional phase diagram indexes the ratio of number of variables to number of observations as well as a measure of the fraction of relevant variables.  In one region of this diagram, the analysis task can be completed successfully, elsewhere it fails utterly. The investigators propose a four-pronged effort on dimensionality reduction: (1) Phenomenology of Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Data Analysis: Make structured large-scale computational studies to investigate several such transitions in depth and expose empirical regularities for theoreticians to study.  (2) Theoretical Statistics Supporting High-Dimensional Data Analysis: Proposers have developed `at the physicist's level of rigor' a derivation showing roughly that regression model selection must fail for *any* algorithm above a certain boundary in the phase diagram.  A rigorous proof, planned for this project, will involve the interplay of classical statistical decision theory, random matrix theory, and statistical physics heuristics.  (3) High Dimensional Convex Geometry: A surprising but revealing relationship exists between several of the phase transitions of high-dimensional data analysis and certain key phenomena in high-dimensional convex geometry. The project will further explore these phase transitions and connections.  (4) Inference with Large Random Matrices: A random matrix theory perspective leads to useful new questions and results in classical multivariate analysis that will be pursued in this proposal, with useful connections with the phase transition work expected.  For example, the project will systematically study the distribution of the largest root statistic at ``contiguous'' alternatives in a variety of the standard statistical settings of multivariate analysis, and address related questions such as tail inequalities for the double Wishart model.     Scientific practice in fields ranging from computational biology to image understanding generates ever more datasets in which massive numbers of features are measured per observational unit.  The resulting high-dimensional datasets are often mined for features and associations. In many cases, there are at least as many features as observations.  It has lately become clear that data analysis in this setting offers deep new phenomena of real importance to applications. Two examples -- of many -- include: Linear Regression model selection when there are more potential predictors than observations, but only a small fraction of these are relevant (and which ones aren't known), and Linear Discriminant Analysis when there are more available features than observations, but again only a small unknown fraction are relevant.  In such cases there is a `breakdown' phenomenon, described by a 'phase diagram': a precise relationship between the number of relevant features and the number of observations at which certain procedures for learning from data become impossible.  The new results to be developed about this phenomenon by this project will provide practitioners of high-dimensional data analysis with an improved understanding of the sharp limits to data mining, as well as forging new links between statistical theory and fields like high-dimensional convex geometry and statistical physics."

Atomistic modeling and controlled experiments on NW nucleation and growth kinetics will be carried out so as to provide direct comparisons.

What is the mechanism of NW nucleation on dif-ferent substrates and how does it relate to the observed deep sub-eutectic nucleation reported in some catalyst-NW systems? Q2. What mechanisms control normal NW growth and result in growth abnormalities (e.g. kinking)? Q3. What is the mechanism of the termination of NW growth (catalyst nanoparticle solidification)? Using the Si/Ge NW system as a test bed, in situ and ex situ measurements during CVD growth at controlled temperature and pressure conditions will be compared with numerical predictions, validating and guiding the development of compu-tational methods to overcome time scale challenges in the modeling of nucleation events.

Nontechnical explanation: The uppermost 200 kilometers of geologically stable regions behaves nearly rigidly over geological times. The temperature in this region, called the lithosphere, gradually increases with depth. The rock near the base of the lithosphere deforms slowly as a very viscous fluid. Cold material sinks into the underlying mantle and hot material rises from below. Thermal conduction through the rigid lithosphere carries heat to the surface.  Scientists constrain the temperature change by studying rocks that were carried quickly from great depths to the surface in diamond pipes. The proposed work involves the physics of heat and mass transfer at the base of the lithosphere. This process occurs everywhere on the Earth. Over geological time, it determines whether continents are above or below sea level and strongly influences the depositional history of hydrocarbon-bearing sediments in basins where subsidence occurs. The investigation will include related topics on the long-term habitability of planets, including the axes of mid-oceanic ridges that spread at rates below 2 kilometers per million years. The heat and mass transfer computer code developed for the project has proved useful for understanding the thermodynamic basis of widely used empirical relationships that represent time-dependent friction in geological situations including earthquakes as well as industrial applications.    Technical description: The project involves dynamic effects that occur at the base of the lithosphere or equivalently at the base of tectonic plates. The lack of tectonics in cratonal continental crust (older than ~2.5 billion years) is a salient feature of the Earth. Data from xenoliths erupted from diamond pipes provide hard constraints on physical models. Cratonal lithosphere approached its present thickness, about 200 kilometers, soon after it formed before 2.5 billion years ago and has persisted since then.   The second key observation from xenoliths is that the rheologically active boundary layer (the zone of active flow) at the base of the lithosphere has a temperature range of less than 200 K. The investigation will focus on observable processes. Thermal convection occurs within the basal transition region (the rheological boundary layer) between the lithosphere and the underlying nearly adiabatic mantle. The overlying nearly rigid cold lithosphere provides a stagnant lid. The lithosphere cools and subsides when the basal convective heat flow (plus lithosphere radioactive heat generation) is less than the heat flow through the surface. This situation prevails in young ocean lithosphere, which subsides as it ages. Convective heat flow comes into quasi-equilibrium with surface heat flow below stable continental regions. Cratons with crust typically over 2.5 billion years old have chemically buoyant highly viscous lithosphere that provides a chemical lid to convection.  Lithosphere that differs only thermally from deeper mantle provides a stagnant lid beneath younger platform crust. At present, the Earth is in a state where the lithosphere beneath platforms is almost as thick as that beneath cratons. That is, the chemical-lid convection beneath cratons is transitional to stagnant-lid convection. (1) The proposal concentrates on the scaling and 3-D numerical physics of the transition including 3-D effects from the disruption of convection by changes in plate motion. (2) Mantle plumes of hot buoyant material ascend from great depths and impinge on the base of the lithosphere. The buoyant material ponds beneath the lithosphere and flows laterally toward thin lithosphere like oil beneath pack ice. The plume material convectively exchanges heat with the lithosphere, thinning it. Scaling relationships and 3-D numerical models indicate that situations that favor vigorous thinning also favor vigorous lateral flow. The duration at a given place of thinning and lateral flow is thus brief, except above a slowly moving plume-tail orifice. The proposal concentrates on 3-D modeling of real features. (3) The proposal begins physical investigation of ultraslow ridge axes with kinematic thermal models."

Removing large herbivores causes a doubling of rodent densities because large herbivores compete with smaller ones for food. These increases in rodent density can cause increases in the density of fleas that transmit human diseases such as plague. This project will use small-scale experiments in Kenya to test whether these increases in flea densities result in greater abundances of fleas infected with disease-causing pathogens. The researchers will also test whether these associations occur in several regions of Tanzania. The experiments in Tanzania will be carried out in landscapes in which large mammals are protected and landscapes in which they are not. Using this combination of careful experiments and large-scale comparisons will allow the researchers to test first whether the effects of large herbivores on infectious disease transmission can occur, and then whether they actually do occur.    The results of this study will advance our understanding of the ecological consequences of worldwide declines in the abundance of large mammals.

The carbon dynamics of tropical forests are dependent on climatic conditions, such as cloud coverage, solar radiation, and temperature. At short time scales, i.e. within a year, climate influences forest productivity directly by controlling rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Over longer periods, climate changes may alter forest 3D structure and composition, but this is difficult to determine because large areas of forest are needed to assess this, and collection of field data can be problematical. Thus, studying the spatial and temporal interactions among forest structure, composition and carbon dynamics requires new methods.

Research activities will be focused on two areas: (1) pathogens in tropical marine waters and (2) marine toxins and pharmaceutical lead discovery. This new research follows logically from accomplishments and discoveries made during the first phase of PRCMB funding.     The pathogen and pathogen indicator work will focus on two streams that discharge to the ocean, one tropical (Kaelepulu on the island of Oahu) and the other temperate (San Pedro Creek in California). Monthly sampling at the two streams will be used to characterize seasonal variability in pathogen indicators and pathogen (bacterial and viral) concentrations using both culture-dependent and culture-independent (PCR-based) methods. These studies will be complemented by high-frequency sampling (ten-minute and hourly) during storm and dry-weather conditions to provide insights concerning spatial and temporal variability. Health-risk models (Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment) will be developed using pathogen and pathogen indicator concentrations as input.     The marine toxin work will concern ciguatoxin and beta?{methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), both of which were the focus of recent PRCMB studies. Taking advantage of (1) the refinement of an assay (n2a) that is now capable of detecting ciguatoxin in fish tissue at concentrations ten times below the threshold associated with ciguatera symptomology and (2) a collaboration with Hawaiian recreational fishermen, PRCMB scientists will extract and concentrate sufficient ciguatoxin from fish tissue to obtain a molecular structure and will then, in collaboration with scientists at the University of Washington, work toward the development of an antibody-based assay for ciguatoxin. Ciguatoxin research will also involve (1) exploratory refinement of the n2a assay based on generation of nitric oxide by the n2a cell line and (2) an investigation of environmental conditions that trigger ciguatoxin production by taxonomically defined strains of the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus. The BMAA work will build on initial studies to determine the prevalence of BMAA in marine cyanobacteria and the transfer of this toxin to higher trophic levels. The pharmaceutical studies will take advantage of the more than 2,500 microbial isolates in the PRCMB culture collection that have not yet been screened for bioactivity. Extracts of these cultures will be used in cell-based and molecular assays to determine if they affect the growth of microbial pathogens (Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphlyococcus aureus, multi-drug resistant S. aureus, and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium) or if they exert effects on human adenocarcinma cells, on protein kinase C, or on mitogen-activated protein kinase. Identification of the compounds responsible for reproducible bioactivity in these extracts will be accomplished through bioassay-guided fractionation and spectroscopic analysis (e.g., mass spectrometry, high-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry)     The broader impacts of the proposed work fall into several categories. One is certainly the public health endpoints: (i) credible methods that can be used to determine whether coastal waters are safe for recreational use, (ii) a simple, inexpensive assay for ciguatoxin in fish, (iii) a better appreciation of the threat to human health associated with the movement of BMAA through marine food chains, and (iv) the discovery of novel compounds with application to the treatment of human health problems. Second, this is a collaborative proposal with an historically black university (Jackson State University) and a female principal investigator from Stanford. Finally, the PRCMB will continue to train students and to collaborate with other institutions and Ocean and Human Health centers."

Non-technical Explanation:  It is generally believed that with adequate monitoring it is possible to detect premonitory signals prior to volcanic eruptions.  Eruptions are often preceded by swarms of earthquakes and bulging of the volcano as magma rises from the earth?s mantle into the crust.  However, the length of the period of` ?unrest? can vary greatly, and eruptions can be either explosive or passive (effusive).  Major goals of volcano science are to provide more accurate forecasts of future behavior based on physical and chemical models of the eruptive process combined with seismic and geodetic monitoring.  The 2004-08 eruption of Mount St. Helens provides a unique opportunity to develop such methods.  This episode erupted magma with essentially the same chemical composition as the devastating 1980 eruption; however this eruption was very gas poor and thus non-explosive.  The 2004 onset was preceded by only a few days of seismic activity and no detectable ground deformation.  We will develop rigorous physical and chemical based models of the eruption and test these against observed seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of ground deformation.    Technical Description: We will develop physically-based models of magma chambers and conduits that are coupled to the elastic surroundings.  As magma ascends the decrease in pressure results in volatile exsolution.  This decreases magma density, but increases viscosity and compressibility.  Exsolution also promotes microlite crystallization; at roughly 1 km depth at MSH the magma becomes essentially a solid plug, the upward motion of which is resisted by frictional sliding on its margins.  Changes in chamber pressure as well as shear and normal tractions on the conduit walls are used to predict surface deformation, which can be compared to GPS data. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversions will be used to determine posterior probability distributions for magma chamber depth, shape, volume, initial overpressure, and recharge, given the GPS data and estimates of extrusion volume.  We will model the cessation of the eruption in January of 2008, and surface deformation data since that time, to better constrain the rate of recharge into the crustal magma chamber.  We will determine whether rate and state dependent friction effects on the boundary of the shallow magma plug can explain both the onset of the eruption ? increasing pressure overcomes frictional resistance which then weakens with sliding ? and also the rapid early deflation observed at the one continuous GPS site operating at the eruption onset.    We will also test possible explanations of cyclic ground tilt observed in the crater of Mount St. Helens. Preliminary analysis suggests that the tilts may be due to shear on the margin of the plug near the bend in the conduit, where ascending magma is redirected to the south beneath the 1980?s lava dome before extruding onto the surface.  We suggest that careful analysis of accurately located earthquakes associated with the tilts will provide important clues to the processes controlling both seismogenesis and extrusion.  For example, variations in the depths of shallow earthquakes during tilt events might point toward migrating slip on the margin of the plug."

The project operates along three lines, combining tools from Asynchronous Variational Integrators (AVIs) and Kinetic Data Structures (KDSs) with a novel effort to perform and exploit qualitative analysis of contact simulation data. The first investigation will show that AVIs, meant to handle the continuous aspects of the physics, can be ntegrated well with KDSs, meant to handle discrete geometric events. The second research component addresses the fundamental problem of event scheduling when future trajectories are uncertain. Methods will be explored that improve event detection times, reduce the number of auxiliary events that have to be processed, and allow events to be processed in parallel.   The third research task will be to initiate a study of the qualitative behavior of contact simulation by building a hierarchy of coarser models which can then be used for better resource allocation, for the validation of various approximations, and in improved simulation design to attain desired effects."

Compared to conventional time accurate methods, the SD-TS method has the potential to significantly reduce the computational cost of simulating time periodic flows. The extension to moving boundaries is needed to enable application of the high order SD methodology to perform accurate simulations of numerous devices in energy and transportation systems, such as wind turbines, rotorcraft and autonomous flapping wing micro air vehicles. Recent development of the SD method by the principal investigator and his colleagues has confirmed it accuracy, robustness and efficiency in dealing with high Reynolds number turbulent flows. The SD method offers a great flexibility in choosing optimal spatial discretization by varying the polynomial order. A baseline SD code has been developed based on quadrilateral/hexahedral grid elements. An element splitting algorithm has also been developed to partition each triangular/tetrahedral element into three or four quadrilateral/hexahedral elements. This enables the use of general grids with mixed elements. For time-dependent high-Reynolds number problems, implicit Lower-Upper Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) time stepping approach has been developed in conjunction with a p-multigrid method to speed up convergence of the SD solver.  In order to achieve the above goal of treating devices as complex as a rotating wind turbine, the proposed research must address several major challenges. The main tasks being undertaken in the ongoing research by the investigator and his colleagues are 1) Extension of the SD method to moving and deformable grids by transforming the Navier-Stokes equations on a moving physical domain to a fixed reference domain by a blended mapping technique; 2) Parallelization of the three-dimensional solver using MeTis for domain decomposition and MPI for message passing; 3) Development of non-conforming hexahedral elements with hanging nodes to allow geometric flexibility and variable order; 4) Implementation of the Time Spectral method to reduce the computational cost of simulating periodic time dependent flows.     The numerical simulation techniques being developed in this project are crucial to advancing technology in a wide range of energy and transportation systems, with significant potential for reducing environmental impact. Many such systems require simulations of flows with moving boundaries. An immediate target of the research is to improve the state of the art in wind turbine design. The importance of sustainable energy both to reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil supplies and to reduce environmental damage due to fossil fuels is by now widely recognized. Wind power is a resource with tremendous untapped potential. Existing commercial flow simulation codes use low order methods which are too numerically dissipative to allow accurate tracking of the vortex wake which are crucial to wind turbine performance. The high order methods which will result from this project will provide a basis for the systematic future development of superior wind turbine designs. Potential applications to transportation systems which could have significant economic and environmental benefits include drag reduction of road vehicles, both passenger cars and trucks, and improvements in the efficiency and reduction of the acoustic signature of gas turbines and rotorcraft, both of which incorporate moving blades."

This research addresses several fundamental problems with this approach: Which of multiple Nash equilibria is selected?  How rapidly does a system converge to such an equilibrium?  How can one influence these dynamics?  Leveraging recent advances in theoretical computer science, efficient algorithms will be developed to answer such questions.    The expression \"social network\" refers to a population of individuals together with their one-to-one social relationships (which can be of personal or economic nature).  It is clear that the structure of such a network deeply affects the behavior of society as a whole (in particular, from the economic point of view).  This intuition has never become practical or quantitative due to the lack of detailed data on the structure and dynamics of social networks.  The Internet, and in particular the success of online social networking is dramatically changing this situation.  This project aims at developing mathematical models and algorithms urgently needed to harness this data explosion.  It will open the way to the application of economic analysis tools to this new arena, and thus facilitate new ways of exploiting online networks."

How does competition influence innovation? This project takes a unique approach to understand this question: It develops an evidence-based simulation platform to understand how competitive dynamics influences innovation. This approach contributes new knowledge to technology strategy and a transformative new tool for science and technology policy.     Intellectual Merit: There are three main contributions. First, a computational multi-agent search theory is developed and evaluated for environments with complex interactions of competing agents. The results help understand search for innovation when multiple agents search simultaneously, and develop computational representations of it. Second, qualitative observations on innovation and competition are made through structured interviews in a real technology-based industry. The goal is to provide theoretically informed answers to an enduring question in technology strategy: What are the most effective firm-level innovation search strategies in competitive markets? Third, a software research tool called ASaP is developed by integrating insights from the computational and strategy components of this project. This simulation tool makes it possible to perform \"live\" simulations of industry data, similar to physical simulations in engineering. Scholars and public policy makers can use this tool to understand the ways in which their recommendations are likely to play out and therefore help design effective policies to manage competition and simultaneously promote innovation.    Broader Impacts: The results of the project can be used not only by academics to analyze competition and innovation rigorously but also by business and policy analysts to improve innovativeness of firms and industries, and thus ultimately advance economic productivity. To foster such progress, the ASaP tool is made publicly available to scholars and practitioners through a website, thus lowering the barrier of entry to computational analysis in general, and predictive analysis of business data in particular. During the current difficult economic times, it is more important than ever to remain innovative, both to resist deeper downturn and to bring our technology-based economy back to a growth trajectory. The ASaP tool serves as a live model of the data, and thus  can be used to identify the sequence of events that generated the data, and modified to find out what would have happened if some factors (such as supporting the livelihood of certain players in the industry over others) had been different. In essence, ASaP makes it possible to study the archival data interactively in laboratory-like experiments, and it can therefore lead to insights on science and technology policy that are not possible to obtain otherwise."

Bird, Mr. Brian F. Codding will examine the material (i.e., archaeologically visible) residues that result from variability in gendered foraging activities among Martu, an indigenous group who live in remote communities in Australia's Western Desert. Today, many Martu hunt and gather on a daily basis. A typical foraging bout begins with a foraging party travelling together to a temporary day-camp from which men and women usually operate separately, engaging in mutually exclusive foraging activities that occur in different habitats (e.g., men may target hill kangaroo while women focus on sand monitor lizards). After several hours, the party regroups at the day-camp to cook, process, share and consume most of the food acquired during the day. The group then typically returns to the community, leaving behind the material remains of the day's activities.      Because gender differences in labor are common in almost all human societies but are rare among other primates, questions about why humans have such differences and why they vary lie at the heart of many influential arguments about the evolutionary origins of human family formation and cooperative social organization. Yet despite its importance, there is little agreement among anthropologists and archaeologists about when and why gendered occupations became prominent features of human social arrangements. Addressing these issues requires an understanding of how archaeological residues represent the gendered foraging decisions made by individuals. However, since the archaeological record is an accumulation of individual behaviors, materials do not read as a straightforward window to individual subsistence practices. In order to work towards a solution to this problem, this research will quantify observed foraging behavior and the linked material remains deposited at each camp. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the archaeological consequences of foraging behavior and how these are related to gendered decisions about resource use. By combining observational data with the analysis of its material residues, this work aims to provide the tools necessary to examine gendered foraging decisions in the past through the residues of foraging alone. Developing such clear archaeological signatures of the gender division of foraging labor will contribute directly toward understanding a wide range of issues in human prehistory, from the emergence of the genus Homo to processes of economic and political intensification.    This research also has the potential to provide a broader impact on the public's understanding of these issues. Specifically, this work provides the funds to train one PhD student and Martu research assistants who will help with the duration of the project in archaeological survey and excavation techniques. This training will provide an important background for Martu who are actively involved in the management and preservation of their cultural heritage. Working directly with Parnngurr Community School and the Parnngurr Community Council, the results of this research will also be publicized through collaborative websites. In so doing, this work aims to provide a deeper public understanding of the range of variability in family dynamics and their material expressions."

The project investigates statistical software analysis, which infers  relationships among program components by using statistical properties  derived from multiple program executions.    To motivate statistical techniques, it is useful to draw analogies to  static analysis methods. Static analysis is about inferring  dependencies between program components: If a value is changed in one  component, how does that affect a value in a different component?  Static analysis tends to work best for properties that are local,  meaning the pieces of the program we are trying to relate are not  separated by a great deal of other computation. The statistical analog  of dependencies is correlation. Instead of proving definitively via  static reasoning the presence or absence of dependencies, we can  observe at run-time that some properties of two components have high  or low correlation. Importantly, correlation is not affected by  syntactic or even dynamic locality: if two components have a  correlation, regardless of how much time or computation passes between  the execution of one component and the execution of the other, this  correlation can be detected if the appropriate statistical question is  asked.    The initial focus is on using cross-correlation, which which computes  the maximum correlation between two sequences of observations, to  formalize statistical correlation between software components that  have a direction in time. This idea gives rise to a natural graph that  captures the strength and direction of statistical influence one  component has upon another; these graphs are analogous to traditional  dependency graphs, but have unique and useful properties."

In the theory of overconvergent classical modular forms,  the canonical subgroup of Lubin and Katz (for a p-adic analytic family of elliptic curves) has been an important tool. The recent interest in p-adic modular forms beyond the classical case has motivated several different constructions of canonical subgroups for abelian varieties,  and recent work of the PI has led to another higher-dimensional theory   that, at least in its geometric aspects, has a wider range of applicability than the other approaches. The PI proposes to use deformation-theoretic methods to make explicit certain abstract estimates in the theory, and to draw   arithmetic consequences for p-adic families of automorphic forms.  In another direction,  the PI and co-workers have used methods from   deformation theory and rigid-analytic geometry to develop a theory of a   new global parity obstruction to randomness properties of prime   specialization of inseparable irreducible polynomials over  certain coordinate rings of curves over finite fields.  This has given   rise to families of elliptic curves with unexpected rank behavior  over global function fields (under some standard conjectures) and seems   likely to have further Diophantine applications  to Mordell--Weil ranks for families of abelian varieties over global   function fields. The PI proposes to develop a better  understanding of this basic arithmetic phenomenon and to work out some   further consequences for ranks in families.    Number theory is among the oldest subjects in mathematics, since it is   ultimately concerned with the relatively concrete  problem of studying properties of whole numbers.  Such problems can   take on the form of finding whole number solutions  to systems of equations in many variables, or problems relating to   properties of primes, and so on. Typically one has to bring in some deeper structural information (provided by geometric, algebraic, or analytic ideas) to make progress on such questions, and in the last several decades a very wide range of sophisticated geometric techniques have been developed to attack these problems.  Moreover, though the initial motivation comes from within pure mathematics, security of  electronic telecommunications has come to be related in an essential way to many of these number-theoretic problems (such as  prime factorization and studying points on curves over finite fields)   and the geometric concepts used to attack them.  This proposal focuses  on both geometric and prime factorization questions that arise in   several number-theoretic settings, aiming to develop some  new theoretical methods and to apply them to specific problems.  In   addition, the PI proposes to continue his long-standing tradition of supervising high-level number theory research by talented high school students and giving talks to larger groups of students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.  He will also complete two books that, together with assorted freely available notes already posted on his web site, will provide useful references for graduate students who wish to learn about some fundamental topics in arithmetic geometry."

The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of charge separation and recombination in photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) and the higher-order organization of photosynthetic membranes.  This research project focuses on three areas:  (i) the mechanism of electron transfer in RCs where the primary electron acceptor has been removed; (ii) the use of vibrational spectator probes to quantify electrostatics in the RC; and (iii) the development of advanced imaging techniques using well-defined photosynthetic complexes and assemblies as a model system.  By working with RCs in which normal electron transfer is blocked, new pathways can be revealed in a clean background and important intermediates can be trapped.  In particular, the kinetics and energetics of electron transfer along the ordinarily non-functional side of the RC can be studied in depth.  This project will investigate the orientation of a particular amino acid that is believed to modulate reaction energetics.  A suite of methods will introduce spectator vibrational probes into the RC to measure differences in electrostatic fields in symmetry-related positions, as well as probe changes in fields as electron transfer occurs.  Areas (i) and (ii) focus on specific, well-defined questions that arise in bacterial photosynthesis; the results and methods will apply to more complex photosynthetic organisms and the broad area of biological electron transfer.  Area (iii) uses photosynthetic systems, but will impact the development of new approaches for characterizing membranes and membrane proteins in general.  Imaging mass spectrometry will be pushed to its limit using the highly organized photosynthetic membrane, in particular to see whether integral membrane protein organization can be visualized.  A \"membrane interferometer\" has been developed that combines advanced fabrication, membrane assembly and optics in a device that is highly sensitive to membrane curvature and osmotic pressure.  Photosynthetic proteins will be used to test the precision of this interferometer, to test hypotheses concerning the impact of photosynthetic membrane proteins on membrane curvature and budding, and as reporters of membrane curvature upon incorporation of channels that are sensitive to membrane tension.    Sustained support in this area has led to the development of many new approaches for studying electron transfer reactions, one of the most important classes of reactions in physical and biological systems.  Nearly every spectroscopic, structural, and theoretical method has been applied to some aspect of RC and photosynthetic membrane function.  In many cases this was the first example of new physical approaches applied to a biological problem, often leading to significant improvements in the physical and theoretical methods, and these concepts and methods are now used in many other fields.  Assembly of RCs on surfaces opened an entirely new area of technology, membrane patterning, which is now used in many laboratories and is the basis of efforts to use membrane and membrane-protein arrays for screening in several biotechnology companies.  This general area of research has been a tremendous source of training for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, often serving as a bridge between the physical sciences and biology.  The PI has given more than 100 invited talks at universities, national labs, companies and scientific conferences worldwide over the past 5 years.  Viewed in broadest terms, concepts and results from photosynthesis research have impacted solar energy research and the emerging area of molecular electronics."

These reactions all involve the activation of oxygen by very similar binuclear iron active sites. Intermediates can be trapped in these reactions and small binuclear iron designed peptides are available as models for these enzyme active sites. This research project involves using a wide variety of spectroscopic techniques combined with quantum mechanical calculations to understand the reaction mechanisms of this large class of enzymes and how apparently similar binuclear iron active sites perform very different functions. The achievement of these goals, in part, requires the development of new spectroscopic methods and definition of their information content from quantum theory. These studies define geometric and electronic structural contributions to O-O bond cleavage. Research also focuses on defining structural contributions to the complementary reaction of O-O bond formation by manganese cluster sites in photosynthesis.

The insights derived from these studies are being applied toward the development of new heterogeneous and bio-inspired catalysts. New spectroscopic methods, developed as part of this research program, have applications to a wide range of problems in chemistry, biology, materials and environmental sciences. The spectroscopic/electronic structure expertise of this research program is made available to the scientific community through a wide range of collaborations, which also leverage the impact of this research.

Political psychology is a thriving field of inquiry with roots in political science and connections to a range of other social sciences. Political psychologists attempt to understand the psychological underpinnings, roots, and consequences of political behavior. Some of this work attempts to understand political phenomena by applying and enhancing theories developed through research done in psychological laboratories. Findings regarding mediation and moderation of real-world effects have often led to extensions and revisions of political and psychological theories. Other political psychology involves the development of completely new theory to provide psychological accounts of political phenomena, thus contributing to basic understanding of how the mind works in the important context of politics.     In light of the vitality of the field and growing graduate student interest, the idea of establishing a summer training institute in political psychology was developed. The Summer Institute in Political Psychology (SIPP) is a 3-week program designed to advance the research capabilities of graduate students from around the world studying political science, psychology, and other social sciences. The Summer Institute has aimed to enrich the graduate training of participants by offering a broad and intensified complement to the classroom training that is usually available at graduate institutions. By bringing together a large set of faculty offering lectures on a diverse set of topics, SIPP exposed graduate students to (1) a broad range of research literature in political psychology, (b) the research styles and approaches of an array of scholars working in political psychology, and (c) training in the varied set of research methods employed by political psychologists, as well as (d) creating inter-disciplinary networks among the participants to support their on-going research efforts and cement their long-term commitments to social science scholarship.     One of the best ways to enhance research productivity in political psychology over the long term is to recruit and train talented, energetic, and motivated cohorts of scholars to join the field. SIPP does just this and thus enhances the vitality of political psychology's contributions to social science literatures."
0921134,High-resolution records of atmospheric circulation and past rainfall from soils based on U-series and stable isotope SIMS approaches,EAR,SURFACE EARTH PROCESS SECTION,"August 15, 2009","July 30,  2009","Maher, Katharine",CA,Stanford University,Standard Grant,Enriqueta Barrera,"July 31,  2012",355865,,kmaher@stanford.edu,340 Panama Street,STANFORD,CA,94305,6507232300,GEO,7570,OTHR|6890|0000,0000099    Other Applications NEC                  |,0921134,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).    There are relatively few records that reflect large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation during the last glacial-interglacial cycle, and very few with sufficient temporal resolution and/or continuity to resolve the timing and sequence of changes. To understand how these changes occurred in the past, terrestrial climate records that are sensitive to changes in precipitation are necessary. Although there are a substantial number of short-term high-resolution terrestrial paleoclimate records, there are relatively few records that span the last few glacial-interglacial cycles. These sparse records have proven insufficient to resolve the mechanisms behind the large-scale shifts in effective moisture that occurred during glacial-interglacial transitions. In addition, it has been challenging to resolve the effects of temperature and changes in moisture source from changes in the amount of precipitation using existing proxy data.    Intellectual merit: This project will develop high-spatial resolution analytical approaches using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to provide spatially and temporally continuous records of climate and atmospheric circulation over the last few glacial-interglacial transitions (10 to 200 ka) using pedogenic opal. 230Th-U SIMS dating will be complimented by the development of multi-isotope proxies in order to develop high-temporal spatial resolution records that connect to form a regional grid, and are thus uniquely capable of reflecting past changes in atmospheric circulation. Specifically, the investigator will test the hypothesis that uranium isotopic and trace element variations in dated pedogenic opal provide a robust archive of paleoprecipitation. Changes in moisture sources will be detected using &#948;18O, and changes in weathering intensity will be assessed using &#948;30Si. The existing geochronological records from soils show variations in initial (234U/238U) activity ratios and trace elements over the last 200 ka. The investigator hypothesizes that initial (234U/238U) variations are recording changes in past rainfall amounts. However, the exact mechanism for these variations must be more closely examined before quantitative data can be developed. Therefore prior to expanding her network of soil sites, she proposes to test the concordance of the initial (234U/238U) values and the validity of the U-series proxy using the modern soil system. Development and validation of the U-series proxy would enable paleoclimate information to be extracted directly from the geochronologic measurements of soils and could potentially be extended to speleothem.    Broader impacts: This research will have important implications for our understanding of the rates and mechanisms of climate change in terrestrial environments. By working with the climate modeling community, the data and network of sites will provide unique and much needed calibration data that will greatly improve the ability to predict and understand the current changes in atmospheric circulation. As the samples she plans to analyze are modern analogues for paleosols, the approaches and understanding she develops will also have important implications for these materials and may enable new records to be developed at key intervals back in Earth?s history. To make her records available, she will host a database of published U-series data at Stanford, and work with other scientists to include existing records. Secondly, she will work with the outreach program in the School of Earth Sciences at Stanford. She plans to: 1) accept high school interns to work with her in the field and in her laboratory, 2) work with the K-12 program ?Expanding Your Horizons? to develop a module describing the climate system, how it varied in the past, and how it has influenced the landscape of both the local environment and greater California."

Even when cleaner technologies are available, individuals, business and organizations may be slow to adopt them.      This project examines the factors that lead small businesses to adopt a specific new kind of 'green' technology.  The study focuses on the dry cleaning industry in several U.S. states.  Dry cleaners can choose to adopt new 'green' cleaning methods.  These methods require purchasing expensive new equipment, and business owners may be uncertain whether their customers value 'green' cleaning, or whether the results of the 'green' process is good enough to satisfy their consumers.  A formal structural econometric model is estimated with the data to determine whether competition between cleaners encourages firms to adopt the technology.  The resulting model of the entire cleaning industry allows us to evaluate the driving forces behind the adoption of new green technology in this industry.    The results of this project allow us to predict the likely effect of government incentives designed to encourage firms to adopt the new technology.  This part of the project is a direct broader impact that will guide policymakers and may benefit citizens by improving the environment."

The project will explore firms' responses both in terms of pricing of home sales versus exports, and in terms of participation and sales in domestic and export markets. The project will make use of a unique proprietary data set that merges the plant census for Ireland (a small open economy) with the survey of prices used to construct the producer price index. The first stage of the project involves merging and cleaning the data. The second stage of the project investigates the extent and nature of pricing-to-market and the significance of price stickiness among a particular group of exporters. Preliminary results are suggestive of slow passthrough of exchange rate changes into import prices. Given evidence of more rapid passthrough at higher levels of aggregation, this suggests that entry and exit of products and exporters may be crucial to understanding real exchange rate movements. The third stage of the project investigates the response of participation and sales in home and export markets to movements in exchange rates.  Intellectual merit: The novelty of this project lies in the unique features of the data set. For the purpose of identifying pricing-to-market and pricing behavior, we know that the products we focus on are actually traded, rather than potentially traded. We measure prices in home and export markets from the producer&#146;s perspective, and we can be certain that we are comparing prices for products produced in the same plant. This gives us a clean identification strategy. Relative to other work on entry, exit and quantity responses of exporters to exchange rate changes, we have access to panel data on sales to some export destinations for the full population of plants rather than just a sample of larger plants.  Broader impacts: The broader objective of the project is to understand the microeconomic interactions that underly the behavior of real exchange rates at the macro level. The results of the project described here will contribute to our understanding of passthrough of exchange rate changes into import prices and the simultaneous dynamics of import behavior, which form an important transmission channel of monetary and exchange rate policy. The project at hand does not focus on the US, but on the case of exporters in a small open economy (Ireland) exporting to a bigger economy (the UK). This case is particularly relevant to understanding why depreciation of the dollar has seemed to have little impact on import prices and overall imports in recent times, because the competitive position of foreign firms selling in the US market is likely to be very comparable to that of the firms in the data"

Preliminary ethnographic research  in the Cameroonian capital, Yaound, indicates that elite consumers may gain prestige and alliance benefits in the covert trade of increasingly rare forest animals. If confirmed, this finding would challenge the prevailing notion that urban poor Africans are the primary consumers and traders of wildlife. The explanation for this difference may lie in the distinction between the market for rare species, which involves elite consumers and high prices, versus common species and everyday trading.    Randolph will use ethnographic methods to investigate the role of kinship, social status, and economic status in the distribution and consumption  \"bushmeat.\"  She also will collect data to construct ego-centric networks through which she will study social and demographic traits of consumers and sellers, hidden social aspects of the urban trade, and the cultural prestige benefits derived by individual consumers.     Understanding the segmentation of the bushmeat trade will enable  more effective partnering of conservation and development policies to simultaneously address urban livelihood issues for traders and targeted trade regulation for threatened and endangered species. Additionally, because bushmeat consumption has been linked to a variety of health issues, the project will contribute to public health policy. This project is particularly significant because of the urban focus of the research, an aspect of African wild game market studies that remains largely unstudied. Through collaborative efforts with the Johns Hopkins Cameroon Program and the training of Cameroonian university students as research assistants, this research will also contribute to capacity building and shared knowledge with African partners, as well as the training of an American social scientist."

These life history traits depend on food intake and on allocation of that food to body maintenance, activity and making offspring.  Variation in the amount of food eaten can affect nutrient allocation among these traits, changing age at death, activity patterns, and timing, numbers and quality of offspring.  Likewise, increased demands for allocation to activity can reduce allocation to other traits.  Feeding and allocation patterns also affect trait senescence, or loss of function with age.  How the set of life history traits changes with food stress or with activity stress is not well understood.  Using an insect test system, this work will examine how such environmental stresses alter life history traits, using both laboratory physiological experiments and field observations.  Techniques will include stable isotope analysis, insect respirometry, micro-analysis of chemical composition of eggs and measurements of body morphology.  This work will contribute to understanding the impacts of environmental change on organisms' survival and reproduction.  To do this, the work will connect experimental laboratory results with field observations, to build an understanding of how life history traits respond to environmental variation in the wild, and of trait senescence in the wild.  The work will also test the theory of nutrient allocation as the basis for life history trade-offs.      The project will include mentoring of undergraduates, women and minorities in research.  Research results will be used in teaching, and teaching ideas will be published for use by others.  The work builds on extensive field databases at a field station.

Animals in groups communicate sophisticated information about group affiliation, reproductive status and internal state so that bystanders, or eavesdroppers, get valuable information simply from observation. However, it is not known how social information is communicated to and processed by the brain. The experiments in this project ask: How does being watched influence the behavior and physiology of an individual? How does receiving social information alter the brain? To answer the first question, the research team will measure how fighting males change their levels of brain gene expression and sex hormones in relation to being watched by audiences that vary both in sex and dominance status relative to those males.  To answer the second question, females will be exposed to social information about a preferred mate and then circulating hormone levels as well as immediate early gene expression in the brain will be quantified.

Intellectual merit.  The past decade has seen a profound shift in our understanding of the bacterial cell.  It is now clear that the three-dimensional organization of the cell is an integral component of the function of cellular regulatory pathways.  The bacterial cell is highly organized, with many specifically and dynamically localized regulatory proteins, DNA loci, and cytoskeletal proteins. Further, the Caulobacter crescentus cell topology, polar morphology, and the three-dimensional deployment of regulatory and signaling proteins have been shown to be integrated into the operation of the cell cycle genetic control circuitry. Much less is known about the specific mechanisms that effect the dynamic localization of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation or molecular positioning for organelle development. In this project, molecular participants and mechanisms involved in dynamic protein localization are being identified using a genetic screen for mutants that mislocalize the timing or positioning of localized proteins.  This is an essential step to realization of the goal of a kinetic model of the assembly and disassembly of localized multiprotein complexes. The insights from this work will provide a major step forward in our understanding of how cellular regulation operates as an integrated and spatially distributed control system.  The experimental organism is the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, but the insights and mechanisms identified will be generally applicable to all bacterial cells.  Indeed, since positioning of multi-protein complexes to specific membrane-associated positions occurs in most cells, the results will apply to all organisms.    Broader impacts.  The investigator on this grant, Dr. Harley McAdams, has been at the forefront of the emergence of 'systems biology' and development of an integrated, system-level understanding of bacterial cell cycle regulation. His research has emphasized, first, the need to think of the cell as an integrated entity and to identify the logical circuitry of genetic control circuits, and, second, analysis of cellular control systems with the methods used in engineering analysis of more familiar information systems. The McAdams laboratory trains graduate students in the physical and chemical sciences and engineering for careers in biological research. This genetic screening project involves use of automation and advanced computational analysis of cell images as well as sophisticated molecular engineering and genetic analysis. The project involves students with engineering and computational skills as well as students with biochemistry and genetics backgrounds. Research in this interdisciplinary environment provides a unique opportunity for cross-disciplinary students to acquire advanced laboratory skills as well as skills in computational biology and modeling.  Dr. McAdams frequently speaks to engineering and physical science students about interdisciplinary research in biology, and the career opportunities for engineers and physicists in the biological sciences.  This missionary work to the engineering community has been effective in attracting students in engineering and physical sciences into biological research."

This site, dating from between ~350,000to ~290 000 years ago, has yielded very large stone artifact and animal bone assemblages and seven fossil human teeth. For part of its depositional history, Orgnac 3 was a cave, and for another, it was a sink-hole. The site preserves large samples from short time periods within the long Middle Pleistocene interval. It contains charcoal/sooty lenses with burnt bones that have been interpreted as hearths and accumulations of artifacts and bones surrounded by natural rocks that may represent the bases of dwelling structures. For these reasons the Orgnac 3 materials lend themselves to answering many questions about human paleoecology during the middle and late Middle Pleistocene.    Much work in paleoanthropology has focused on one particular aspect of human paleoecology, that of subsistence strategy. When people started acquiring meat and other animal tissues, whether through scavenging or hunting, and how human subsistence strategies have changed over time, remain hotly debated topics. How different human populations might have foraged differently, and the evolutionary import of those differences, are important questions to ask of the archaeological and paleontological records. This is especially true when considering the Middle and Late Pleistocene, when different human species lived on different continents, but by the end of the Pleistocene, only one species remained: Homo sapiens. To reach the ultimate goal of understanding changes in subsistence strategy throughout human history, one must begin with a robust, scientific reconstruction of how a sample faunal assemblage passed through several stages in which hominid activity or natural processes could have altered its composition. This project adopts such a holistic approach to document the carcass acquisition and processing behaviors of the human inhabitants of Orgnac 3 and to examine how these behaviors have changed throughout the evolution of the human species. Once the carcass acquisition and processing behaviors of the Orgnac 3 people have been characterized, these can be compared to other Middle Pleistocene sites in Europe and Africa in order to elucidate how these behaviors have changed through time and across space.    Beyond research questions of interest to prehistoric archaeologists, this project will have a broader impact by providing assistance in graduate student training and strengthening collaborative relationships between institutions in US and France, specifically those between Stanford University and the Centre Europen de Recherches Prhistoriques in Tautavel and Institut de Palontologie Humaine in Paris. This work will increase awareness of one of the oldest and largest fossil human sites in France. Furthermore, the primary data generated here will be made available to the Centre Europen de Recherches Prhistoiriques, for them to use in their own research, curation planning, and pedagogical development (in their educational materials and in the adjoining Centre Europen de Prhistoire )."

Laser light absorption causes the decomposition of the SiC and selective evaporation of silicon leaving a graphene layer on the surface. Using the x-ray beam at the Stanford Synchrotron source crystalline perfection and orientation of the laser-synthesized graphene layer will be investigated. Furthermore, bonding defects of the graphene layer will be investigated spectroscopically.

Intellectual Merit  This award is for a suite of comprehensive field observations to elucidate and quantify the mixing processes in the inner shelf and to directly examine the impact of these processes on inner shelf biological distributions. Predictive modeling of coastal flows requires parameterizations of sub-gridscale processes, which, in the horizontal dimension have characteristic length-scales of 10s to 1000s of meters. This study will provide a comprehensive picture of horizontal dispersion on the inner shelf at these scales and its implications for scalar distributions. It is hypothesized that the physical limitations imposed by vertical boundaries and stratification restrict vertical motions and exchange processes leading to strong anisotropies in the flow field and dispersion in the inner shelf. Previous work has shown that mixing in the bottom boundary layer is scale-dependent in the horizontal direction in spite of the limiting effects of the bottom boundary. It is likely that scale-dependency may be different higher in the water column where stratification may create even greater anisotropies and restrictions on vertical transfer rates, and in the surface mixed layer due to the influence of waves, winds, as well as surface heating and cooling. This project will directly measure lateral dispersion rates in the bottom mixed layer, stratified interior, and surface mixed layer on the inner shelf under different forcing conditions in order to quantify any scale-dependent mixing and highlight the similarities and differences in lateral mixing at different depths. Once the dispersion rates and scale dependencies are determined, they will be used to examine how the lateral rates of mixing may correspond with biological thin layer development, maintenance and degradation. Two, two-week long field experiments will be conducted on the inner shelf of northern Monterey Bay to examine these issues. After deploying an array of moored instruments to measure physical, optical and acoustical properties, the research team will release a tracer dye, in separate releases, within the bottom boundary layer, stratified interior, and surface mixed layer during both the early and late portions of the upwelling season in northern California. The dye?s spatial and temporal distribution will be measured using an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a fast response fluorometer, as well as a tow body equipped with a fluorometer and ancilliary instrumentation that measure concurrently biological and geochemical properties of interest. The dye measurements will be used to quantify the lateral mixing by fitting the data to scale dependent laws, and comparing and contrasting the corresponding rates of dispersion with different climatological and hydrodynamics forcing conditions (winds, surface waves, internal wave, stratification, and turbulence) during these two measurement periods. Connecting the lateral mixing processes and forcing conditions with measured biological distributions (thin layers) will help determine the role of horizontal mixing in homogenizing and/or redistributing biological scalars.    Broader Impacts  This work will provide valuable new insights into the transport and mixing of scalars in the coastal region, particularly at the 'intermediate' scales of 10s to 1000s of meters. It will have a broad scientific impact, especially on interdisciplinary modeling efforts of the inner shelf where estimates and/or parameterizations of lateral mixing cause significant uncertainty.  As coastal populations continue to grow, and pressure on marine ecosystems continues to increase, it will be increasingly important to understand the underlying mechanisms determining transport and/or retention in the nearshore environment. Understanding lateral dispersion in the coastal environment has significant implications not only for the transport/retention of marine larvae, and harmful algal blooms but also for the transport/retention of pollutants. Better understanding of these mixing processes will ultimately be of interest to environmental planners, policy makers and other stakeholders in coastal communities. The proposed research will also support one postdoctoral scholar and two PhD students."

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR)\" competition and includes Stanford University (lead institution), Arizona State University (subaward), and Bucknell University (subaward). This project will utilize the NEES equipment sites at the University of California at Davis, and at the University at Buffalo. The project will experimentally and numerically investigate the properties of resedimented soil following liquefaction, including void ratio distribution and shear strength.  To investigate the properties of cohesionless soil subsequent to liquefaction, a series of coordinated physical model tests, numerical analyses, imaging analyses, and laboratory shear strength tests will be conducted.  Physical model testing will include laboratory column testing, small- and large-scale shake table testing, and centrifuge testing.  Numerical analyses will include simulations of the impact of non-homogeneities (as revealed by the physical model testing) on shear banding and the undrained shear strength of cohesionless soil, and novel computational fluid dynamics- (CFD-) based analyses of resedimentation of cohesionless soils.  Laboratory testing will include shear strength testing on specimens recovered from the physical models, using special techniques to preserve their structure.  Imaging will include bright field microscopy (BFM) and computer-aided tomography (CT) scanning of recovered specimens to evaluate their structure prior to and after liquefaction.    Uniform and non-uniform sands will be liquefied and allowed to reconsolidate at different stress levels. Solidified soils will be removed and freeze-dried for cutting into smaller samples. The heterogeneity of the smaller samples will be quantified through CT, BFM, and digital image processing (DIP). The numerical modeling program will utilize sedimentation theories and CFD implemented in Eulerian framework. The mathematical model will consist of three layers: clarified water, fully liquefied soil, and solidified soils. Shock fronts will be tracked using the volume of fluid (VOF) method. Two numerical modeling schemes will be pursued, the first aimed at predicting the heterogeneity of liquefied soils, and the second aimed at studying the effect of heterogeneity on the post-liquefaction strength.    This year's NEES solicitation seeks \"ground-breaking and transformative basic research\" requiring the use of NEES equipment sites. Much progress has been made in studying and modeling the phase transition process when a soil with a well-defined solid skeleton liquefies and eventually behaves like fluid. The reverse phase transition, in which a liquefied soil solidifies and forms a new solid skeleton, has not received the same level of attention, yet this process could dramatically alter the post-liquefaction properties of such soil, including its shear strength. The proposed work, requiring the use of two NEES testing facilities and focusing on a problem rarely addressed in the literature, satisfies the definition of a ?transformative basic research.?     The project will advance discovery and understanding of the sedimentation, liquefaction, and consolidation processes while promoting teaching, training and learning in the graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as in high school and K-12 levels.  A teaching module on the subject of liquefaction will be integrated into the University Consortium on Instructional Shake Tables (UCIST), a partner of NEES, and will ensure an active undergraduate participation. Visualization tools demonstrating solid-fluid interaction will enhance education and research. Every effort will be made to get underrepresented students and women involved in this project. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository."

This characterization is based on geological maps, remote sensing data, and very brief ground survey. PI plans to systematically survey southern Weyto to determine its geological and paleontological attributes. If the preliminary indicators are accurate, this area may provide deposits useful for testing multiple important hypotheses in paleobiology and geology. Funding is requested here for a one month geological and paleontological survey of the southern Weyto basin to evaluate the potential of these deposits for testing three main sets of hypotheses: the relationship between climate change and mammalian evolution, the biogeographic divergence of the Afar and Omo-Turkana Basin faunas, and the relationship between rifting, uplift, and aridification in East Africa."

Scientific advancement in biology and in understanding disease pathogenesis will likely depend on the analysis of the huge corpus of biomolecular data (eg. microarray, RNA and DNA sequence data). This advancement is linked to the field's ability to continue developing statistical methodologies capable of identifying a robust ``signal'' which can be reproducibly identified in multiple experiments all of which generate noisy data.  The PI has shown how the theoretical framework of spectral analysis with Markov chains unifies several statistical methods for identifying structure in data that is observed with noise: discrete Fourier analysis, correspondence analysis, principle components analysis, as well as spectral clustering.  This unifying framework also provides insight into, and  generalization of, the more traditional methods listed above. Therefore, the PI's proposed research has two major directions.  In one direction, it will continue basic methodological development of exploratory data analysis with a focus on methods capable of identifying biological signals observed in noisy experimental conditions.  In another, it will focus on rigorous statistical analysis of this methodology which is in wide use in statistics, computer science and bioinformatics.    Statistical methods developed here will be particularly aimed at the study of cellular regulation of gene and protein expression.  These cellular mechanisms have wide ranging importance in understanding human disease including cancer and infectious disease.  The data analytic methods developed under this grant will be implemented and made publicly available through Bioconductor, a package in R.  The broad goal of this proposal is to work towards providing a methodological unification of methods in statistics, biology and computer science to biomolecular data.  Thus, it falls roughly into the field of bioinformatics."

However, DNA, its cousin the RNA, and other associated molecules such as enzymes, are also engineering building blocks. Think of them as ?combinatorial Legos? which fit together and inter-operate not just by mechanics and geometry but also using the chemical sequence imprinted on them. This has many revolutionary potential applications. This also poses many mathematical and algorithmic questions which are both interesting in their own right and also provide a framework to devise useful experimental techniques. The PI proposes to conduct research in the emerging field of ?molecular algorithms?, i.e., algorithms which are meant to be implemented on molecules. This study will proceed in two broad directions: molecular machines and molecular circuits. The two areas are linked both thematically and in terms of techniques. We will constantly consult with practitioners in this field, so that the results of this research are both novel and useful.    Intellectual merit: Molecular algorithms require tools and techniques that are considerably different from traditional algorithms. We can not assume building blocks such as memories, actuators, sensors, transistors, processors etc; rather, these are often the things we are trying to devise using more basic primitives such as DNA hybridization, enzymatic reactions, and migration. Consequently, advances in molecular algorithms are likely to require novel mathematical techniques that will enrich the disciplines of coding theory, combinatorial algorithms, and probabilistic analysis.    Broad impact: Molecular machines have been proposed as sensors, actuators, and drug delivery mechanisms. Molecular circuits have the potential to finely control other molecular processes. Much of the hard work in developing these ideas is being done by experimentalists. However, theoretical tools such as the one we propose to develop also have an important role to play in realizing the full potential of this area and in deciding upon the most promising experimental directions. In addition, molecular algorithms could facilitate sophisticated tasks such as counting, shape recognition, precisely controlled crystal growth etc. at nano-scales.    The PI has developed a class in molecular algorithms which he will update and teach bi-annually. Also, many graduate students will receive valuable research experience in this important area."

This Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will develop dynamic resource allocation models for transportation systems. The focus will be on answering the question as to how should pricing schemes be developed for transportation networks to align individual incentives with socially optimal use of the network. Despite a tremendous amount of attention to transportation network pricing and management, the most widely-used models for traffic equilibrium remain static. The shift to intelligent transportation systems necessitates a new class of traffic models, where dynamic behavior is a first order modeling requirement. This EAGER project will develop tractable pricing schemes for efficient dynamic resource allocation in intelligent transportation systems.     Recent innovations in information technology have opened the door to a new frontier of potential research in transportation systems. Information technology enables drivers to obtain real-time updates on traffic conditions, as well as to reconfigure their route choices on the fly. On the other hand, the same information technology options enable a new breed of networked control for transportation systems. By providing intelligent feedback to drivers, transportation system designers hope to control drivers? individual decisions and encourage harmonious and efficient overall use of the roadways."
